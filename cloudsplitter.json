Prompting me now,\r\nhowever belatedly, to apologize and beg your forgiveness.\r\nYou were merely doing your duty, as assistant to your Professor Villard, who\r\nin turn is engaged in a mighty and important task, which is intended, when it\r\nhas been completed, not only to benefit all mankind but also to cast a favorable\r\nlight upon the family of John Brown. And since I myself am both—both a man\r\nand a member of the family of John Brown—then I myself stand to benefit twice\r\nover from your and Professor Villard’s honest labors.\r\nSelf-defeating, then, as well as cruel and foolish of me, to thwart you.\r\nEspecially when you are so clearly an open-minded, sincere, and intelligent\r\nseeker of the truth, the whole truth—so help me, Miss Mayo, I am sorry.",
    "\r\nI ask you to understand, however: I have remained silent for so many years on\r\nall matters touching on Father and our family that by the time you arrived at my\r\ncabin door I had long since ceased even to question my silence. I greeted your\r\npolite arrival and inquiries with a policy made nearly half a century ago, a\r\npolicy neither questioned nor revised in all the years between. Policy had frozen\r\ninto habit, and habit character.\r\nAlso, in the years since the events you are investigating, my life has been that\r\nof an isolate, a shepherd on a mountaintop, situated as far from so-called\r\ncivilization as possible, and it has made me unnaturally brusque and awkward.\r\nNor am I used, especially, to speaking with a young woman.\r\nI remind you of all this, of my character, I guess you could call it, so that you\r\ncan place my remarks, memories, and revelations—even the documents that you\r\nrequested and which I will soon sort out and provide for you—into their proper\r\ncontext. Without continuous consideration of context, no truth told of my\r\nfather’s life and work can be the whole truth. If I have learned nothing else in\r\nthe forty years since his execution, I have learned at least that. It is one of the\r\nmain reasons for my having kept so long so silent. I have sat out here tending\r\nmy sheep on my mountaintop, and the books and newspaper articles and the\r\nmany thick volumes of memoirs have come floating down upon my head like\r\nautumn leaves year after year, and I have read them all, the scurrilous attacks on\r\nFather and me and my brothers in blood and in arms, as well as the foolish,\r\ndreamy, sentimental celebrations of our “heroism” and “manly courage” in\r\ndefense of the Negro—oh, I have read them all! Those who made Father out to\r\nbe mad, I have read them.",
    " Those who called him a common horse thief and\r\nmurderer hiding beneath the blanket of abolitionism, I read them, too. Those\r\nwho met Father and me and my brothers but once, on a cloudy, cold December\r\nafternoon in Kansas, and later wrote of us as if they had ridden with us for\r\nmonths all across the territory—yes, those, too. And those who, on hearing of\r\nFather’s execution, wept with righteousness in their pious Concord parlors,\r\ncomparing him to the very Christ on His very cross—I read them, too, although\r\nit was hard not to smile at the thought of how Father himself would have viewed\r\nthe comparison. Father believed in the incomparable reality of Christ, after all,\r\nnot the incorporeal idea. Father’s cross was a neatly carpentered scaffold in\r\nVirginia, not a spiked pair of rough timbers in Jerusalem.\r\nForgive me, I am wandering. I want to tell you everything—now that I have\r\ndecided to tell a little. It’s as if I have opened a floodgate, and a vast inland sea\r\nof words held back for half a lifetime has commenced to pour through. I knew it\r\nwould be like this. And that’s yet another reason for my prolonged silence—\r\nmade worse, made more emphatic and burdensome and, let me say, made\r\nconfusing, by the irony that the longer I remained silent, the more I had to tell.\r\nMy truth has been held in silence for so long that it has given the field over\r\nentirely to those who have lied and risks having become a lie itself, or at least it\r\nrisks being heard as such. Perhaps even by you. Thus, although I have begun at\r\nlast to speak, and to speak the truth, it feels oddly and at the edges as if I am\r\nlying.\r\nI say again that I am sorry that I rebuffed you the other day. You are young\r\nand may not know, but solitude, extended for a sufficiently long time, becomes\r\nits own reward and nourishment.",
    " And an old man’s voice aloud can become\r\nrepugnant to his own ears, which is perhaps why I have chosen to write to you,\r\nand to write at as great a length as will prove necessary, instead of merely\r\nspeaking with you and politely answering your questions in person as you\r\nwished. The anxious bleat of my sheep, the bark of my dog, and the gurgle and\r\ncrack of my fire—these, for decades, are practically the only voices that I have\r\nheard and spoken back to, until they have become my own voice. It is not a\r\nvoice suitable for a lengthy interview with a young, educated woman like\r\nyourself come all the way out here from the city of New York to my hill in\r\nAltadena, California.\r\nWhat sense could you have made, anyhow, of an old, bearded man bleating,\r\nbarking, and cracking all day and night long? I picture you—had I actually\r\ngranted the interview that you so kindly requested—becoming embarrassed,\r\nconfused, finally angry and resigned; and you, closing your notebook and taking\r\npolite leave of me, reporting back to your eminent Professor Oswald Garrison\r\nVillard at Columbia University that you arrived too late. Poor old Owen Brown,\r\nthird son of John Brown, the last living witness and party to the Pottawatomie\r\nmassacre and the victories and tragedies of Bleeding Kansas and the long,\r\nterrible series of battles in the War Against Slavery that culminated in the\r\ndisastrous raid on Harpers Ferry—that pathetic, aged, solitary man, Owen\r\nBrown, is now quite mad himself, and so we shall never know the truth of\r\nwhether his father, too, was mad. We shall never know if John Brown was in his\r\nright mind when he butchered those men and boys down on the Pottawatomie\r\nthat awful night in ’57. Or whether, when he terrorized the pro-slavers in\r\nKansas, he was in fact the old-time, Puritan hero and military genius that so\r\nmany made him out to be.",
    " Or if, when he took Harpers Ferry and refused to flee\r\ninto the mountains, he had by then lost his mind altogether. The son himself, the\r\nhermit-shepherd Owen Brown, is mad, you would say to your professor (and\r\nperhaps are saying to him even now), and we shall never know conclusively if\r\nthe father was mad also. Thus, given what we already know of John Brown, you\r\nwill say, and in the absence of significant evidence to the contrary, we must\r\nconcur with our century’s received opinion and, before the next century begins,\r\nadjudge him a madman.\r\nI hope, therefore, that your quick receipt of this first of what shall be several,\r\nperhaps many, such letters will slow that judgement and eventually reverse it.\r\nWas my father mad? I realize it is the only question that can matter to you. Since\r\nthey first heard his name, men and women have been asking it. They asked it\r\ncontinuously during his lifetime, even before he became famous. Strangers, loyal\r\nfollowers, enemies, friends, and family alike. It was then and is now no merely\r\nacademic question. And how you and the professor answer it will determine to a\r\nconsiderable degree how you and whoever reads your book will come to view\r\nthe long, savage war between the white race and the black race on this\r\ncontinent. If the book that your good professor is presently composing, though it\r\ncontain all the known and previously unrecorded facts of my father’s life, cannot\r\nshow and declare once and for all that Old Brown either was or was not mad,\r\nthen it will be a useless addition to the head-high pile of useless books already\r\nwritten about him. More than the facts of my father’s hectic life, people do need\r\nto know if he was sane or not. For if he was sane, then terrible things about race\r\nand human nature, especially here in North America, are true.",
    " If he was insane,\r\nthen other, quite different, and perhaps not so terrible things about race and\r\nhuman nature are true.\r\nAnd, yes, just as you said, I am probably the only person remaining alive who\r\nhas the knowledge and information that will enable you and your professor to\r\nanswer the question. But you must understand. The three-hundred-year-long\r\nWar Between the Races, from before the Revolution up to and including Harpers\r\nFerry, was being fought mainly as the War Against Slavery. Then, briefly, in ’61,\r\nit became the War Between the States. And from then until now, there has been\r\nsuch a grieving, angry clamor that I knew I would not be heard, except as one of\r\nthe sons of John Brown trying to justify his father’s and his own bloody deeds—a\r\npuny, crippled man who fled the carnage he helped create and for the rest of his\r\nlong life hid alone in the West.\r\nThe truth is, for us, the so-called Civil War was merely an aftermath. Or,\r\nrather, it was part of a continuum. Just another protracted battle. Ours was very\r\nmuch a minority view, however. It still is. But from the day it began, to\r\nNortherner and Southerner alike, the Civil War was a concussive trauma that\r\nerased all memory of what life had been like before it. On both sides, white\r\nAmericans woke to war and forgot altogether the preceding nightmare, which\r\nhad wakened them in the first place. Or they made it a pastoral dream. Even the\r\nabolitionists forgot.",
    " But for those few of us whose lives had been most thrillingly\r\nlived in the decade preceding the War, one thing has led obviously and with sad\r\npredictability to another, with no break or permanent ending point between the\r\nearly years of the slave uprisings in Haiti and Virginia and the Underground\r\nRailroad in Ohio and New York and the Kansas battles and Harpers Ferry and\r\nthe firing on Fort Sumter and Shiloh and Gettysburg and Vicksburg and\r\nAppomattox Courthouse and the killing of Abraham Lincoln and the savage,\r\ndark, murderous days that have followed, even to today, at century’s end. They\r\nare like beads on a string to us, bubbles of blood on a barbed steel strand that\r\nstretches from the day the first enslaved African was brought ashore in Virginia\r\nto today, and we have not reached the end of it yet.\r\nThus, when the Civil War ended, I found myself feeling towards the rest of my\r\nwhite countrymen, both Northern and Southern, the way Negroes in America,\r\nand Indians, too, must always have felt towards white Americans generally—as\r\nif the white man’s history were separate from ours and did not honor or even\r\nrecognize ours. That is yet another reason why I have remained silent for so\r\nlong. I did not want my testimony captured and used in the manufacture of an\r\nAmerican history that at bottom is alien to me. I did not want to help tell a story\r\nthat, when it does not ignore mine altogether, effectively contradicts it. That\r\nwould be treasonous. It would aid and abet our common enemy, who wants\r\nnothing more than to declare the war between the races non-existent. Or if not\r\nnon-existent, then short-lived and well over.\r\nSo now perhaps you understand somewhat why I drove you off, and why I\r\nhave come in this way to call you back again.",
    "\r\nThere is yet a further reason, I suddenly realize, for my having called you back,\r\nand I must attempt to confess it, painful as it is to admit, even to myself.\r\nI am dying. Or I am already dead and have been dead these forty years, with\r\nnothing left of me, who once was Owen Brown, except a shadow cast on the near\r\nwall by my lamplight and these words tumbling from me like a death rattle, a\r\nlast, prolonged exhalation. Absurd as it may sound to you who read these words,\r\nit is to me the literal truth. I am more the ghost of Owen Brown than I am the\r\nman himself.\r\nAlthough I was but thirty-five years old in ’59 and escaped from Harpers Ferry\r\nlike a rabbit through the corn and ended up safe here on my western\r\nmountaintop, my life since that day has been an after-life. In recent years, as I\r\nhave grown into an old man, there have been dozens, perhaps hundreds, of\r\nmornings when I have wakened in my cold cabin with my lungs flooded and,\r\nbefore the sun has dried the dew off the window pane, have concluded that\r\nsometime during the night I finally died. But then hunger or some other bodily\r\nneed or the animals—my dog scratching at the door, the sheep bleating, the cry\r\nof a hawk—bring me back to the sad awareness that, no, I have not died, not\r\nyet, and thus am obliged once more to grope through the gray veils that wrap\r\nme and come to full wakefulness and begin again the daily rounds of a man\r\nalive.\r\nUntil the night that followed your arrival at my door, however, when I must\r\nindeed have gone deeper into the embrace of death than ever before. So that\r\nwhen in the morning I finally woke, if waking it truly was, I knew beyond all\r\ndoubt that I am now he who was Owen Brown. Not he who is Owen Brown. Not\r\nthat crotchety old man you met growling at you like a bear in its cave, but his\r\npast, his childhood and youth and his young manhood, that’s who I am.",
    " It was as\r\nif your visit had sounded a final knell that drove me into a purgatory which I\r\nhad been longing for all these years but had neither the courage nor the wisdom\r\nto seek on my own. As if, now that I am here, there is no going forward or back,\r\nno possible ascent to heaven or descent to hell, until I have told my story.\r\nThus these words, these letters, and the packets of materials which in time I\r\nwill turn over to you. All my worldly effects, as it were, I bequeath to thee. Make\r\nof them, you and your professor, whatever you will. In the long, ongoing War\r\nBetween the Races, this, I suppose, must be my final act, and I pray only that,\r\nbefore I am in error judged good, if cowardly, and my father mad, if courageous,\r\nI be given the time to complete it.\r\nIt is all very strange. Now that I have opened communications with you, I find\r\nmyself unable to keep my inner voice silent. I have given off all work—my sheep\r\nand the spring lambs wander the grassy hills unaccompanied in search of water\r\nand pasturage, protected only by my faithful little dog, Flossie who returns from\r\nthe herd every few hours to the cabin door and scratches and whines outside, as\r\nif angered by my protracted absence and intent on rousing me from an\r\ninexplicable sleep.\r\nBut I am not asleep. I do now and then drift towards a dozing state, but I am\r\ndriven back from it each time by the rising sound of my voice, as if it, too, has a\r\nwill of its own and, like Flossie, does not want me to sleep. Whether I am seated\r\nat my table, as now, writing the words down, or in my chair in the darkness by\r\nthe window with the silvery moonlight falling across my lap, or lying in my cot\r\nby the back wall staring at the low ceiling all night long and into the next day,\r\nmy ears are filled always with my own voice.",
    " The words are like water in a\r\nbrook that bubbles from an underground spring and spills downhill across rocks\r\nand fallen trees to where it gathers in eddies and builds a dark, still pool, moving\r\nme finally to rise from my cot and sit down at my table and begin again to write\r\nthem down, my purpose being merely to break the little dam or jam and release\r\nthe pressure against it and let the flow of words resume.\r\nIt is more than passing strange. And joyous, somehow. I see where I am, and\r\nyet it is as if I who was Owen Brown have flown from my mountaintop. I have\r\ntoday been recalling an earlier, my first, departure from this place and its\r\nsimilarity to this day’s dying—although that was literal and this, of course, is\r\nmerely figurative. Then, just as now, what a strange joy I felt! It was a full\r\ndecade ago, in the spring of ’89, and I had been lingering alone on this high,\r\ntreeless hill for close to thirty years, waiting for the moment of my death to\r\nfinish its last flash through my weary body, biding my time, helpless and silent\r\nas smoke and with all the patience of the long-dead. I was waiting, silently\r\nwaiting, not so much for my actual death, which meant little to me, one way or\r\nthe other, as for the pine box that contained my bones to be carried three\r\nthousand miles from the hills of California back along the railroad lines to my\r\nfamily’s house and farm in the Adirondack mountain village of North Elba, New\r\nYork. To the place that, because of the Negroes living there, we called\r\nTimbuctoo.\r\nA letter from a distinguished woman in the East who had long honored\r\nFather’s deeds had arrived at my door, just as you arrived in person last week. It\r\ninformed me, not of the needs of an illustrious biographer, as you did, but of the\r\ncoming re-interment of the last of the bodies of those who had fallen with Father\r\nat Harpers Ferry.",
    " The letter invited me to attend the ceremonies, which were to\r\nbe held on the upcoming ninth of May, Father’s birthday, at his gravesite, where\r\nmy brothers’ and companions’ old bones, gathered from shallow graves in\r\nVirginia and elsewhere across the country, were at last to join his.\r\nUntil that cold morning, for the thirty long years since the end came at\r\nHarpers Ferry, I had hoped for no other event, for no additional particularity of\r\ncircumstance, than that my poor bones, too, my remains, at last be interred\r\nthere. With or without some slight ceremony, it did not matter a whit to me—so\r\nlong as they were deposited in my family’s yard in the plot of hard, dark, and\r\nstony ground that surrounded the huge, gray boulder in the meadow before the\r\nhouse. For those many years, I had been waiting for nothing but the fit and\r\nproper burial of my crumbling, shrouded old corpse in that precious dirt\r\nalongside the bodies of my father, John Brown, and my brothers Watson and\r\nOliver, and my companions in arms who had fought beside me in the Kansas\r\nwars or were cut to pieces in the raid on Harpers Ferry or were executed on the\r\nscaffold afterwards.\r\nAll those moldering bodies! All those yellowed, long bones and grimacing\r\nskulls carted in boxes unearthed from shallow graves and buried there alongside\r\none another! And now mine also!\r\nBut, no, not yet. I wrote back at once, saying only that I would not come,\r\ngiving no excuse and explaining nothing. I was still very much alive, and silence\r\nand solitude had to remain my penance and my solace. I would not, I could not,\r\ngive them up.\r\nBut then, one morning shortly after my curt note had been posted, I woke in\r\nmy cot and, as I have said, believed that, finally, I, too, had died. Soon, of\r\ncourse, and as afterwards became usual, I saw that sadly I was not dead yet.",
    " I\r\nwas still he who is Owen Brown, he whose dog wakes him and brings him\r\nshuffling to the door, he who releases his herd of merinos from the fold into the\r\nsloping meadow below, then returns to his cabin and washes his face in cold\r\nwater and commences living another silent, solitary day.\r\nWas it, in hopes that I was wrong, an attempt to test my reluctantly drawn\r\nconclusion that I had not died yet—as perhaps I do here now, writing these\r\nwords to you ten years later? Was it an attempt to accomplish in life some new\r\narrangement for my death? I cannot say why now and could not then, but that\r\nvery day I decided to depart from this mountain for a while and return finally to\r\nour old family home in the Adirondacks, where my only proper grave lies even\r\ntoday. I arranged for the care of my sheep and my dog with a neighbor in the\r\nvalley and departed straightway for the East.\r\nI had long believed, or, to be accurate, had long wished, that I would arrive at\r\nNorth Elba from the east somehow, not the west. That I would emerge from the\r\nbroad shade of Mounts Tahawus and Mclntyre. At my back, long streaks of early\r\nmorning sunlight would slide through familiar notches in the mighty Adirondack\r\nRange and splash down the valleys and spread out at my feet before me like a\r\ngolden sea washing across the tableland. I had imagined that the spirit of Owen\r\nBrown, third son of Osawatomie John Brown, like a spot off the morning sun\r\nitself, would come rapidly up along the broad meadows we named the Plains of\r\nAbraham, for that is what they first brought to our minds, with the snow-\r\ncovered peak of Whiteface beyond the house and a crisp Canada wind striking\r\nout of the northwest.\r\nI pictured it early in the day, still close to sunrise or shortly after it, when at\r\nlast the beloved house stood in front of me.",
    " The house would be pink and gold in\r\nfirst light and stout and square as the day we first came here from Springfield,\r\nthe way Father described it at the supper table in our house down there and\r\ndrew its plan in his notebook to show us. I had imagined the plank door closed\r\ntight and latched against the nightfrost—it was to be early spring or fall, a string\r\nof silver smoke curling from the kitchen chimney, and no smoke at all from the\r\nparlor chimney opposite, where last night’s fire would have long gone out, the\r\nlog turned to ashes, powdery and cold, bricks chilled like ingots.\r\nThese anticipations were left-over memories, however. Rags and tatters\r\nfluttering brightly across my darkened thoughts. From my haunt in the San\r\nGabriel Mountains in the far West, I could not know who lived in the old house\r\nnowadays. My stepmother, Mary, and my sisters and remaining brothers had all\r\nfled the place decades before to Ohio, Iowa, Oregon, and Washington State,\r\nscattered across the country by the winds of war and its callous aftermath. Did\r\nanyone live there at all? The window glass was to have been iced over, etched\r\nwith florid designs, I thought.\r\nNo, I came instead, not from Tahawus and Mclntyre in the east with dreamily\r\nimagined, celestial hoo-rahs and fanfare to announce me, but almost casually, as\r\nif out for a stroll along the road that led from the settlement, where the new\r\ntrain from Albany had let me off. I came walking alone out of the northwest,\r\nwith Lake Placid and scarred old Whiteface Mountain at my back. And I came\r\nnot as a disembodied spot of first sunlight, for I was no spirit and there was no\r\nsun that day—it was a cold, gray mid-morning, with a low sky that threatened\r\nsnow.",
    " I arrived instead as an actual and embodied old man with a long, white\r\nbeard, dressed in my plain wool suit and cloth cap, picking my way along the\r\ndirt road with my hazelwood stick. All the old familiar aches and pains came\r\nwith me, too—the arthritis in the hips and the cold throb of my crippled left\r\narm, uselessly bent against my waist, my permanent banner to boyhood\r\ncarelessness and deceit.\r\nMy return to Timbuctoo in ’89 was closer to dream, however, than to a lived\r\nthing, or even than to memory. At least, that is how I am remembering it now.\r\nThere was a rhythmical, purposeful continuity of sensation and perception, and\r\nno mere disorganized intermingling of fact, emotion, and idea, such as memory\r\nprovides. A snowflake passed by my face, and then several more, and the breeze\r\nabruptly shifted from my back to my front, bringing with it a light, gauzy wash\r\nof snow. The large, wet flakes struck my beard and body, and, amazed, I\r\nwatched them melt away as fast as they fell against my warm clothing and\r\nhands. Whatever world I was presently inhabiting, a dreamer’s, a ghost’s, a\r\nmadman’s, I was surely an integrated part of it, subject to the same physical laws\r\nas were all its other parts. No mere invisible witness to nature, as I had hoped, I\r\nwas in sad fact one of its functioning components. Or else we were both, the\r\nentire natural world and I, merely the imaginings of a larger, third Being.\r\nThe snow shower blew over, and then, suddenly, I realized that I was not\r\nalone on the road. A short ways ahead of me, a group of perhaps a dozen\r\nchildren and a pair of young women walked steadily along in the same direction\r\nas I, marching, it seemed, in loose formation, with one woman at the front and\r\nthe other at the rear. No doubt for the very same reasons as I, they were headed\r\nfrom the village in the direction of the farm.\r\nThey were white people.",
    " I note that because, when I turned and glanced\r\nbehind me, I saw an elderly Negro couple—a man in a dark woolen suit not\r\nunlike mine and a proper wool fedora and a woman in a long black dress,\r\nbonnet, and cape—coming slowly along. They each carried what appeared to be\r\na Bible, as if marching off to church or coming straightway from it. Then, behind\r\nthem, where the road emerged from an overhanging thatch of tall white pines,\r\ncame a second group, six or seven Negro people of various ages, at least three\r\ngenerations. And these Negroes, too, were dressed as if for a formal occasion.\r\nThere was a dark-faced man among them who for a second I thought was\r\nFather’s dear friend and mine, a man whom you may well have heard of by now,\r\nMr. Lyman Epps. I was somewhat disoriented, however, due to fear and\r\nexcitement, and could not be sure. Hadn’t he died long ago? I, of all people,\r\nshould know that. Was this his son, perhaps?\r\nBut, in spite of my confusion, I knew where I was. Not a great deal had\r\nchanged in the thirty years that I had been away. I instantly recognized the land\r\nand the rise and fall of the narrow road, which, owing to the springtime ruts and\r\nmud, obliged me to keep to the high center as I walked. On either side, under\r\nshade in amongst the trees and in the protected glens and dales, slubs of old,\r\ncrusted snow still lingered.\r\nThere was a light wind soughing in the high branches of the pines, and I heard\r\nin the distance the mountain run-off in the West Branch of the Au Sable River,\r\nwhere it gushed under the bridge on the Cascade Road and from there tumbled\r\ndown these rocky heights northeast all the way to Lake Champlain and on to the\r\nSt. Lawrence and the great North Atlantic Ocean beyond.",
    "\r\nOn my right, set up in the sugar maples, was the Thompson farm, gone to ruin\r\nnow, with the barn half-fallen and the fields on either side shifting back to\r\nchokecherry and scrub pine, but still recognizably the same four-square, cleanly\r\nconstructed dwelling place of the family I loved second only to my own. Beyond\r\nthe house, sheds, and barn, and beyond the lilacs gone all wild and tangled and\r\nstill a month from blooming, a grove of paper-white birch trees mingled with\r\naspens on an uphill meadow. Their spindly limbs floated in silhouette inside pale\r\ngreen clouds of new buds, like the delicate, blackened skeletons of birds. On the\r\nfurther slopes, dark maples and oak switches twitched leafless in the breeze.\r\nI was situated at that moment in the turning of the northern year, when the\r\nend of winter and the start of spring overlap like shingles on a roof and the\r\nnatural world seems doubled in thickness and density. A slight shift in the\r\ndirection of the wind cools the air a single degree, and suddenly a puddle of\r\nstanding water is covered with a skin of ice that, seconds later, as the same wind\r\nparts the clouds and opens the sky, melts in the sunlight. At this moment, all is\r\nchange. Transformation seems permanent. I was trembling with a type of\r\nexcitement that I had never felt before, a powerful mixture of anticipation and\r\nregret, as if I somehow knew that eternal gain and irretrievable loss were about\r\nto be parceled out equally—as if the idea of justice were about to be made a\r\nmaterial thing.\r\nI briefly looked back and saw that there were still more people of various ages\r\nand stations filing along, some white and some black, and I recognized that we\r\nwere a procession. There was a horse-drawn carriage just entering the clearing\r\nbefore the Thompson farm, driven by a bearded white man of middle age, with\r\nhis stout wife seated beside him.",
    " Following the carriage came a large, canopied\r\nwagon pulled by two matched teams of rugged Vermont Morgans, with a white\r\nman in a black ministerial suit at the reins and a young Negro man similarly\r\nclothed situated next to him. There seemed to be hundreds of people coming\r\nalong, and though the impulse to stand aside and watch everyone pass by was\r\nstronger than mere curiosity, the impulse to fall in and keep step with the others\r\nwas stronger still, and I turned away and continued forward along the road.\r\nIn a moment, I had passed the turning and entered a section of the road that\r\nled through a stretch of tall white pines, where it was dark as night, almost, and\r\nmore patches of old snow remained, radiating light and cold. A sudden, strong\r\ngust of wind blew through the pines and swirled the branches overhead, filling\r\nmy ears with a sound that made my heart leap with pleasure, for it had been a\r\nlifetime and more, it seemed, since I had last walked beneath pine trees that\r\nsang and danced furiously in the wind like that. Briefly, I was an innocent,\r\nwonderstruck youth again, newly arrived in the Adirondack wilderness. The\r\nroad was covered with a blanket of soft, rust-colored needles, and I inhaled\r\ndeeply, losing all my thoughts in the vinegary smell, stumbling backwards in the\r\nflow of time.\r\nWhen I passed out of the pine forest, the road dwindled to a track and entered\r\na broad, overgrown meadow, yellow and sere with the old, winter-killed grass\r\nand saturated with run-off from the slopes above. We cleared this meadow\r\nourselves the first summer we came to this place, my younger brothers Watson,\r\nSalmon, Oliver, and I, and grazed Father’s Devon cattle on it, leaving the\r\nstingier, rock-strewn, upper fields for the Old Man’s blooded merino sheep.",
    " But\r\nnow the whole expanse of cleared land was drifting back to forest, with only a\r\npatch of it remaining in grass and that spotted all over with new sumac and\r\nmasses of tangled brush.\r\nThe first time that I walked this path to our farm was back in 49, when I came\r\nover from Lake Champlain on the Cascade Road with the family and Lyman Epps\r\nand saw the house here on the southern end of the promontory that we were\r\ntold was called the Tableland but which Father insisted would be called the\r\nPlains of Abraham. In his usual way, he had imagined everything for us\r\nbeforehand—the house was as he had said, and the barn would be exactly where\r\nhe drove his stakes, facing due southeast across the Plains of Abraham into the\r\nmighty Tahawus, as the Iroquois had named it, the Cloudsplitter, so that year-\r\nround, from the barn and from our front door, we could watch the sunrise inch\r\nnorth in spring and then south in fall, passing like a clock hand between it and\r\nFather’s second-favorite mountain, Mclntyre, marking the slow, seasonal turn of\r\nthe heavens—for Father had wanted us to mark God’s perfect logic as much by\r\nthe motion and movement of the planets and sun above as by the symmetries\r\nthat surrounded us here on earth.\r\nSeven years later, I walked up to this place from the Indian Pass accompanied\r\nby a dead man’s body and two fugitive slaves and came to the house and\r\ndelivered all three over to my family and fled this house and valley for Ohio and\r\nthen for Kansas. Of this, you know nothing, of course, but you shall know, I\r\npromise. Three years after that, the Old Man and I came home for the even more\r\nportentous departure for Harpers Ferry. They were hard arrivals and departures.",
    "\r\nBut in between and before and after, there were the thousands of easy, domestic\r\ncomings and goings that a farming family is obliged to make—daily we walked\r\nand sometimes rode this line back through the woods that linked our home to\r\nthe larger world, beating a footpath into a track and a track into a road which\r\nconnected eventually to all the other roads that we would travel together and\r\nalone.\r\nConsidered in all the tossed and turbulent terms of my life, this fading path\r\nthrough the woods—for the trail crossing the meadow had diminished now to\r\nlittle more than that—was like the central nerve of my body, its very spinal cord.\r\nEverything of moment branched off that nerve, everything in a sense originated\r\nthere, and ultimately everything must loop back and end there. And so,\r\napparently, it had, for here I was, walking it again.\r\nThe great, broad plain and our farm just beyond the crest of the meadow were\r\nstill hidden from my view. Up ahead, the children and their female teachers had\r\nnearly reached the crest, and beyond that line were the snow-covered mountain\r\npeaks—pale wedges rising from the near horizon like the sails of approaching\r\ngalleons. Then, one by one, the children followed their teachers over the top and\r\ndisappeared, as if jumping off a precipice. Dutifully, I trudged up the slope\r\nbehind them and in my turn came to the top. And when I gazed down, I saw that\r\nI had arrived finally at my home.\r\nA vast crowd of people had assembled below in the front yard of the house\r\nand all about the front and sides of the barn. There were many wagons, four-in-\r\nhands, buggies, and fancy carriages with men and women seated on them, and\r\nquite a few men up on horseback, and large standing groups of people of all\r\nages.",
    " A significant number of these appeared by their dress and bearing to be\r\npersonages of no slight importance in the world, reverends and top-hatted\r\nbankers and the such. I saw a lot of Negro people there, too, poorer folks than\r\nthe whites, most of them elderly. They kept mainly to the side and to\r\nthemselves, although here and there a richly dressed black man mingled\r\ninformally with the whites, and there were even a few white individuals\r\nstanding amongst the blacks. At the further edges of the crowd, back by the barn\r\nand along the far side of the house, boys and dogs chased one another in the\r\nusual way, while in amongst the adults, numerous small children sat perched\r\nupon their fathers’ shoulders.\r\nThe huge throng was assembled in a vast semi-circle, as if in an ancient\r\namphitheater, between the old house and barn and the great, gray stone in the\r\ncenter. It was a grand scene! With affection and a kind of gratitude, with feelings\r\nbeyond speech, I gazed down on the poor, bare buildings that we had lived and\r\nworked in all those years, that had sheltered and shielded not just us Browns but\r\nalso the hundreds of fugitives who had come to our door seeking succor and\r\nprotection from the wilderness and the snows and cold winds and all the terrors\r\nof the flight from slavery.\r\nAt the center of the arc of the crowd was the huge, gray rock-intimidating,\r\nmysterious. Like a chamber it was, a room filled with solid granite. Next to it\r\nstood the old, Puritan-style slate gravestone that memorialized the death of\r\nGreat-Grandfather John Brown, Father’s namesake, which Father had lugged up\r\nfrom Connecticut so as to memorialize on its other side the death of brother Fred\r\nin Kansas as well. The worn slab marked Father’s own grave now.",
    " A short ways\r\nbeyond the rock was a mast-high flagpole with no flag a-flying, and at its base\r\nthree lines of soldiers in dress uniform had assembled formally in drill order,\r\nstanding at parade rest.\r\nThen came the abrupt further edge of the clearing, where the wide swale of\r\nforest began, copses of fresh-budding hardwoods and great stretches of\r\nevergreens, as the land gradually rose towards the snow-covered peaks of the\r\nmountains, and above the mountains, glowering, dark gray sheets of sky\r\nstretched overhead front to back and covered us all like a canopy. It was to me a\r\nwonderful sight!\r\nI glanced back, and sure enough, here came hundreds more people along\r\nbehind—the same elderly couple and the family of Negroes and the loaded\r\nwagon and carriage I had seen back by the Thompson place, and many more\r\nbehind them, afoot and on horseback and in wagons and coaches. What a\r\nmarvelous celebration! I thought, and hurried on, nearly tumbling in my\r\neagerness to descend from the high overlook to the plain below.\r\nWhen I reached the crowd there, I passed around the back of it and made my\r\nway towards the near side of the house and there slipped along the edge of the\r\ncrowd, around and between carriages and tethered horses. They were all\r\nstrangers to me, and I to them. Thirty years had passed since I had been in a\r\npublic gathering of any sort, and I was a young man then, standing in Father’s\r\nshadow. Who would recognize me now? Whom would I recognize? No one\r\nliving.\r\nMost of the people stood idly by, talking lightly and taking their ease, as if\r\nawaiting the arrival of a master of ceremonies. Their attention seemed to be\r\ndirected with intermittent watchfulness towards Father’s rock at the front, and I\r\nmoved in that same direction myself.",
    " Barely the top of it was visible to me as I\r\npassed through the multitude, but I was drawn straight and swiftly to it, as if the\r\nrock had been magnetized and I were a pin on a leaf afloat in water.\r\nAnd suddenly there I was, clear of the crowd and standing alone before the\r\nrock, with Great-Grandfather Brown’s old slate marker posted beside me on the\r\nright, and Father’s bones buried deep beneath it. In front of me, looming like\r\nsome high altar from pagan times, was the great, gray stone. It seemed to shine\r\nin the milky morning light, and its surface was coldly clarified and dry, like the\r\nskin of a statue of a mythological beast. As I neared the rock, everything else\r\nblurred—the crowd of people, the house and barn, the mountains around—and\r\nfaded altogether from my view. All was silent.\r\nBefore me, incised into the skin of the granite, were words, letters, numerals as\r\nfamiliar to me as the lineaments of my own face, yet a rune. A stonecarver,\r\nsometime in the years since I had seen it last, had cut into the rock the letters\r\nand numerals that spelled out Father’s name and the year of his execution. I\r\nlooked upon them now, and I fairly heard, instead of read, the name and year\r\nspoken aloud in Father’s own unmistakeable voice and pronunciation, John\r\nBrown 1859, as if he himself had been miraculously transformed into that rock\r\nand I into the quaking, white-bearded old man standing here before him, and the\r\nrock had spoken his riddle.\r\nThen, feeling directed to its presence by Father himself, I looked down to my\r\nleft and saw the hole in the ground. The hole was pure black, like carbon, and\r\nneatly cut, about six feet across and six wide. It was freshly dug and deep. From\r\nwhere I stood I could not see the bottom. The soil was dark, wet, having only\r\nrecently thawed, and was heaped in a neat cone at the further side.",
    " I turned\r\naway from the huge boulder and moved slowly towards the blackness—for that\r\nis what it was, a six-foot square of blackness, a door to another world than this—\r\nand felt an almost irresistible tug, a pull beyond yearning, to go forward and\r\nenter it, to step off this too solid earth into blackness, as if taking that final step\r\nwere as simple as walking through the portal of one room into the next.\r\nI stopped, but could not say what stopped me. Gradually, though, I began to\r\nhear noises again, and the crowd and yard and buildings around me drifted back\r\ninto my ken, and I found that I had left Father’s presence and had rejoined the\r\nmultitude. Dogs barked, children cried and laughed, men and women chattered\r\nwith one another. Horses creaked in their harnesses, and wagon wheels crunched\r\nacross the ground. A crow called out. The breeze blew, and clouds shifted\r\noverhead. I smelled tobacco smoke and oiled leather, horse manure, woolen\r\nclothing, and winter-soaked old grass and leaves.\r\nI cannot say if it was cause or effect. But when I found myself once again in\r\nthe midst of the spectacle and not cast outside it, I was able to back quickly\r\naway from the black hole in the ground, to turn and move off from Father’s rock,\r\nthere to take up an obscure position more or less in the middle of the crowd, to\r\nstand and wait with them for the rest of the people to arrive and for the\r\nceremonies to begin.",
    " I was waiting now, like the others, for the speeches, the\r\nprayers, and the singing of the hymns, for the ornate box of the crumbling\r\nremains of eleven murdered men to be lowered into the ground:\r\nWatson Brown\r\nOliver Brown\r\nAlbert Hazlett\r\nJohn Henry Kagi\r\nLewis Leary\r\nWilliam Leeman\r\nDangerfield Newby\r\nAaron Stevens\r\nStewart Taylor\r\nDauphin Thompson\r\nWilliam Thompson\r\nand also the body of this man—Owen Brown—who had lived for so many years\r\nlonger than the others, brought back at last from Altadena, California, to join the\r\nbodies of his martyred brothers and compatriots in the grave beside his father’s\r\ngrave.\r\nBut, instead, I who am Owen Brown stood aside and watched, as the remains\r\nof those eleven men—separately shrouded and then placed together tenderly in a\r\nsingle huge box with their names engraved on a silver plate—disappeared into\r\nthe black hole that had been cut into the hard ground next to Father.\r\nThere were songs, prayers, and speeches. And then the flag went up, and the\r\nsoldiers fired their guns into the air in full military salute.\r\nThe Negro man who so resembled Father’s dearest friend, Lyman Epps—or,\r\ntruly, was it Lyman’s son?—stepped forward and in a trembling, sweet tenor\r\nvoice sang the Old Man’s hymn, “Blow, Ye Trumpets, Blow.”\r\nAnd, finally, the crowd dispersed.\r\nAnd I remained there at our old farm alone—alone to face these somber graves\r\nat the foot of the great, granite stone with Father’s name and death date carved\r\nupon it. Alone before the cold spring wind blowing across the plain from\r\nTahawus. The Cloudsplitter.\r\nAlone—all, all alone!\r\nI hesitate to tell you this, but I must, or you will not understand what I did and\r\nwhy. You will not even understand what I am doing now.\r\nThough the burial ceremonies had long since ended, and the crowds had gone,\r\nI remained, as if forbidden to leave.",
    " If I had believed in the God of my fathers, I\r\nwould have thanked Him for bringing me here at last. But I did not believe in\r\nGod, then or now. So, instead, I thanked my fellow man, the living men and\r\nwomen whom I imagined digging a hole in the dirt way out west and pulling\r\nfrom it the box with my body in it and bringing it here and setting it down into\r\nthe ground before me. For though the carcass is riddled, broken, and finally\r\ndevoured by worms, the spirit survives it, like its very own child. The spirits\r\nwhose bodies lie buried in mountains of Arctic ice or beneath shifting desert\r\nsands or in unmapped potters’ fields paved over by modern city streets—graves\r\nwhere no one pauses, where no one stands and says the name of the dead and\r\ngoes silent and listens for a moment to hear the dead man or woman speak—\r\nthose spirits are just as I have been, far away on a mountain in California all\r\nthese years, speaking only to the sky, the sun, the moon, the cold stars above.\r\nAnd where there are no ears to listen, there is no story to tell. There is only a\r\nghost bawling into the empty night.\r\nThus, at Timbuctoo, standing in the doorway of my family’s house, believing\r\nthat my body lay crumbling in a box alongside the bodies of my father and\r\nbrothers and all those who were with us at Harpers Ferry, I felt assured at last of\r\na listening ear. There I could imagine a curious and affectionate man or woman\r\nor child, a white person or a black, an ordinary American citizen come to this\r\nplace to tender his respects and to wonder about the life of my father, Old John\r\nBrown, Captain Brown, Osawatomie Brown, and his sons and followers who\r\nwere martyred far away in Virginia for their violent opposition to the\r\nenslavement of three million of their fellow Americans.",
    " And because I could\r\nimagine such a person being at that place—I had seen such a person, seen\r\nhundreds of them, that very morning!—then I could imagine myself, for the first\r\ntime since the end came, coming forward coherently into speech. And so I spoke,\r\nand much of what I am telling you now I said then, too.\r\nTake that as an analogy, Miss Mayo. And if my words sometimes seem scattered\r\nto you or if I appear confused by the events in my life or by the actions and\r\nnatures of others, if I wander and ruminate distractedly at times, then, please,\r\nforbear, for at such times I have for a moment or two merely lost my ability to\r\nimagine you reading these words, and my story therefore has briefly come\r\nundone or has regressed to a moan or a childish, half-forgotten, incantatory\r\nchant invoked to ward off my loneliness. It will pass, it will leave off—as soon as\r\nI picture you wandering down the lane that leads to our old farmhouse, where\r\nyou stop and stand thoughtfully for a while before the graves by yonder huge,\r\ngray boulder. Do not worry, for, even though you cannot see me, I will look out\r\nand see you and will come quickly forward to speak to you.\r\nI stand at the door in the evening light and gaze out upon the greening valley\r\nbeyond Father’s somber rock and the graves that surround it, and my thoughts\r\nspread into the past like fingers groping in the dark, touching and then seizing\r\nfamiliar objects that lie situated in oddly unfamiliar relations to one another. In\r\nsuch a way am I obliged to reconstruct my past, rather than to recall it. Or\r\nperhaps simply to construct it for the first time, for it was never so clear and\r\ncoherent back when I was living my life as it seems now.\r\nThese words are my thoughts given shapely proportions and relations to one\r\nanother.",
    " My story is my only remaining possibility for an ongoing life, which is\r\nhow it must be for everyone, living or dead.\r\nIn the distant, dusky light of a fading day in May, I peered across the fresh, wet\r\nmeadow grass to the sooty Adirondack mountains. It was the eighty-ninth\r\nanniversary of my father’s birth; I was alone; it was late in the day; and a\r\ngarrulous apparition is what I had become, lingering at his own, at his father’s,\r\nhis brothers’, and his fallen comrades’ gravesites, speaking into the fast-\r\napproaching night and then talking still, talking even, when it came, in darkness.\r\nLet it darken down. It mattered not a whit to me. Let the earth turn and the\r\nmoon wax and wane and the tides rise and fall. Light or dark, warm or cold,\r\nearly or late—I require no lamp, no fire, no sleep. Let the rain fall, the cold\r\nwinds blow; let the snow come tumbling from the skies and the clouds scatter\r\nand the skies turn bright with sunlight on the morrow and the hills glisten in the\r\ndew.\r\nI no longer know physical discomfort, nor even fatigue. I have been freed of all\r\nthat. The world, simply by virtue of its continuing presence, directly pleasures\r\nme, as would any dream of life delight a man dropped permanently into sleep.\r\nThis may be purgatory, but I take it as a long-desired and wholly unexpected\r\ngift. The dream of a dream come true. And it’s as if at the end of the dream there\r\nwaits, not an awakening, but... what? A further, deeper dream? Silence, perhaps.\r\nYes, the silence of the-truth-be-told.\r\nMy thoughts and memories and even my feelings spin and spiral upwards like\r\nsilk ribbons, where they float vividly amongst old, nearly forgotten memories of\r\nKansas and the wars we fought then and afterwards.",
    " But the ribbons keep losing\r\ntheir momentum and tumble back down again, as if, due to the cold of a\r\nparticular altitude or by having entered some atmospheric level where the\r\nelements differ from those here below, they are converted from silk to iron and\r\nare drawn back to this hard Adirondack earth by the punishing force of gravity.\r\nAgain and again, I move through the abandoned, darkened house and attempt\r\nto leave this place and find that I cannot. The door lies open before me; I came\r\nin through it as easily as a summer breeze. Yet, still, I cannot go back outside,\r\ncross the deserted yard before the large rock and the graves, and pass back along\r\nthe road I came by and head out across the valley towards Mount Tahawus,\r\nretracing my morning steps and disappearing into the mists that hover tonight\r\nover its broad flanks.\r\nWhat seemed at first a blessing—my finding myself located here amongst the\r\ncrowd of mourners and celebrants at the ceremonial burial of the bones of my\r\nbrothers and the other raiders from the Virginia attack—seems now almost a\r\ncurse. I left this farm to all intents and purposes permanently way back in the\r\nautumn of ’54, when I went out to fetch poor brother Fred from Ohio and\r\ninstead disobeyed Father and went down into Kansas with Fred and joined up\r\nwith our older brothers, John and Jason, and thus an account of the events that\r\ntook place during the years that I spent in North Elba is a story of no great\r\nsignificance in history. But those few years seem now like the large wheel in a\r\nclockwork, the wheel that drives all the other wheels, which are smaller than it\r\nand advance more rapidly on their axes and at differing speeds. They measure\r\nout the individual seconds, minutes, and hours of my entire life, of Father’s\r\nentire life and the life of my family.",
    " Driven by that great, slowly turning wheel,\r\nthe smaller wheels tell littler stories, which are like tales or essays measured\r\nagainst a long romance. They are the stories of Bleeding Kansas, of the\r\nabolitionist movement, of the Underground Railroad, of Harpers Ferry, and so\r\non. None of them, however, is my story, the one I am compelled to set down\r\nhere, as if it were a confession of a great crime that, amidst all the fury and in\r\nthe noise and smoke and carnage of great events, somehow went unnoticed\r\nwhen it occurred, unpunished afterwards, and unrecorded by you historians and\r\nbiographers. Mine is the one account that explains all the others, so it is no great\r\nvanity for me to tell it.\r\nEven so, after a lifetime of keeping silent and allowing you historians and\r\nbiographers to establish and make permanent your received truth regarding\r\nJohn Brown and his men, to correct your record is not really why I tell it now. I\r\ntell it now because I cannot cease speaking until I have finally told the truth and\r\ncan lie down in the grave alongside the others, dead, properly dead and buried\r\nand silent, and forgiven by them at last. I have begun to see that they are the\r\nones to whom I speak. Those who died. No one else. Not you, Miss Mayo, and\r\nnot your professor. And I do not haunt them; they haunt me. And their haunting\r\nwill not end until I have revealed, not to you, but to them, my terrible secret.\r\nA man can keep a betrayal like mine shut inside himself and unacknowledged\r\nall the way down the years of his life to his grave. But the dead whom he\r\nbetrayed will not let him rest until he has finally revealed it to himself and\r\nconfessed it to them. The world need not know it; only those whose deaths he\r\ncaused must hear him. The world at large can go on making up, revising, and\r\nbelieving its received truth.",
    " (It will do so anyway—history little notices last-\r\nminute or even deathbed confessions.) The received truth of history is shot\r\nthrough and falsified by unknown secrets carried to the grave.\r\nThe burden of carrying a terrible and incriminating secret for a lifetime, of\r\ndying with it untold, is not great. It’s done all the time. For long periods of one’s\r\nlife—especially if one goes off, as I did, and lives alone on a mountaintop—one\r\ndoesn’t even have to think about it. As the years go by, it grows encrusted with\r\nrationalizations and elaborate, self-serving explanations and gets distorted by the\r\npliability of living memory, one’s own and others’. And so long as one remains\r\nsilent, other people will inevitably construct a believable narrative that makes\r\nthe inexplicable plausible.\r\nWhat really happened at the Pottawatomie massacre? Why did Old Brown go\r\ndown into Harpers Ferry and stay there long after he could have come out alive?\r\nWhy did he take his sons and his sons-in-law and all those other fine young men\r\nto certain death with him? How did his third son, Owen Brown, come to be the\r\none son who escaped? All these inexplicable events have been explained\r\nhundreds of times, hundreds of ways, some of them ingenious, some foolish, all\r\nof them plausible. But all without the backing of truth.\r\nNo matter. So long as I remained silent, so long as I myself did not try to\r\nexplain the inexplicable, my secret went unnoticed and proved thus to be no\r\ngreat burden for me to keep untold, to keep unrevealed, even to myself.\r\nI had believed, when I first agreed to write to you, that it was my task to tell\r\nFather’s untold story, to fill out the historical record with my eyewitness account\r\nso as to revise once and for all the received truth about John Brown and his sons\r\nand followers.",
    " All my life I had resisted doing that, and it seemed wonderful to\r\nme that, as it then appeared, I had been given a final chance to set it down. But\r\nnow it seems that I am not so much revising history as making a confession of a\r\ncrime, a terrible, secret crime which—if I had been able to keep to my original\r\nintentions and long-nurtured desires and had not been obliged to pass beyond\r\nthem, there to discover strange, unexpected new intentions and desires—would\r\nhave remained safely hidden. A crime still known by me alone.\r\nThis, then, is not simply a report to you or Professor Villard. A dead man\r\nconfesses to other dead men so that he may join them. And to dead women, too,\r\nall of them gone before me now—stepmother Mary, sister Ruth, my younger\r\nsisters, Annie, Sarah, and even the lastborn, Ellen—the women who lost and for\r\nthe rest of their lives grieved over father, brother, husband; the women who,\r\nthough their bodies were not buried here alongside Father’s and the others’,\r\nnevertheless are out there with them, waiting to hear me. I confess to mere\r\nacquaintances and strangers, too. I confess to all the men and women, Negro and\r\nwhite, who believed in Father and his mission, who gave him their life’s trust\r\nand treasure and even gave him their sons and brothers.\r\nI peer from the window and now and again step forward into the doorframe and\r\nlook away into the darkness. There they are. All of them are out there; a vast\r\nmultitude silently awaits me, as if I were on a brightly illumined stage and the\r\nbroad, grassy valley were a darkened amphitheater. In dim, reflected moonlight I\r\nsee their sober faces uplifted, expectant, as free of judgement of me as I am of\r\nthem, for they cannot know their own true stories until they have heard mine.",
    "\r\nThey knew me, and they hear me now neither with particular sympathy nor\r\nwithout it, for, while no one of them may have committed any such crime as I,\r\nthey all surely were tempted and at times were as confused as I and as\r\nenfeebled, conflicted, and angry. Certainly my brothers were, and my sisters and\r\nstepmother and the young men who sacrificed their lives in the long war against\r\nslavery. I knew them, too, and in those terrible, fierce years leading up to\r\nHarpers Ferry there was not a one of them who was at all times clearer of motive\r\nand understanding than I. They will not judge me. They will merely hear me out.\r\nMy account is a gift. Permanent rest, for them as much as for me, is impossible\r\nwithout it.\r\nChapter 2\r\nYou may not know this, but I have been remembering what follows here below\r\nand don’t know what else to do with the memory than to convey it by this\r\nmeans to you. Somehow, my words seem more a proper indictment written\r\ndown like this; they cannot be so easily ignored or forgotten or denied by me as\r\nwhen I merely mouth them.\r\nIn the spring of ’31, when he was four months old, my brother Fred’s birth-\r\nname got replaced by the name of an earlier Frederick, a boy who was born\r\nbetween me and Ruth, a five-year-old boy who had died in March that year of\r\nthe ague. I cannot recall even the face of that first Frederick. And, to my regret, I\r\nlong ago forgot the birth-name of the second, the infant who eventually became\r\nthe true Frederick, our Fred, and there is no one else left who would remember\r\nit.\r\nThen, a year and a half after the re-naming, in the autumn of ’32, when my\r\nsister Ruth was three years old and little more than a baby herself, we lost our\r\nmother. We were living in the wilds of New Richmond in western Pennsylvania,\r\nhaving recently removed there from Hudson, in Ohio. The new Frederick was by\r\nthen nearly two.",
    " There was another baby, unnamed, who was born and died a\r\nfew days before my mother herself died. John and Jason were eleven and ten\r\nand were out of school and regularly employed in the tannery with Father. I was\r\neight and thus still a schoolboy.\r\nBut until Mother died, we Browns had been to all appearances a normal family\r\nof our time and place, if a bit overly strict in matters of religion. After that, we\r\nbecame like some ancient Hebrew tribe of wanderers and sufferers, burdened by\r\nthe death of women and children and by our endless obligations to our father’s\r\nrestless, yet implacable, God. Isolated from our neighbors and tangled in\r\ntribulation and increasingly dire financial circumstances, we were weighed down\r\nfurther by complicated vows and covenants that made sense only after Father\r\nhad explained them to us. And even though his explanations made our life\r\nbriefly comprehensible, since there was always a reason for everything that we\r\ndid, over the long run they made things worse, for he likened our life, not to the\r\nlives of the modern American people who surrounded us, but to those of his\r\nBiblical heroes. It was as if, after Mother died, we moved outside of conventional\r\ntime and wandered with our herds and puny belongings through some distant\r\nland and epoch, so that we were not living in Ohio, but in Canaan, not in\r\nPennsylvania, but among the Philistines, not in Massachusetts, but in Pharaoh’s\r\nEgypt.\r\nProbably, Father had viewed himself and others in that peculiarly vivid,\r\nBiblical light from early in his life, for he had been a devout and an unusually\r\nimaginative Christian since boyhood, when he had practically memorized the\r\nentire Bible. But, for me, it began when Mother died.",
    " It seems strange to me\r\nnow, strange that I didn’t know it earlier, when I was still a believer, but as my\r\nChristian faith secretly began to fade, a fading surely occasioned and probably\r\neven caused by the sudden death of my mother, I came gradually, at the same\r\ntime and pace as the fading, to an awareness of the unusual degree to which our\r\nlives as a family and as individuals were described, prescribed, and subscribed\r\nby the Bible. The Word of God. His Holy Writ. As understood, interpreted, and\r\napplied by our father, John Brown. It was almost as if we were characters in the\r\nGood Book and had no other lives or destinies than what Father said had been\r\ngiven to us there.\r\nLet me tell you how it was then. Because after Mother died, everything\r\nchanged, and I want you to know us in the ways we were not generally known,\r\nfor better or worse. I don’t know if somehow Father himself became a different\r\nman, a man more forcefully committed to the liberation of the Negro, and more\r\nreligious, even, than he had been before, or if instead everything and everyone\r\nmerely remained the same, and it was I alone who had changed, a small boy\r\nwho suddenly saw things about his life and circumstances that until then had\r\nbeen invisible to him. But whichever it was, for me, at least, everything changed.\r\nI have been remembering this morning how it was when I entered the\r\ndarkened room, the small front parlor of our log house, and learned that Mother\r\nhad died. It was still a rough and wild section of the country there in New\r\nRichmond, and I came home from the simple, one-room log schoolhouse that\r\nFather had built when we first settled in the region, where the young fellow\r\nfrom Connecticut taught the children of the settlement. Mr. Twichell was his\r\nname, Joseph Twichell. Him you may not know of yet.",
    " He was a fine young\r\nfellow, hardly more than a boy himself, freshly graduated from Yale College.\r\nFather, on one of his early trips east to sell cattle, had met him at an\r\nabolitionists’ meeting and had convinced him to come all the way out to the\r\nWestern Reserve, so that he could serve the Presbyterian God and His Son, not in\r\nNew Haven amongst the wealthy, educated class of people that he sprang from,\r\nbut away in the wilderness, teaching rudimentary reading, writing, and figuring\r\nskills to the children of lowly shepherds, farmers, and tanners.\r\nMr. Twichell was a slender, almost delicate fellow with a pointed Yankee face,\r\nall narrow nose, chin, and forehead—a face made of small, delicate bones. And I\r\nremember him with pleasure and ease, for he bore immense good will towards\r\nchildren, as if he thought the ways in which we were treated by adults would\r\nshape our minds and morals for the remainder of our lives. This was an unusual\r\nperspective in those days, especially way out there in the Western Reserve\r\namongst families with no time for coddling the young, no use for it whatsoever.\r\nTeach them merely what they need to know for doing their basic business and\r\nfor keeping them from being cheated by strangers, then send them home to clear\r\nthe forest and work the farm—that was the prevailing viewpoint.\r\nI returned from school one autumn afternoon along towards dusk, hopping like\r\na red squirrel through fallen leaves. I can hear the rustling sound of the leaves,\r\nash, hickory, and oak, and can smell their dry, cinnamon smell in the clean, cool\r\nautumn air cut through with woodsmoke as I passed the cabins of my\r\nschoolmates in the settlement and moved further down the narrow, rutted road\r\ntowards Father’s tannery and our isolated house just beyond.",
    " Too young to join\r\nmy brothers at the tannery and too old to stay at home with the babies, I went\r\nalone to school in those days. But—and here is something else that you cannot\r\nhave learned elsewhere—I had a constant companion then, an imaginary boy\r\nwho was as real to me as a twin brother and whom I had named Frederick, no\r\ndoubt because of some half-buried worry about the recent transfer of the name\r\nfrom the dead brother to the living one.\r\nI had revealed his existence to no one but Mother, for I knew that she and only\r\nshe would look kindly on him. My companion was, in a strange, prescient way,\r\nvery much like my brother Fred would soon become, when in a few years we in\r\nthe family would begin to understand that, in certain, crucial ways, Fred was\r\ndifferent than the rest of us children, especially we boys—or, to put a finer point\r\non it, that Fred did not feel things the same as we did, as if he were more\r\nsensitive to cold than we or less sensitive to heat—and, as a consequence, Fred\r\nwould have to be treated more carefully than we were. Already Father had\r\nbegun to arrange a special set of rules for Fred, which did not deny him the\r\nrights and privileges enjoyed by the rest of us at the same age but did not\r\nrequire him to take on the same responsibilities, either.\r\nEven then I saw that Father was a genius at legislating rules and regulations\r\nfor the governance of the numerous members of his family, adjudicating over\r\neverything domestic, from the most trivial quarrel and difference of opinion and\r\ndesire to the most complex and lofty difference of principle. Notwithstanding his\r\nclaim that he was, at bottom, even amongst his family, a democrat, Father\r\nexercised all the authority of a monarch, and got away with it, perhaps because\r\nhe was never arbitrary or whimsical and never compromised merely in order to\r\nobtain some vaguely dissatisfying middle ground.",
    " At our supper table, Father’s\r\nseat was the seat of government, all three houses of it, executive, legislative, and\r\njudiciary. His constitution was, of course, the Bible, in particular the Old\r\nTestament. His Declaration of Independence and Preamble were the Books of\r\nGenesis and Deuteronomy. His Bill of Rights was taken straight from the New\r\nTestament: love the Lord thy God above all else, and treat thy neighbor as thou\r\nwouldst have him treat thee. Christ’s first Commandment and His Golden Rule—\r\nthese were the scales upon which Father weighed all our needs, decided all our\r\ndisagreements, and meted out to us our punishments and rewards.\r\nFred’s was a difficult case to rule on, however. From the time he first began to\r\nspeak, it was evident that he was an innocent, that he was a boy incapable of\r\nlying. He was not like the rest of us. He always told the truth with perfect,\r\nnatural, unthinking ease, and as a result—not for any lack of intelligence, but\r\ndue to his primitive honesty—he was incapable of understanding that others\r\noften lied to him. Even after he became a man. Thus, unlike the rest of us, unlike\r\nme in particular, Fred could not protect himself against liars by lying to them\r\nfirst. He was not simple—his understanding in many areas was as good as the\r\nnext fellow’s—but to most people he must have seemed mentally slow. And\r\nbecause they treated him that way and consequently were wont to cheat and\r\nmislead him, we were obliged to protect him as if indeed he were. At home\r\namongst his three older brothers and sister Ruth and the younger ones when\r\nthey came along, our stepmother Mary’s children, his innocence, as he grew\r\nolder, reflected only badly on the rest of us—especially on me, for I was as a boy\r\nan incorrigible and incompetent liar.",
    " It was an early habit, and I do not know\r\nhow it came to be that, but once begun, it could be stopped only with extreme\r\ndiligence and discipline, neither of which could I properly muster myself, and so,\r\nfrequently, I found myself corrected and chastized by others, especially by\r\nFather and his fierce belt.\r\nWhen, with my imaginary Frederick at my side, I turned in at the tannery\r\nyard, I saw at once that something strange and ominous was going on. The\r\nblindfolded horse on the bark-grinder had come to a stop and stood unwatched\r\nin the center of the yard, with the long wooden arm of the grinder still attached.\r\nThere was no smoke coming from the chimneys of the tannery, none of the usual\r\nsigns of activity—of hides being hung to dry, of John, Jason, or the other\r\nworkers hefting baskets of wet bark from the vats or lugging freshly scraped\r\nskins in and out of the low storage sheds, of customers going over accounts with\r\nFather, and so on. And before the house, three saddle horses stood hitched.\r\nWith my Frederick close behind, I began to run towards the house, as if I had\r\nalready divined what had occurred. But I did not know, I could not have known,\r\nfor Mother had seemed perfectly well that morning, although once again she had\r\nnot come to the door and waved us off when in the gray dawn light my\r\nFrederick and I had set out for the schoolhouse. But somehow, suddenly, on this\r\nday I knew—perhaps because I feared so powerfully the loss of my mother that\r\nno other eventuality mattered to me and on this day was finally no longer able\r\nto suppress that fear: I knew that her continuing inability to rise from her bed\r\nwas not what Father had said, the consequence of fatigue and a result of the\r\nsadness of having recently lost her newborn infant.",
    " Those things passed, not\r\neasily but naturally; they were part of the seasonal round of our and our\r\nneighbors’ daily lives: the dark fatigue of women and the death of infants. But\r\nthis, I suddenly believed, was different.\r\nSo strong was my fear of losing Mother that, as long as nothing had happened\r\nto her, no matter what other disaster befell us, it would be as if nothing bad had\r\nhappened at all. Her essential goodness and her love of me compensated for\r\neverything that was not good. And in an unpredictable, unstable world, where\r\nbabies died before children and children died before adults, where without\r\nwarning twisters and droughts and hard freezes descended on us like Biblical\r\nplagues and ruined a year’s and sometimes a lifetime’s careful husbandry of\r\ncrops and livestock, a world in which the God to whom everyone prayed for\r\nmercy and justice seemed not to care one way or the other, in such a precarious,\r\nincomprehensible world, my mother’s love was the only kindly constant, her\r\ngentle smile my sole comfort, her soft, shy voice the music that pacified my\r\nturbulent mind.\r\nI dropped Frederick’s hand and ran full speed towards the house. Frederick\r\nlaughed, as if I had invented a game, and gave chase, trying to tag me. At the\r\ndoor, he finally tagged me on the shoulder and said, “Ha! Got you! Now get me!”\r\nI shook his hand away and tugged frantically on the door and banged on it,\r\ncrying, “Mother! Mother! Let me in!”\r\nIt would not give, try as I might to open it. I was sobbing, hammering against\r\nthe door with my fists now, enraged and terrified. Whether it was barred from\r\nthe inside against me or in my panic I simply could not work the latch, I do not\r\nknow; I hurled my weight against it and kept crying, “Mother! Mother!”\r\nThen suddenly the door swung wide, opening into the small, darkened room. I\r\nfound myself facing Father’s broad chest.",
    " His arms reached around me and held\r\nme tightly to him. I remember his stifling smell of leather and blood and wool. I\r\nglimpsed behind him the shadowy forms of my older brothers, John and Jason,\r\nand several men and a woman, people I knew from their outlines but did not at\r\nthat moment recognize—they were merely adults, large people, shades blocking\r\nout my mother’s light. Foremost amongst them, and darkest, was Father. He\r\nwrapped me in his iron arms, holding me face-first against his woolen shirt, and\r\nsaid, “Owen, come on outside for a moment. Come, son, and let me speak calmly\r\nwith you. Come outside, Owen,” he said, and he moved me backwards out to the\r\nstoop, where my Frederick was standing, bewildered.\r\nFrederick said, “Don’t cry, Owen. I only meant to tag you. I didn’t mean to\r\nhurt you.”\r\nFather held me firmly by the wrist, and as he drew me across the stoop, I\r\nsquirmed and tried in vain to break free of his grasp. “Come here, son,” he said\r\nto me in a low voice. “Come on now, let’s sit down and talk. I must talk a\r\nmoment with you.”\r\nHe sat on the step and finally released his hold on me, and when he did, I\r\nshoved him aside and ran back through the slowly closing door into the house.\r\n“Owen!” he called, but too late.\r\nThe room was dim, cold, and damp, like a sepulchre, and although it was\r\ncrowded with people, I saw no one in the room now, except Mother, who lay on\r\nher and Father’s day-bed near the window, fully dressed, her eyes closed, as if\r\nshe were asleep. Father’s brother, Uncle Frederick, he for whom my dead brother\r\nhad originally been named, was there, up from Ohio, and he quickly moved\r\ntowards me and grabbed me by the shoulders and tried to move me back\r\noutside, away from Mother.\r\nI wrenched myself free of his grasp and ran straight to her and clutched both\r\nher hands in mine.",
    " They were as cold as clay and as inert, and at first I was\r\nafraid of them, as if they were small, dead animals, skinned and dried. But they\r\nwere my mother’s hands, as familiar to me as my own, and they were all I had\r\nleft of her, so I pulled on them, as if to lift her up from her bed or to yank her\r\nback from the abyss into which she was falling. I drew her into a half-seated\r\nposition on the daybed. But her head flopped to one side like a doll’s, and her\r\nweight became too much for me, and her body began to tilt towards the wall.\r\nHer face was turned entirely away from me then, and suddenly it was as if she\r\nwere pulling against my grasp, shoving me from her.\r\nI unclasped my hands from hers and watched her slip away from me. Her body\r\nfell back onto the day-bed and then slid over the lip of the abyss into the\r\ndarkness. She was gone. Gone. And in that instant, although I was still a child, I\r\nunderstood to the bottom of my soul that I was now alone. I knew, too, that I\r\nwould remain so for the rest of my life.\r\nSlowly, I turned and left the darkened room. Father waited outside, still seated\r\non the doorstoop. I sat down beside him, taking the same position there as he,\r\nhead down, hands on knees, back straight. Father and son. We did not speak.\r\nI never saw my mother again. I never saw my imaginary companion, my poor\r\nlost Frederick, again, either. My father would soon remarry, as you know, a good\r\nwoman whom I called only Mary, never Mother, and she would provide him\r\nwith eight more children. But nothing would be the same for me, ever again. I\r\nmark the end of my childhood from that day.\r\nI’m sorry. I can write no more today. I will resume, however, as soon as my\r\nhand is steady again and my mind cleared of this embarrassing self-pity.",
    "\r\nFollowing yesterday’s letter, I’ve been recalling this morning those early days in\r\nNew Richmond and the peaceful prior years of my boyhood in Hudson—both\r\nwildernesses of the old Western Reserve when we resided there, as fraught with\r\ndifficulty and danger on our first arrival and settlement as was our Adirondack\r\nmountain farm later. We lived in our villages then amongst wolves and bears\r\nand mountain lions in deep forests that blocked out all light in the lost ravines.\r\nWe lived close to Indians, Iroquois, mostly, suspicious and withdrawn and silent,\r\nwho sometimes left their forest enclaves and visited our villages to trade, but\r\nmainly kept a safe distance from us. And there was the occasional fugitive slave,\r\ncoming up from Kentucky or the mountains of western Virginia by way of the\r\nUnderground Railroad, run generally by the Quakers back then, and passing\r\nthrough to Canada—a quiet, frightened, day-long visitor hidden in the attic of\r\nour house and spirited on under hay in Father’s wagon as soon as night fell to\r\nthe farm of a Quaker or some fellow radical abolitionist twenty or thirty miles to\r\nthe north.\r\nBut recalling those days of long ago, after having seen all of the civilized world\r\nthat an ordinary man needs to see in order to know the true nature of people in\r\nsociety, I am struck by nothing so much as our sustained virtue and orderliness.\r\nWherever we lived in those days, wherever we set up our house and farm and\r\ncommenced doing business with our neighbors, we were like an island in a sea\r\nof chicanery, godlessness, disorder, and willful ignorance. For we Browns were\r\ndistinct; we were different from most of those who surrounded us. We were\r\nsurrounded not just by wilderness but by reckless sinners.",
    "\r\nAs individuals and as a family, we were sinners, too, of course, like all men\r\nand women, but ours was the fastidious sin of pride, for we were proud of our\r\ndifference and took pleasure in enumerating the ways in which it got daily\r\nmanifested. We even prided ourselves on the number of occasions and the ways\r\nin which our friends and neighbors were affronted by our virtue and orderliness\r\nor found it strange or eccentric and as a result held themselves off from us,\r\nchoosing to view us, as did the Iroquois, from what must have felt to them a safe\r\ndistance.\r\nOur pride, that subtlest and most insidious of sins, got manifested in a variety\r\nof ways, but, all reports to the contrary, I do not believe that we were arrogant.\r\nCertainly Mother, and later my stepmother, Mary, and my sister Ruth were not\r\narrogant. And the younger children were all naturally modest and shy, boys and\r\ngirls alike, and were constantly encouraged to remain so when they ventured out\r\ninto the wider world than home provided, and for the most part they did. My\r\nolder brothers and I, too, strove not to lord it over others less fortunate than we,\r\nless disciplined, less inclined to sacrifice their force and time on earth for the\r\ngreater good, what Father called “the commonweal.” And even Father himself\r\nwas not arrogant—although he was indeed commanding and headstrong—and\r\nmade only those demands on us that he made on himself as well, and made no\r\ndemands on others, but wholly accepted people as he found them. To Father,\r\nother people chose to live our way—and there were a few here and there who\r\ndid—or they chose not to. It was the same to him, either way.",
    "\r\nOn the other hand, though there was never a man so detached from the sinner\r\nwho so loathed sin, when it came to the sin of owning slaves, which Father\r\nlabeled not sin but evil, all his loathing came down at once and in a very\r\npersonal way upon the head of the evil-doer. He brooked no fine distinctions: the\r\nman who pleaded for the kindly treatment of human chattel or, as if it could\r\noccur naturally, like a shift in the seasons, argued for the gradual elimination of\r\nslavery was just as evil as the man who whipped, branded, raped, and slew his\r\nslaves; and he who did not loudly oppose the extension of slavery into the\r\nwestern territories was as despicable as he who hounded escaped slaves all the\r\nway to Canada and branded them on the spot to punish them and to make\r\npursuit and capture easier next time. But with the notable exception of where a\r\nman or woman stood on the question of slavery, when Father considered the\r\ndifference between our way of life and the ways of others, he did not judge them\r\nor lord it over them. He did not condemn or set himself off from our neighbors.\r\nHe merely observed their ways and passed silently by.\r\nAnd he knew all the ways of men and women extremely well. He was no naif,\r\nno bumpkin. My father was not the son of man who stopped up his ears at the\r\nsound of foul language or shut his eyes to the lasciviousness and sensuality that\r\npassed daily before him. He never warned another man or woman off from\r\nspeech or act because he was too delicate of sensibility or too pious or virtuous\r\nto hear of it or witness the thing. He knew what went on between men and\r\nwomen, between men and men, between men and animals even, in the small,\r\ncrowded cabins of the settlements and out in the sheds and barns of our\r\nneighbors.",
    " And he knew what was nightly bought and sold on the streets and\r\nalleys and in the taverns of the towns and cities he visited. The man had read\r\nevery word of his Bible hundreds of times: nothing human beings did with or to\r\none another or themselves shocked him. Only slavery shocked him.\r\nFather was a countryman, after all, a farmer and stockman much admired by\r\nother farmers and stockmen, a workingman who could roll up his sleeves and cut\r\ntimber, tan hides, or build a stone wall alongside the roughest men in the region.\r\nAnd although he was a failure at it, he was a businessman, too, a man who\r\ntraveled widely, to Boston and New York and once even to England and the\r\nEuropean continent, and stayed in hotels and taverns where prostitutes plied\r\ntheir trade in the lobbies and drinking rooms below and visited the men he\r\ntraveled with in their rooms next to his, with only a thin partition between.\r\nFather knew the ways of most men and women, and he did not loudly condemn\r\nthem. He merely elected to behave differently, to go his own way, to keep\r\nhimself pure, and to marry young.\r\nOur virtues as a family were, of course, guided and enforced from our earliest\r\nchildhood years well into adult life by Father’s own example and by his steady\r\ninstruction. Although, when we did become adults, after about the age of sixteen\r\nor so, his manner of dealing with our lapses changed, in that he no longer\r\nchastized us or enforced his will and the wisdom of his ways with the rod and\r\nbelt or punished us for our disobedience. Instead, he merely withdrew from the\r\noffender the shining light of his trust. And no punishment was so powerful a\r\ncorrective as that. He did not require that we share with him his deep,\r\nunquestioning Christian faith, as long as our every act was a reflection of our\r\nbelief in the rightness of the Golden Rule and our love of the Truth.",
    " “If you\r\ncannot be a believing Christian but will nonetheless do unto others as you would\r\nhave them do unto you, and if you will obey the first commandment of Jesus\r\nChrist and only substitute the word ‘Truth’ for God, then I swear that I shall not\r\ndisavow you.” That was his pledge to us.\r\nMy brothers, John and especially Jason, took him at his word, and by the time\r\nthey turned twenty, they had already long abandoned the Christian faith and\r\nhad become rigorous but upright freethinkers in matters of divinity. When I, a\r\nfew years behind, saw that this did not cause a significant rift between them and\r\nFather, I secretly followed suit. Our loss of faith did not please Father, naturally,\r\nand he never ceased to speak of it, but he nonetheless knew that there was no\r\nway he could command us to maintain our faith, any more than God could\r\ncommand him to maintain his. And so, instead, he grieved over it and constantly\r\nupbraided, not us, but himself, for having failed us as a teacher and father.\r\nThere was no way we could disabuse him of this notion. Nor did we especially\r\nwant to, for it was one of his virtues, after all, and we held all his virtues in the\r\nhighest esteem. And because our close adherence to his example was what gave\r\nto the family as a whole its character, its defining nature and difference from\r\nother families, we could not reject the worth of a single one of his virtues\r\nwithout rejecting an essential aspect of the family as well. Which would have\r\nbeen like choosing the life of the outcast. So that if Father grieved over his\r\nfailure as a teacher and father, then John, Jason, and I were obliged to grieve\r\nover our failure as pupils and sons.\r\nNevertheless, despite the differences in degree of our faith in Father’s Lord and\r\nhis Saviour Jesus Christ, we were a pious little clan, we Browns.",
    " The daily round\r\nof prayers and hymn-singing, Father’s morning Bible lessons, and his insistence\r\non interpreting all events in Biblical terms were of great value. They disciplined\r\nand ordered our attention together as individuals and as a group. They woke us\r\nfrom our self-absorbed slumber, connecting us one to the other and all to the\r\nlarger world outside, and linked that world to the great, overarching sphere of\r\nTruth, or God, which we loved before all other truths, or gods.\r\nI remember Father’s surprisingly lovely singing voice—surprising because his\r\nspeaking voice was somewhat reedy and thin, a consequence less of his language\r\nand attitude than of his physical nature. When he sang, however, his voice was\r\nstrong and melodic and pitched high, like a young boy’s. He sang sweetly, yet\r\nwith sufficient force to redden his face, which, when we were children,\r\ninvariably brought smiles to our faces. He would notice, before we could cover\r\nour mouths, and would smile also and sing all the more loudly. In making a\r\njoyful noise unto the Lord, smiles and even laughter were permitted, and our\r\nfavorite hymns were the joyous, loud ones, like “Blow, Ye Trumpets, Blow.” At\r\nprayer, however, or during the daily lesson, we knew to keep our heads lowered,\r\nour brows knitted as if in sober thought, our hands clasped together, and no\r\ncatching one another’s amused eyes when Father, as he occasionally did, due to\r\nthe fervency of his feelings, lost the train of his thought and fell to stammering\r\nor repetition.\r\nIn those days, to anyone who saw us, we were naturally regarded as pious. But\r\nnot in the strict Methodist or old German Lutheran manner, as we have\r\nsometimes been portrayed. No, piety in us Browns was an attitude of respect\r\nwhich we held towards the Truth and our fellow man and which we strove to\r\nmaintain daily in all our small as well as our large affairs.",
    " Our rituals and forms\r\nof worship, which were mainly the basic, old, New England Presbyterian forms,\r\nfunctioned, at least for me and my brothers and, perhaps to a lesser degree, Ruth\r\nand the other, younger children, merely to remind us of that respectful attitude\r\nand, every morning and evening and over every meal, to renew it in our hearts\r\nand to place that attitude of respect, of reverence even, in the forefront of our\r\nminds.\r\nAnd if respect for the truth and our fellow man was the basis of our piety, then\r\nthere was probably no more consistent and singular expression of our piety than\r\nour adherence to the principle of honesty in all our dealings, as much with\r\nstrangers as with each other, as much with enemies as with friends. It sometimes\r\nmade us appear odd to folks who were not so insistent on honest dealings, and it\r\nmade Father, in the end, an incompetent businessman. But for us, that oddity, as\r\nI said, was a point of pride. And although we were often obliged to forgo an easy\r\nadvantage, especially when it came to matters of money, our honest dealings\r\nfrequently obliged decent people in turn to deal the same way with us, and we\r\nwere thus sometimes able to prosper by it.\r\nBut it is well-known that from earliest childhood we Browns were taught not\r\nto lie. We were chastized severely when caught doing it. It was Father’s first\r\ncorollary to his first commandment. If ye love the Truth, then ye cannot lie. Less\r\nwell-known, perhaps, is the fact that I was the worst offender amongst us, as a\r\nchild, that is; and in the early days, when he was a young man and Mother was\r\nalive, Father was more severe in his punishment and in his means of correcting\r\nus children than later, and we sometimes did not understand why he beat us so\r\nenergetically and for so long.",
    " (There was the danger, perhaps especially with me,\r\nof his bending the branch too far and breaking it off, instead of correcting it to\r\nstraightness; or of having it snap back defiantly against him and end up bent the\r\nother way, permanently misshapen. But I knew nothing of that then.)\r\nBy the time I was five or six years old, well before Mother had died, I had\r\nalready begun to manifest the habit of lying to an exceeding degree, even for a\r\nchild. I seemed to take sensual pleasure in it and almost sought out occasions for\r\nlying, making up tales, entire adventures, elaborate encounters, and so on, which\r\nhad never taken place. I went beyond mere exaggeration, and although I\r\noftentimes partially believed in the truth of my accounts, just as I believed in the\r\ncorporeal reality of my imagined companion, Frederick, there nonetheless was a\r\nside of me that was wholly aware of their falsehood and was pleased by it. It\r\ngave me momentarily a sense of importance to say that I had seen a bear when I\r\nhad not, to report on the visit of an Indian when no such person had appeared,\r\nto claim that I had been complimented by the schoolmaster, Mr. Twichell, when\r\nhe had for days ignored me altogether and in fact seemed to think me rather a\r\ndull child.\r\nI remember vividly a significant alteration of this wretched habit, so that in\r\nlater years, when I lied, it was no longer out of blind compulsion but rather as\r\nthe product of a conscious, calculated decision. Once, in New Richmond,\r\nGrandfather Brown, whose namesake I was, came over from Akron to visit us for\r\na few days.",
    " It was during the dark months not long after Mother died, when\r\nFather had fallen into one of his periods of silence and withdrawal and passivity,\r\nand it had gone on dangerously long, so that family members and neighbors,\r\ntoo, were concerned for the welfare of his five children and for his own physical\r\nand mental health. Father was prone to such periods anyhow, especially\r\nfollowing a spate of trouble, but this time he seemed unable to end it, unable to\r\npass through his grief and loss and get on with the everyday business of his life.\r\nGrandfather Brown stayed for a week, I remember, and as the end of it\r\napproached, Father was returning to his old, custodial self. When he roused us at\r\ndawn, the downstairs fires were now lit, and when the workers arrived at the\r\ntannery, Father was there to greet them and lay out the day’s work. In the\r\nevenings, he had resumed his reading aloud from the Bible to the younger\r\nchildren, and before we went to bed he totted up the day’s accomplishments and\r\nfailures of each child and listed tomorrow’s obligations—to wash down the\r\nkitchen floor, sweep the yard, bring in the early peas, repair the sheepfold,\r\nseparate the pullets from the hens, and so on—from each child, according to age\r\nand ability, an accounting of his or her allotted task, and to each child the next\r\nday’s charge.\r\nI myself greeted this return to the old routines with mixed feelings, as if I\r\nalmost missed the gloom and silence and inactivity that had followed Mother’s\r\ndeath. But the others all seemed relieved and for the first time in months happy\r\nand playful again, so I tried to join in. But then, on the final morning of\r\nGrandfather’s visit, when I passed alone through the parlor on my way out to\r\nschool, I espied on the mantelpiece, where he had placed it the night before,\r\nGrandfather’s large gold watch and chain.",
    " It was a particular treasure to him,\r\nengraved with his initials, a bit ostentatious, the one vanity that that otherwise\r\nsimple and utterly unpretentious man indulged in. I picked up the watch and\r\nheld it for a moment, then slipped the watch, which he in his antique way called\r\na chronometer, into my trouser pocket and dashed away to school with it, while\r\nthe old man slept peacefully in the next room.\r\nWhat were my motives? I did not know then, nor do I today. Except to say that\r\nthe timepiece drew me like a talisman, a magical amulet. Since Grandfather’s\r\narrival, I had been studying it at every opportunity, aware constantly of its\r\nlocation, whether in Grandfather’s vest pocket or on the sideboard or\r\nmantelpiece or in his tough, leathery hand. And once I had it in my possession, I\r\nfelt wonderfully, magically empowered by it, as if it were the legendary sword,\r\nExcalibur, instead of a mere man-made timepiece. As if, with the watch in my\r\npocket, I were a grown man in charge of my own life, not a boy anymore.\r\nAt school, in the clearing by the woodshed, where we children loaded the\r\nday’s stovewood to carry inside, I showed the watch to my friends, claiming that\r\nmy grandfather—a man born before the Revolutionary War, I proudly pointed\r\nout—had given it to me, because our names were the same, Owen Brown, which\r\nwas why the initials engraved on its case were the same as mine. The initials\r\nwere mine in actual fact, I said. See? O.J.B.\r\nMy friends, the boys especially, were impressed and crowded round me to see\r\nit the better, imagining the watch and heavy chain, as I did, worn in a Colonial\r\nsoldier’s waistcoat pocket by me, or someone sharply resembling me, as he\r\nmarched heroically into the smoke and fury of Revolutionary battle.\r\nAt once, however, I realized that I had gone too far and now would have to\r\nswear the other children to secrecy.",
    " “Don’t say nothing to Mister Twichell about\r\nit,” I said. “My father was supposed to be the one who got Grandfather’s watch,\r\nand he don’t know yet that it’s gone to me, instead. Grandfather said he’d tell\r\nhim today, while I’m off the place.”\r\nI was betrayed, of course. Not by one of the children, though. By Mr. Twichell\r\nhimself, who had stood at the doorway and had observed my little performance\r\nfrom across the schoolyard. When I passed by the schoolmaster and entered the\r\nbuilding with my armload of firewood, he tapped me lightly on the shoulder,\r\nsmiled down, and said, “Owen, when you have put the wood in the box, come\r\nand show me what you were showing the children.”\r\nI did as instructed, and he took the timepiece and turned it over, examining\r\nthe initials and the fine face with the Roman numerals. “How did you come by\r\nthis?” he gently asked.\r\nI looked around and saw that all the children were watching, waiting for me to\r\nreveal my lie, for at bottom they had known the truth, or at least had known\r\nthat I was lying, and now I was about to be exposed in public, not just as a liar,\r\nbut as a thief as well. I hesitated a second, and Mr. Twichell said again, “How\r\ndid you come by such a marvelous instrument, Owen?”\r\nI sucked in my breath and quickly repeated the lie that I had told the children\r\noutside.\r\nHe gazed at the watch for a few seconds, admiring it, and when he handed it\r\nback to me, asked if I could read the time from the markings on its face. I\r\nnodded yes, and he asked me how I knew which was which, for they weren’t\r\nnumbers, were they? They were X’s and V’s and Vs.\r\n“They’re in the same place as the regular numbers,” I said.\r\nHe said that was so, and then told us to take out our slates and begin the day’s\r\nlesson, which turned out to be—fortuitously, he said, winking broadly at me—\r\nupon the difference between Roman and Arabic numerals.",
    " In a surprisingly short\r\ntime, every child in the room could write in Roman any date the teacher called\r\nout to us and any hour, the number of the states in 1776 and the number today\r\nin 1833, the white population of the United States, the Negro population of the\r\nUnited States, the total of the two, and the difference between.\r\nAt day’s end, when I passed out of the schoolhouse, Mr. Twichell stopped me\r\nat the doorway and handed me a small, folded sheet of paper. “I’m sorry,\r\nOwen,”he said, in a voice so soft that only I could hear it. ‘This is for your father.\r\nPlease, don’t fail to deliver it to him.” I took the note with trembling hand, for I\r\nknew what it said, and slipped it into my trouser pocket, next to Grandfather’s\r\nwatch. “You may read it if you wish;’ Mr. Twichell added. He seemed sad and\r\nguilty, almost, and I knew why. But he had done the right thing. I was the\r\nsinner, not he.\r\nI did not read the note; I could not. I did not deserve to. Dutifully, when I\r\narrived home, I went straight to Father, who was at work inside the tannery, and\r\npassed the note to him. He slowly unfolded the paper and read it. Finally,\r\nwithout a word, he held out his hand before me, and I drew the watch from my\r\npocket and laid it flat in his huge, callused, outstretched hand. He thanked me,\r\nturned to Grandfather, who had been seated on a stool next to the fire, watching,\r\nand gave it over to him. Carefully, Grandfather examined the watch, as if\r\nchecking it for damage, and placed it into his vest pocket. Then he took up his\r\nwalking stick, rose creakily, and walked from the room to the yard, where my\r\nbrothers were at work.\r\nFather said, “Is there anything you can say in your defense, Owen?” His face\r\nwas very sad and downcast, like Mr. Twichell’s.\r\n“No.”\r\nHe sighed. “I thought not. Come with me,” he said.\r\nWe went to the barn, where it was dark.",
    " Motes of hay drifted slowly from the\r\nlofts through beams of light shining through the cracks and openings above. He\r\ntold me to remove my shirt, which I did, while behind me and out of sight he\r\ntook from its nail on the main post of the barn the hated piece of cowhide\r\nwhich, years ago, long before my birth, he had tanned and cut into a long strip\r\nstrictly for the purpose of chastizing his children. I bowed my head and waited,\r\nshivering, for the first blow against the cold skin of my bare back.\r\nAnd when the blow came, the force of it sent my breath from my body, and\r\nbefore I could inhale, the second blow came, harder than the first. Twelve times\r\nhe lashed my back, one for each hour on the face of the watch, he told me, as he\r\nswung the leather strap again and again, each stroke shoving me nearly off my\r\nfeet. Twelve strokes, he said, so that I would forever associate this particular\r\npunishment with my lie. “Twelve strokes for telling people that you owned what\r\nwas owned by another. For lying.” Each stroke drove me a step forward—twelve\r\nsteps in a circle in the dirt floor of the barn.\r\nFinally, he stopped. I had not wept and was surprised by that and wondered if\r\nsomehow, due to my sinful nature, I had lost the capacity for it. Father said,\r\n“There are also sixty minutes on the face of a watch, Owen. And not only did\r\nyou lie, you stole. You coveted your grandfather’s property and stole it from\r\nhim.” To my amazement, then, Father turned me around to face him and handed\r\nme the leather strap and stripped off his own shirt. “As much as you’ve failed me\r\nas a son, I’ve failed you as a father,” he said, and he got down on his knees\r\nbefore me. “We’re connected, our sins are connected, in the same way as the\r\nsixty minutes and the twelve hours on the face of Grandfather’s watch are\r\nconnected. Therefore, you must place sixty lashes on my back.",
    " Then you’ll never\r\nforget how we, you and I, and Grandfather, too, all of us, are connected in all\r\nour thoughts and deeds.”\r\nBewildered at first and frightened by his command, I nonetheless did as I was\r\ntold and struck him across his naked back with the leather, his own whip of\r\nchastizement. It was a feeble blow, but it was all I could muster. “Harder!” he\r\ninstructed, and I obeyed. “Harder still!” he commanded, and so I did, again and\r\nagain, growing stronger with each blow, until I had lashed him all sixty times.\r\nAnd then, at the sixtieth and final blow, at last I began weeping copious tears.\r\n“Now, Owen, now you see how it is between God and man,” Father said to me.\r\n“Now you’re weeping. And when the Bible says, ‘Jesus wept,’ you know why He\r\nwept. Don’t you?”\r\nI could not answer.\r\n“Don’t you?”\r\n“Yes,” I said. “I understand now.” And I put my shirt back on and left him\r\nthere alone in the dim light of the barn, praying quietly to God for forgiveness.\r\nI will tell you another story of our life then and of early deceit and punishment,\r\none that, like the other, will bear significantly on later events. More so than any\r\nof our neighbors, wherever we lived, we Browns kept the Sabbath holy. Defined\r\nprecisely, in the way of Father’s literal ancestors, the old New England Puritans,\r\nand of his spiritual forebears, the ancient Hebrews, our Sabbath began on\r\nSaturday night at sundown and ended at sundown the following day. Father\r\nbrooked no variations or exceptions to this rule. Sometimes we children argued\r\nwith him as to whether the Saturday sun had actually set yet, for there was still\r\nlight filtering through the trees from the west, and John or Jason might contend\r\nthat if the trees behind the house had been cut, then there would be at least\r\nanother half-hour of daylight, so it was not truly sunset.",
    " But Father would have\r\nnone of that, answering, “Yes, John, and I suppose if the western hills were not\r\nthere, we’d have fully an hour of daylight left. Come in now, boys, and honor\r\nthe Lord with your silence.”\r\nAnd after a few more minutes of broody grousing around outside, we’d give up\r\nand come trooping into the house, latching the door behind, to commence our\r\ntwenty-four hours of confinement, of silence, prayer, and contemplation of the\r\nLord. It was an imprisonment, broken only by the need the next morning early to\r\ntend to the animals and later to join in the few hours of worship at church that,\r\nwhen we were young and living in Hudson and New Richmond, Father was still\r\nable to insist on. Of course, after he broke with the Hudson Congregationalists\r\nover the slavery question back in ’37, an event you have no doubt already\r\nuncovered in your researches, after that, we no longer had even the diversion of\r\nchurch services when the Sabbath came around. Instead, we prayed and sang\r\ntogether at home, and Father preached.\r\nIt was difficult for us children, though, especially when we were very young.\r\nWe moped and drifted somberly about the house, not free even to work or\r\nwhittle some little tool or toy, no spinning or weaving for the females, no\r\ncooking, no household projects, for any of us. Silence, prayer, contemplation,\r\nand—except for the Bible—no reading. From our rooms upstairs we peered\r\ndreamily out the windows, as ordinary Christians passed down the road on their\r\nway to town or cut through the yard into the woods beyond with their muskets\r\non their shoulders, gone deer hunting or out for grouse or partridge, and how we\r\nenvied them. The girls as much as we boys.",
    " We were all fairly high-strung, active\r\nchildren used to constant physical exertion, and to put a twenty-four-hour halt\r\nsuddenly once a week on our wild spirits, which usually got exercised harmlessly\r\nin work and outdoor play and sports, was an extreme imposition, often too\r\nextreme for us to place upon ourselves without heavy enforcement from Father.\r\nSometimes, usually by early afternoon on Sunday, by which time we had\r\nbecome explosive from the confinement and silence, we older boys would\r\ncontrive to escape from the house for a few hours and return before sundown\r\nwithout being missed. Father’s habit was to retire to the parlor and sit in his\r\nchair by the window with his Bible on his lap and read silently, now and then\r\ndozing off. It was usually one of the younger children who saw the Old Man’s\r\nchin finally fall to his chest and heard him start to snore, and who, on our\r\norders, would tiptoe up the narrow stairs to the rooms above with this welcome\r\nintelligence, and, John in the lead, we older boys, sometimes with Ruth tagging\r\nalong behind, slid open a window and crept along the ridge of the shed roof to\r\nwhere we swung out onto the branch of a maple tree and quickly scrambled to\r\nthe ground. Then for a few hours we were free to race through the woods like\r\nbuckskins, shrieking and hollering to one another, making all the wild noises\r\nthat for fifteen or twenty long hours we had kept bottled up inside our chests.\r\nI remember, for powerful reasons, one Sabbath in particular, which I will\r\ndescribe, for it has a meaning that extends into the later part of my story. It was\r\nlate in the fall of ’33, when I was but nine years old, the year after Mother died,\r\nand our stepmother, Mary, had been living with us for only a few months.",
    " A\r\nnearby neighbor and not much more than a girl herself, Mary had first been\r\nhired by Father to keep house and care for his younger children during the days,\r\nwhile he ran the tannery, but soon he married her. She was then pregnant with\r\nher first child, Sarah, born the following spring. I remember little else of that sad\r\nwhirl of a year, except what happened to me on one crisp, sunshiny day, when\r\nJohn, Jason, and I, as we had done a hundred or more times, made our escape\r\nfrom our father’s and new stepmother’s dark, silent house to the large, bright\r\nworld outside.\r\nI was then a cold, withdrawn child, hopelessly saddened by the death of my\r\nmother. The pain of my days and nights was such that I thought of little else and\r\nthus was to all appearances a permanently distracted child, one of those children\r\nwho seem neither to know nor to care where they are or who is with them. I was\r\na boy whose gaze was always inward and fixed there, not on himself, but on\r\nsome imagined closed door. I have seen dogs whose beloved masters have gone\r\ninto the house, leaving the animals to wait outside, there to sit on the cold stoop,\r\nstaring at the door with unbroken gaze. I was like that poor animal, and the door\r\nwas the death of my mother.\r\nJohn went first out the window and crept along the ridge of the steeply\r\npitched roof of the shed, followed by Jason. Then me. At the end of the roofline,\r\nthere was a two-storey drop to the ground, which had been dug away for the\r\nentry to our root cellar below. A sturdy, full-grown maple tree stood at the back\r\nof the shed, with several branches close enough to the structure that a medium-\r\nsized boy could in a single move slide down from the ridge of the roof to the\r\neave, where he could leap out and catch onto the tree and from there make his\r\nway easily to the ground.",
    " Without hesitating, John reached the end of the ridge,\r\nturned, squatted, and duck-walked quickly down the wood-shingled slope,\r\nsprang into the air, grabbed the branch of the tree, and like a squirrel hurried\r\ndown its length. Jason, grinning, was right behind him.\r\nThen came I, walking in a kind of haze. I made my way to the end of the roof.\r\nBut instead of stopping there and lowering myself to a sliding position, like the\r\nothers, I simply continued straight on, as if the ridge of the roof extended below\r\nme. I remember stepping off the roof into open space and falling for a very long\r\ntime through sunlight and bright green leaves and blue sky in a dreamy\r\ndownward flight, pulled, not by gravity, but by some force even more powerful\r\nthan gravity. I was like the boy Icarus, who flew too near the sun on unnatural\r\nwings and was hurled back to earth as punishment for his pride and vanity.\r\nDown, down I fell, crashing at last against the stone steps to the root cellar.\r\nI must have reached out at the last second with my left arm, as if to push the\r\nground away, for the arm lay beneath me, crushed by my own weight and the\r\nforce of my fall. I was fully conscious and at first felt no particular pain, but\r\nwhen John and Jason reached me and rolled me over, I saw that my arm had\r\nbeen snapped almost in two by the cut edge of the stone steps. Jason began to\r\nhowl at the sight of it, for one of the bones above the wrist had torn through the\r\nflesh and sleeve, and the arm was gushing blood.\r\nI was in terrible pain then. I could not say anything; I could not even cry.\r\nEverything was yellow and red, as if the earth had caught fire. Jason was\r\nbawling in terror. John whispered hoarsely, “Shut up, Jason! Just shut up! You’ll\r\nbring the Old Man!” But then he saw my arm and realized that it was all up with\r\nus. “Run and get Father!” he said. “But go back up the tree way.",
    " Go through the\r\nhouse, tell him Owen fell from the roof and we saw him from inside. He won’t\r\nlick Owen now anyhow, and maybe he’ll let us off, too.”\r\nJason did as he was told, and a moment later Father appeared, towering over\r\nme and John, his huge, dark shape blocking out the yellow sky. John stood and\r\nstepped quickly away. “He fell off the roof, Father,” he said. “We saw him from\r\ninside.”\r\n“Yes. So it seems,”Father said. His hands were chunked in fists on his hips, and\r\nhe surveyed the scene, looking first up at the ridge of the roof, then along our\r\nroute to the eave, to the maple tree and the ground.\r\nTo John, Father said, “You and Jason came out the window and climbed down\r\nthe tree to help him, did you?”\r\n“Yes, Father.”\r\nSwiftly, he descended the steps to where I lay all crumpled and broken.\r\nCrouching over me and examining my arm, he said to me, “You appear to have\r\nbeen sufficiently punished, Owen. I’ll not add to it. Your brothers, however, will\r\nhave to wait for theirs.”\r\nI remember Father tearing the sleeve off my shirt and tying the scrap of cloth\r\ntightly around my arm above the elbow to stop the bleeding, talking calmly all\r\nthe while to the other boys, saying to them that, because they were my elders,\r\nhe held them responsible for this injury, and they were only making it worse for\r\nthemselves by lying about it now. He instructed Jason to bring him some\r\nkindling sticks for a splint from the woodbox inside and a sheet from one of the\r\nbeds, and then he grasped my broken arm with both his powerful hands, and\r\nwhen he wrenched the bones back into alignment, the pain was too much for me\r\nto bear, and I lost consciousness.",
    "\r\nI am recalling this event now with difficulty and almost as if it happened to\r\nanother person, for it was so many years ago, and the crippled arm of the man I\r\nlater became completely displaced the pain endured by the nine-year-old boy I\r\nwas then. My arm did not heal straight and remained locked in a bent position,\r\nas you may have observed when we met, and all my life my left hand has\r\nworked more like a clever claw than as a proper match to its twin. It was indeed,\r\njust as Father said, my punishment. It was a permanent mark, an emblem, placed\r\nupon my body like the mark of Cain, which all could see and I myself would\r\nnever be able to forget. So that, all my life, every time I reached out with both\r\narms to pick up a lamb or shear a sheep, every time I laid a book on my lap and\r\nopened it, every time I sat down to eat or prepared to dress myself or tie my\r\nshoes or undertook some simple household task, I would remember not the pain\r\nof my fall and the long recovery and healing afterwards, but the fact of my\r\nhaving disobeyed and deceived Father.\r\nIt was the last time any of us sneaked out of the house on the Sabbath,\r\nalthough I suspect that years later, when the event had faded into family lore,\r\nsome of the younger children, Salmon, Watson, and Oliver, took their Sabbath-\r\nday turn at chancing Father’s wrath. We never spoke of it, but no doubt John\r\nand Jason were chastized severely with Father’s leather strip. Although nearly as\r\ntall as Father, especially John, who turned thirteen that year, they were boys\r\nstill and slender, and Father had no compunctions then about laying on the rod.",
    "\r\nI do know that for many weeks, while I carried my arm like a dead thing in a\r\nsling, they were made to do my chores, and long years later, whenever we\r\nworked alongside one another, they were still somewhat solicitous of me, as if\r\nthey had retained a measure of guilt for my being crippled. I, of course, as I have\r\ndone here, blamed only myself.\r\nThat was in New Richmond, but today I am reminded of an episode from those\r\ndays in Hudson, Ohio, before we went to the Pennsylvania settlement. It was one\r\nof the few occasions when we boys managed to get the best of Father. John,\r\nJason, and I stole some early cherries from the orchard of our Uncle Frederick,\r\nwho lived nearby. It was done at John’s instigation, of course—Jason, even as a\r\nboy, was unnaturally scrupulous about such things, and I, who was then about\r\nseven (Mother was still alive, I remember that, so I must have been seven), was\r\nalways the follower of my elder brothers. One of the hired girls who lived and\r\nworked at Uncle Frederick’s saw us stealing the cherries and reported it to her\r\nolder sister, and together they marched straight to their employer and told him\r\nof our crime, exaggerating by tenfold the small quantity of cherries we had made\r\noff with.\r\nAfter Uncle Frederick had taken the girls’ information to Father, we received\r\nfrom Father a quick licking, which was appropriately perfunctory, considering\r\nthe smallness of our crime, but it left us, especially John, feeling vengeful\r\nagainst the hired girls, whose names were Sally and Annie Mulcahy, poor,\r\norphaned Irish girls brought out west from the city of Pittsburgh. They were near\r\nour age, and I suppose we believed that they had betrayed us to the adults out of\r\nno more decent impulse than to advantage themselves at our expense.\r\nWithin hours of our licking, John had filched from the barn a small tin of cow-\r\nitch.",
    " You, a city woman, may never have heard of it, but “cow-itch” is the\r\ncommon name for a salve infused with the hairs of the cowhage plant, which\r\nhairs, applied to human skin, burrow into the skin at once, causing great pain for\r\na long time, as if barbed needles had been thrust into the sufferer’s nerves. It is\r\nexcruciatingly painful against human skin and sears it for hours afterwards and\r\ncannot be washed or wiped off. We used it as a vermifuge against certain\r\ndiseases of the skin of cattle and sheep. Father always kept a supply with him,\r\nfor even when he traveled, he brought along a medicine kit for animals; if not\r\nfor his own livestock, then for demonstration purposes, as Father was forever\r\neducating the farmers and cattlemen and sheepmen he met along the way.\r\nThat evening after supper, we sneaked over to Uncle Frederick’s house and\r\nsmeared the stuff liberally over the seats of the outhouse, which we knew was\r\nused strictly by the Mulcahy girls. They lived in an attic above the kitchen wing\r\nand had a separate entrance and staircase to their quarters. We had often noticed\r\nthem coming and going early and late, and we knew that they usually visited the\r\nouthouse together, especially after dark. In fact, their practice, strange to us, had\r\nbecome something of a joke to Uncle Frederick and the rest of the family (not to\r\nFather, naturally, nor to Mother, both of whom disapproved of coarse humor).\r\nBut Uncle Frederick liked to say that Sally Mulcahy couldn’t do her business\r\nwithout Sister Annie along, and Annie couldn’t do hers without Sister Sally. So\r\nfar from home and living on the frontier among strangers, the girls were, of\r\ncourse, merely afraid and naturally shy.\r\nNone of that mattered to us, however. When we had finished our devious\r\nwork, we hid in the bushes near the outhouse and waited for the results.",
    " Shortly\r\nbefore dark, the two girls came tripping down the outside stairs from their attic,\r\ncrossed the back yard to the outhouse, and went inside. In less than a minute,\r\none of the girls began to shriek. Then the other. “Something’s bit me! Ow-w-w!\r\nSomething’s bit me!” cried Annie. “I’m afire!” her sister answered. “Me bottom’s\r\nafire! Ow-w-w!” We, of course, thought the whole thing hilarious and could\r\nbarely keep still or silent, while the girls howled in terrible pain. They ran from\r\nthe outhouse, their skirts up and knickers down and their bright red fannies\r\naflame. Laughing and clapping one another on the back, we three bad boys crept\r\noff through the underbrush to home, properly avenged.\r\nIt did not take long, however, for Uncle Frederick and Aunt Martha to\r\nconclude that their Irish girls had been victimized by none other than the Brown\r\nboys, who, in their view, were allowed by Father to run wild as Indians anyhow.\r\nFrederick, who was Father’s younger brother and a deacon in the Congregational\r\nChurch, was a shopkeeper in the town of Hudson. He was less rural and pious\r\nthan Father, less withdrawn from the larger community, and despite his\r\nsometimes bawdy humor, he was a stern, demanding man. He and his wife,\r\nMartha, were childless and perhaps envied Father’s much admired fruitfulness\r\nand thus thought him not as properly rigorous a parent as they themselves\r\nwould have been, had the Lord blessed them in a similar way.\r\nWhen Martha and Frederick brought their accusations of our “vicious, bad\r\nbehavior” to Father, he agreed to punish us severely, but only if we were proven\r\nguilty by objective evidence or confession. To his credit, Father never simply\r\nsided with adults against children. And there being no objective evidence, no\r\neye-witnesses, he needed a confession. Thus we were interrogated by him for\r\nseveral long hours that night.",
    " But we did not crack. We simply denied that we\r\nhad been over at Uncle Frederick’s house and claimed that we’d been hunting up\r\na lost lamb at the time of the incident, and no amount of verbal rebuke or\r\nrecrimination from Father made us back down. Secretly, we believed that we\r\nhad been in the right and our lie was justifiable. Our earlier punishment for\r\nstealing the cherries had not fit the crime. Finally, Father seemed to give up and\r\ntold us that we’d have to sleep in the haymow in the barn tonight. Not as\r\npunishment, he said, but as an opportunity to discuss amongst ourselves the\r\nwrongfulness of our act and the nasty work we were doing to our souls by\r\nrefusing to confess it.\r\nThis was a ruse. The haymow, where we sometimes slept by choice on hot\r\nsummer nights or for occasional mild punishment on cold nights, had a scuttle\r\nthat led directly to the cattle stanchions below. We knew from past experience\r\nthat a person could stand below the scuttle and hear every whispered word\r\nabove: we had stood there ourselves and overheard conversations above that\r\nwere presumed to be private, and Father had done it to us as well, repeating our\r\noverheard words back to us later as a joke.\r\nWe vowed, therefore, to be silent, and no sooner had we settled ourselves for\r\nsleep in the haymow than we heard the barn door below creak open and a few\r\nseconds later heard Father’s breathing and now and then heard him shifting his\r\nweight at the lower end of the scuttle. For a long time, we listened to him, alert\r\nas deer. Suddenly, John got up from the hay where we lay and loudly\r\nannounced, “I’ll tell you, boys, if someone’s standing down there at the bottom\r\nof the scuttle, he’s going to get clubbed with this!",
    "” Whereupon, in a fury, he\r\npicked up a large chunk of wood, a heavy piece of a joist four or five feet long,\r\nand strode to the scuttle and without hesitation simply tossed it down the chute.\r\nIt was a startling thing to do! If it had hit Father, it might have killed him. But\r\nthe Old Man must have jumped aside at the last second, for we heard the timber\r\nbang resoundingly against the floor below and, an instant later, heard the barn\r\ndoor open and then close, as Father tiptoed away. I remember lying up there in\r\nthe hay for a long time afterwards, shaking with fear and biting off a sudden,\r\ninexplicable impulse to laugh aloud.\r\nJohn was altogether silent and lay a ways apart from me and Jason, and, when\r\nJason said, “What if you had hit him?” did not answer. Turning to me, Jason\r\nsaid, “You know, we’re lucky it didn’t hit him,” and to my astonishment I found\r\nmyself laughing loudly, wildly, almost crying. I rolled back in the hay and\r\nturned myself over and around, squirming like a snake, all the while laughing\r\nhilariously, as if a great joke had just been told me. And when at last the\r\nlaughter stopped, and I lay still, I realized that I had wet myself. My trousers\r\nwere soaked. Ashamed and miserable then, I crawled as far from my brothers in\r\nthe haymow as I could get and curled up like a little animal in the far corner and\r\nlay awake for most of the rest of the night.\r\nWe had defeated Father, yes, indeed, but the event had terrified us. Or at least\r\nit had terrified me. As for my brothers, I cannot say. It was one of those things\r\nwe never spoke about afterwards, even years later, when there was a second\r\nhumorous event involving cow-itch, which with surprising pointedness, involved\r\nFather as well.\r\nI wonder if I should tell it here, for it seems, except in my memory of the\r\nevent, unrelated.",
    " Yet there is no more compelling principle of organization in\r\nthis long telling than that of memory, and no other principle of selection than\r\nthat of revealing to you what you cannot otherwise know. So, yes, I’ll tell it here,\r\nand you can decide for yourself if you can take from it further understanding of\r\nmy father and of me.\r\nOne night many years later than the event described above, when we were\r\nliving in Springfield—in the fall of ’47, it must have been, the year before Father\r\nmade his first journey to North Elba—after several nights of listening to John\r\npreach the virtues of some of the newer sciences and health therapies, such as\r\nphrenology and Mesmerism, which he was then studying in a mail-order course\r\nfrom New York City, Father, who had been airily dismissive of all such notions,\r\nagreed to attend a demonstration by a well-known hypnotist, a Professor La Roy\r\nSunderland. Coming from Father, this was a considerable and unexpected\r\nconcession, and John was delighted by it.\r\nTogether, the three of us, Father, John, and I, marched off immediately after\r\nsupper to the Palace Theater, where we took our seats as near to the front as\r\npossible. The Professor was an imposing figure of a man, with a flowing blond\r\nbeard and a scarlet face and a grand, oratorical voice and manner. Most if not all\r\nof the people in the audience that night were true believers in the powers of\r\nhypnotism, so the Professor had the pleasure of speaking to the already\r\nconverted, and his demonstration was laced with sarcastic, condescending\r\nreferences to those ignorant folks who, like Father, “preferred superstition to\r\nscience.",
    "” This did not sit well with Father, naturally, and he squirmed and\r\nmuttered throughout, as the florid Professor, with charts of the brain and\r\ndiagrams of nervous impulses and connectors, explained how hypnotism\r\nsuccessfully blocked off pain and could be used wonderfully, if only people were\r\nsufficiently enlightened, in surgery and in the treatment of fractures and injuries.\r\nHe had many anecdotes to bolster his reasoning, and after a while, when he\r\nfelt that his audience had been adequately instructed and prepared, he called for\r\nsome volunteers, so as to demonstrate before our very eyes the power of this\r\nmarvelous new science. Immediately, a half-dozen men and women, mostly\r\nyoung, left their seats in various sections of the auditorium and made their way\r\nto the stage.\r\n“The man’s a charlatan,” Father grumbled in a low voice. “His ‘volunteers’ are\r\nno more genuine than play-actors.”\r\n“So why don’t you volunteer, Father?” John suggested.\r\n“I think I’ll enjoy the show more from here, thank you.”\r\n“What about you, Owen?” John said.\r\n“No,” I said. “I’ll just watch, and make up my mind later.” I was shy about\r\nbeing seen up on a stage like that. Because of my arm, perhaps, but mainly\r\nbecause of an innate desire to blend in with the crowd and not seem showy or\r\nself-advertising. Besides, I did not particularly want to play a role in this ongoing\r\nquarrel between John and Father. It was their fight, not mine. For some years\r\nnow, John had seemed intent on converting Father to his belief in “science” and\r\n“objectivity!” which Father well knew was merely a covert way of arguing with\r\nhim about the truth of the Bible and religion. I had long since decided to keep\r\nmy apostasy as private as possible and never tried to defend it against Father’s\r\nfaith.",
    "\r\nFrom his group of volunteers, Professor Sunderland selected the most\r\nattractive person, a buxom, fair-skinned young woman with brown hair wound\r\nneatly around her head, and drew her to the center of the stage. He asked her if\r\nshe had ever been hypnotized before. She responded in the negative, and he\r\nsaid, “Excellent, excellent,” and invited her to sit down on a stool that his\r\nassistant had placed there. When she was seated, he proceeded to wave his\r\nfingers lightly before her face and then asked her to count aloud backwards from\r\nten. Before she reached five, she had ceased counting altogether and was gazing\r\ninsensibly out at the audience.\r\n“This lovely young lady,”the Professor announced, “has not left us. She hears\r\nand understands my every word. She has, however, been rendered insensible to\r\npain.”\r\n“Nonsense,”‘ Father muttered.\r\nThe Professor informed the young woman that she would not remember any of\r\nwhat was about to occur, that he would do nothing to harm her or anyone else,\r\nand he would not ask her to do or say anything that was morally repugnant to\r\nher. She gave no indication that she had heard or understood him but merely sat\r\nthere on the stool with a small smile on her lips, as if she were remembering a\r\npleasant incident from earlier in the day. She seemed quite peaceful and at rest.\r\nAt a gesture from the Professor, his assistant suddenly appeared beside him\r\nwith a lit candle. “Extend your left hand, palm to the floor, please,” the\r\nhypnotist said, and the woman instantly complied. When he brought the flame\r\nof the candle to within an inch of her palm, she showed no evidence of having\r\nfelt its heat. For a long time, he held it there, before taking it away and handing\r\nit back to his assistant, retrieving this time a bit of ice.",
    " He told the woman to\r\nturn her hand over, which she did, and he placed the ice into her hand and\r\nclosed her fingers over it. Her pleasantly calm expression and relaxed physical\r\nmanner did not change; the cold bothered her no more than had the heat.\r\nAt this point, the Professor’s assistant brought out a medium-sized anvil, an\r\nobject he carried with obvious difficulty, due to its great weight, probably some\r\nseventy-five pounds. The hypnotist hefted the anvil, then passed it to one of the\r\nsturdy young men amongst the volunteers still on the stage, and noted that the\r\nyoung man had difficulty hefting it. “Is it genuine?” he asked the fellow, who\r\ngrinned and said yes. “Our frail young woman” he said, “will handle this anvil as\r\nif it were made of paper. It will seem to her as light as a sack of feathers.”\r\nSuddenly, Father stood up and was calling out to the Professor. “Hold on\r\nthere, mister! Just hold on a minute!”\r\n“Sir?” The hypnotist was clearly startled and perhaps a little alarmed. Father’s\r\nmanner was severe, and he seemed, even to me, in a fume.\r\n“The woman is insensible to pain, you say!”\r\n“I do, indeed.”\r\n“Well, sir, I do not believe you or her! You have not sufficiently tested her, as\r\nfar as I am concerned. I believe that I can make her instantly sensible to pain, if\r\ngiven the opportunity.”\r\nProfessor Sunderland hesitated a moment, as if taking the measure of his\r\nopponent. Then he smiled politely and said, “Sir, you may yourself test the\r\nsubject. But only if you yourself are willing to undergo the same test.” The man\r\nhad met this sort of challenge before.\r\nFather, who had already moved from his seat to the aisle, stopped in his\r\ntracks. “Well, sir, I am not the one claiming to be insensible to pain. No one has\r\nwaved his fingers before me and said abra-ca-dabra.”\r\n“To be sure.",
    " But to protect my subject from injury, I must insist that you\r\nyourself endure whatever pain you wish to test her with. How do you propose to\r\ntest her, may I ask?” He smiled broadly at the audience.\r\nFather would not back down. His face reddening noticeably, he made his way\r\ndown to the front and mounted to the stage, where, to my surprise, he produced\r\nfrom his coat pocket two small vials. Then, turning to us, he announced that one\r\nof the vials contained ammonia, which he was sure would cause the girl to flinch\r\nand weep. In the other, he said, was a strong medicine known as cow-itch, which\r\nhe was sure many in the audience were familiar with, although I suspected he\r\nwas wrong on that. The ammonia alone, he said, would do the trick, and he\r\nuncorked the bottle and held it under the nose of the girl. He held it there for\r\nnearly a full minute, to be sure that she inhaled it. She made no response at all.\r\nThe crowd was delighted and applauded cheerfully.\r\n“Ah, but now, sir,” said the Professor, “you must undergo the same test.”\r\nFather said, “She may have held her breath.”\r\n“Try it again, if you wish. And hold it there as long as you like.” Again, Father\r\nheld the ammonia below the girl’s nostrils, this time for perhaps three minutes,\r\nwhile we all watched her face carefully for the slightest sign of discomfort. But it\r\nwas as if the bottle were filled with fresh spring water.\r\nProfessor Sunderland finally reached forward and took the bottle from Father\r\nand gently turned Father to face the audience. “Now, my friend, let us see if you\r\ndo indeed have ammonia here.”\r\nFather closed his eyes and faced squarely ahead. And when the Professor\r\nwaved the vial under his nose, Father jerked his head back and visibly winced.\r\nThe audience broke into loud laughter and applause.\r\n“The woman has some ability to hide her reactions to strong smell,” Father\r\nsaid.",
    " “Let me try her with the cow-itch.”\r\n“As you wish, sir,” said the hypnotist.\r\nWith the corner of his handkerchief, Father applied a swab of the stuff to the\r\ngirl’s bare neck. She did not flinch or change her expression in the slightest.\r\nFather’s shoulders sank.\r\n“Well, my friend, may we test you the same way?” said the hypnotist. “You\r\nhave the advantage of her, I notice, as a man apparently used to working\r\noutdoors in the sun.” He crooked a finger over Father’s collar and drew down his\r\nleather tie, exposing to the audience Father’s dark red neck. “May I?” he politely\r\nasked, and took the handkerchief from Father’s hand and rubbed it vigorously\r\nacross the back of Father’s neck.\r\nThe Old Man winced, but he did not otherwise reveal the awful pain that I\r\nknew he was experiencing and which was growing worse by the instant. Poor\r\nman. Along with everyone else in the audience, John was laughing loudly now,\r\nas Father struggled to maintain his compo. sure and depart from the stage as\r\nswiftly as possible. Practically at a run, he came back up the aisle and, ignoring\r\nus as he passed, kept going, straight out the door.\r\n“Should we go with him?” I whispered to John.\r\n“Naw, he’ll befine,”he said, grinning. “In a few days.”\r\nI departed from my seat then and followed the Old Man, feeling too much\r\nsympathy to leave him alone. I found him outside on the street, clawing in a\r\nfrenzy at his collar, struggling to rub the stuff out, but only succeeding in driving\r\nit deeper into his flesh. I decided to say nothing and accompanied him all the\r\nway home in silence, hanging back a few steps while he stopped at nearly every\r\nlight pole to rub the back of his neck violently against the cold metal like a poor,\r\nstricken beast. It was a pathetic and oddly moving sight, and I was as much\r\nfascinated and compelled to stare as I was embarrassed by Father’s antics.",
    " I felt\r\nashamed for looking at him. But how I enjoyed seeing Father suffer in public!\r\nAnd how, at the same time, I wished it had not happened at all.\r\nThese small stories which I have lately written out for you have drawn me back\r\nto the origins of our larger story, to the unknown parts of it, at least. And there\r\nis a particular, important book in our life as a family which you may not yet\r\nhave come upon in your research. Half a century ago, it was very popular\r\namongst the abolitionists. I have this morning retrieved it from the box of\r\nFather’s books, which, as you know, remain, along with many of his letters, in\r\nmy custody, and have been recalling the first time I read in it. The book is called\r\nAmerican Slavery as It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses. I urge you to read\r\naloud the portions of the book which I will copy out here below, so that you will\r\nhave a more exact idea of how it was for us. We were seated around the fire in\r\nthe kitchen fireplace of the old Haymaker Place in Hudson, Ohio, where we then\r\nlived. Father opened it to the first page and, with his voice very loud,\r\ncommenced to read from it. After he had read for several moments, he passed\r\nthe book to us and bade each in turn to read from it.\r\nFirst, my stepmother Mary read, haltingly and sometimes stumbling over\r\nunfamiliar words, for she was not a skillful reader. Then my brother John, who\r\nwas eighteen years of age that winter, rapidly read a page or two. And after him,\r\nJason, who was seventeen, in a voice that was almost a whisper, took his place.\r\nFinally, the book came to me, and I began to read.\r\nWe will, in the first place, prove by a cloud of witnesses that the slaves are\r\nwhipped with such inhuman severity as to lacerate and mangle their flesh in the\r\nmost shocking manner, leaving permanent scars and ridges.",
    " After establishing\r\nthis, we will present a mass of testimony confirming a great variety of other\r\ntortures. The testimony, for the most part, will he that of the slaveholders\r\nthemselves, and in their own chosen words. A large portion of it will he taken\r\nfrom the advertisements, which they have published in their own newspapers,\r\ndescribing their runaway slaves by the scars on their bodies made by the whip.\r\nTo copy these advertisements entire would require a great amount of space and\r\nflood the reader with a vast mass of matter irrelevant to the point before us; we\r\nshall therefore insert only so much of each as will intelligibly set forth the\r\nprecise point under consideration. In the column following the word “WITNESS”\r\nwill be found the name of the individual, his place of residence, and the name\r\nand date of the paper in which it appeared, and generally the place where it\r\nwas published. Following the identification of each witness will be an extract\r\nfrom the advertisement containing his or her TESTIMONY....\r\nI stopped and looked up at Father, expecting him to reach forward for the\r\nbook. But he merely nodded for me to go on, and so I obeyed.\r\nWITNESS: Mr. D. Judd, jailor, Davidson Co., Tenn., in the “Nashville\r\nBanner” Dec. 10,1838.

    "”\r\nHere, with trembling hand, I delivered the book across to Father, who\r\nthroughout had sat peering somberly into the fire that blazed in the great open\r\nfireplace. He brought the book near to his face, as he customarily did, and in his\r\nreedy voice continued where I had left off.\r\nThe slaves are often branded with hot irons, pursued with firearms and shot,\r\nhunted with dogs and torn by them, shockingly maimed with knives,\r\ndirks,&C.;have their ears cut off, their eyes knocked out, their hones dislocated\r\nand broken with bludgeons, their fingers and toes cut off, their faces and other\r\nparts of their persons disfigured with scars and gashes, besides those made with\r\nthe lash.\r\nWe shall adopt, under this head, the same course as that pursued under\r\nprevious ones—first give the testimony of the slaveholders themselves to the\r\nmutilations &c, by copying their own graphic descriptions of them in\r\nadvertisements published under their own names and in newspapers published in\r\nthe slave states and, generally, in their own immediate vicinity. We shall, as\r\nheretofore, insert only so much of each advertisement as will be necessary to\r\nmake the point intelligible.\r\nFather ceased to read, and we five sat for a moment in silence. All the younger\r\nchildren were long asleep in the rooms above. Then Father passed the book, still\r\nopen at the page where he had left off, over to me, and falling into the antique\r\nmanner of speech that he sometimes used, especially when overcome by\r\nemotion, he said, “Owen, thou hast still at times the voice of a child. Read these\r\nwords, so that we may better hear in thy innocent voice their terrible, indicting\r\nevil.”\r\nNot fully understanding, I nonetheless obeyed, and read on.\r\nWITNESS: Mr. Micajah Kicks, Nash Co., N.C., in the Raleigh “Standard,”\r\nJuly 18,1838.",

TESTIMONY: “Ranaway, my negro man named Simon; he has\r\nbeen shot badly in the back and right arm.”\r\nLong into the winter night I read, my voice breaking like glass at times, as it\r\ndid then naturally, due to my youth, but more particularly because of the\r\nhorrors that loomed before my eyes. My breath caught in my throat, my eyes\r\nwatered over, my hands trembled, and it seemed that I could not go on saying\r\nthe words that described such incredible cruelties. Yet I continued. It was as if I\r\nwere merely the voice for all five of us seated together in that candlelit room\r\nbefore the fire, and we were together very like a single person—Father, Mary,\r\nJohn, Jason, and I, bound together by a vision of the charnel house of Negro\r\nslavery.\r\nI said the words on the page before me, but I felt situated outside myself,\r\nhuddled with the others, listening with them to the broken voice of a white boy\r\nreading from a terrible book in a farmhouse kitchen in the old Western Reserve\r\nof Ohio. Those cold, calm accounts from newspapers, those mild and\r\ndispassionate descriptions of floggings, torture, and maimings, of families torn\r\nasunder, of husbands sold off from wives, of children yanked from their mother’s\r\narms, of human beings treated as no rational man would treat his beasts of\r\nburden—they dissolved the differences of age and sex and temperament that\r\nseparated the five of us into our individual selves and then welded us together as\r\nnothing before ever had.",
    " Not the deaths of infant children, not the long years of\r\ndebt and poverty, not our religion, not our labor in the fields, not even the death\r\nof my mother, had so united us as our hushed reading, hour after hour, of that\r\nlitany of suffering.\r\nIn my lifetime up to that point and for many years before, despite our earnest\r\ndesires, especially Father’s, all that we had shared as a family—birth, death,\r\npoverty, religion, and work—had proved incapable of making our blood ties\r\nmystical and transcendent. It took the sudden, unexpected sharing of a vision of\r\nthe fate of our Negro brethren to do it. And though many times prior to that\r\nwinter night we had obtained glimpses of their fate, through pamphlets and\r\npublications of the various anti-slavery societies and from the personal\r\ntestimonies given at abolitionist meetings by Negro men and women who had\r\nthemselves been slaves or by white people who had traveled into the stronghold\r\nof slavery and had witnessed firsthand the nature of the beast, we had never\r\nbefore seen it with such long clarity ourselves, stared at it as if the beast itself\r\nwere here in our kitchen, writhing before us.\r\nWe saw it at once, and we saw it together, and we saw it for a long time. The\r\nvision was like a flame that melted us, and afterwards, when it finally cooled, we\r\nhad been hardened into a new and unexpected shape. We had been re-cast as a\r\nsingle entity, and each one of us had been forged and hammered into an\r\ninseparable part of the whole.\r\nAt last, after I had recited the irrefutable and terrifyingly detailed rebuttals to\r\nthe slavers’ objections to the abolition of slavery—with Objection III,\r\n“Slaveholders Are Proverbial for Their Kindness, Hospitality, Benevolence, and\r\nGenerosity”—I saw that I had come to the end of Testimony of a Thousand\r\nWitnesses. I closed the book on my lap.",
    " I remember that for a long time we\r\nremained silent.\r\nThen slowly Father got up from his chair and placed a fresh log on the dying\r\nfire and stayed there, his back to us, his hands hanging loosely at his sides, and\r\nwatched the flames blaze up. Without turning, he began to speak. He was at first\r\ncalm and deliberate in speech, as was his habit, but gradually he warmed to the\r\nsubject and began to sputter loudly, as he often did when excited by the\r\nmeaning and implications of his words.\r\nHe reminded us of an event some two years past, when, in this same month of\r\nNovember, on learning of the assassination, in Alton, Illinois, of that holy man\r\nElijah Lovejoy, Father had publically pledged his life to the overthrow of slavery.\r\nWe all knew this. He had done it in church, and we and our neighbors had\r\nwitnessed his pledge, and so had the Lord, who sees everything, Father declared.\r\nAnd we and the Lord had also seen that, since then, just as he had done all the\r\nlong years of his life before making that pledge, Father had continued to be a\r\nweak and despicable man.\r\nWe said no, but he said yes and waved us off. The truth was that he had not\r\nmade himself into the implacable foe of this crime against God and man which\r\nhe had sworn publically to oppose. Then he said, “My children, the years of my\r\nlife are passing swiftly.” He fisted his hands and placed them before his eyes like\r\na child about to weep. He said that while he had been idling selfishly and in\r\nsinful distraction, lured by his vanity and by pathetic dreams of wealth and\r\nfame, the slavers had dug in deeper all across the Southern states. They had\r\nspread out like foetid waters, flooding over the plains into Texas and the\r\nterritories.",
    " They had steadily entrenched themselves in positions of power in\r\nWashington, until now the poor slaves could no longer even raise their voices to\r\ncry for help without being slain for it or being swiftly sold off into Alabama and\r\nMississippi. Black heroes, and now and again a white man like Lovejoy, had\r\nrisen in our midst and were everywhere being persecuted and even executed for\r\ntheir heroism, legally, by the people of these United States.\r\n“My children,” he said, “it’s mobs that rule us now. And all the while Mister\r\nGarrison and his anti-slavery socialites bray and pray and keep their soft, pink\r\nhands clean. Politicians keep on politicking. For the businessmen it’s business as\r\nusual: ‘Sell us your cheap cotton, we’ll sell you back iron chains for binding the\r\nslaves who pick it.’”\r\nFather then cursed them; he cursed them all. And he cursed himself. For his\r\nweakness and his vanity, he said, “I curse myself”\r\nHe turned to us and now crossed his arms over his chest. His face was like a\r\nmask carved of wood by an Indian sachem. His eyes gazed sadly down at us\r\nthrough holes in the mask. It was the face of a man who had been gazing at\r\nfires, who had roused the attendants of the fires, serpents and demons hissing\r\nback at the man who had dared to swing open the iron door and peer inside. We\r\nall knew what Father had seen there. We had seen it, too. But he, due to his\r\nnature and characteristic desire, had gazed overlong and with too great a\r\ndirectness, and his gray eyes had been scorched by the sight.\r\nI was a boy; I was frightened by my father’s face. I remember recoiling from\r\nhim, as if he himself were one of the guardian serpents. I remember Father\r\nlooking straight into our eyes, burning us with his gaze, as he told us to hear him\r\nnow. He had determined that he would henceforth put his sins of pride and\r\nvanity behind him.",
    " And he would go out from here and wage war on slavery.\r\nThe time has come, he declared, and he wished to join the time in full cry. “And\r\nI mean to make war by force and arms!” he said. “Not such weak-kneed war as\r\nMister Garrison is determined to make, he and that crowd of Boston, parlor-\r\npolite abolitionists. I mean to make the sort of war that was waged by the great\r\nNegroes, Cinque, Nat Turner, and L’Ouverture, and by the Roman slave\r\nSpartacus. I mean to make war in which the enemy is known and strictly named\r\nas such and is slain for his enmity to our cause.”\r\nHe called us his children, even Mary, and said that the time for talk was past.\r\nThe time for seeking the abolition of slavery by means of negotiations with Satan\r\nhad always been long past. There never was such a time. Therefore, before us,\r\nhis beloved family, before his wife and sons, and before God, he was making\r\ntonight his sacred pledge.\r\nHere Father explained what we already knew, that he had long entertained\r\nsuch a purpose anyhow, despite his slackness and distraction, but that he now\r\nbelieved it was his duty, the utmost duty of his life, to devote himself to this\r\npurpose, and he wished us fully to understand this duty and its implications.\r\nThen, after spending considerable time in setting forth in most impressive\r\nlanguage the hopeless and hideous condition of the slave, much of the details\r\nborrowed from our just-completed reading of Mr. Weld’s American Slavery as It\r\nIs, Father seemed to have finished his declaration, when suddenly he asked us,\r\n“Which of you is willing to make common cause with me?” He looked from one\r\nface to the next. “Which of you, I want to know, is willing to do everything in\r\nyour power to break the jaws of the wicked and pluck the spoil from Satan’s\r\nteeth?” He put the question to us one by one. “Are you, Mary? John? Jason?\r\nOwen?",
    "”\r\nMy stepmother, my elder brothers, and I, we each of us in turn softly answered\r\nyes.\r\nWhereupon Father kneeled down in prayer and bade us to do likewise. This\r\nposition in prayer impressed me greatly, I remember, as it was the first time I\r\nhad ever known him to assume it, for normally he remained standing in prayer,\r\nwith his hands grasping a chair-back and his head merely lowered.\r\nWhen he had finished the prayer, which was for guidance and protection in\r\nour new task, he stood, as did we, and he asked us to raise our right hands to\r\nhim. He then administered to us an oath, which bound us to secrecy and total\r\ndevotion to the purpose of fighting slavery by force and arms to the extent of our\r\nability.\r\n“We have thus now begun to wage war!” he declared. Although it seemed to\r\nme then, as it does now, so many years later, that he had already begun his war\r\nagainst slavery numerous times before this, here he was, in a sense beginning it\r\nagain. And although I did not know it on that particular night, he would find\r\nhimself obliged to bind himself to this sacred purpose many more times in the\r\nfuture as well. Father’s repeated declarations of war against slavery, and his\r\nasking us to witness them, were his ongoing pronouncement of his lifelong\r\nintention and desire. It was how he renewed and created his future.\r\nTonight, however, was significantly different. This was the first time that he\r\nhad determined forthrightly to take up arms and wage war by force. Also, and\r\nmore importantly, perhaps, it was the first time that I myself was a part of his\r\npledge, that we all were sworn together, bound by our war on slavery to see the\r\nend of it, or of us. The overthrow of slavery was no longer Father’s private\r\nobsession. I had allowed him to make it mine as well.",
    "\r\nChapter 3\r\nThere is something that I have always wanted to explain, because in the various\r\nconsiderations of Father’s lifelong commitment to the overthrow of slavery, it\r\nhas been much misunderstood. A great but little noted problem faced by Father\r\nthroughout his life was his constantly divided mind. This division arose because,\r\nas much as he wished to be a warrior against slavery, he also wished to be, like\r\nmost Americans, a man of means.\r\nTo be fair, it was a more basic and praiseworthy need than that. He had a\r\nlarge family, after all, and merely to house and feed and clothe them required\r\nenormous, sustained effort, especially if his only sources of income were his farm\r\nand his tannery. And by the time he had reached his mid-thirties, he was\r\nbeginning to fear that, because of this requirement, he would always be a poor\r\nman with no time to wage war against slavery. His poverty, therefore, sabotaged\r\nhis moral life. That is how it seemed to him. And that is what eventually led him\r\ndown a path that very nearly did indeed sabotage his moral life.\r\nDespite his having been poor and struggling since childhood, the Old Man\r\nhimself dated the onset of his true financial woes to his thirty-ninth year, to the\r\nperiod of what he called his “extreme calamity.” Father always believed that\r\nthere were three ways to make money in America: manufacturing or growing\r\nthings; buying things low; and selling things high. A man who did only one of\r\nthese would forever remain poor. He had to do at least two of them: best if he\r\ndid all three, but without capital to invest in large-scale manufacture,\r\nimpossible. A farmer made things, as it were, and sold them; a tanner did the\r\nsame.",
    " Father had tried making and selling for nearly two decades, but he was\r\nstill poor and exhausted: the process of manufacturing food, livestock, or leather\r\ngoods took too long and consumed all a man’s days and nights, and thus he\r\nwould never in his lifetime accumulate sufficient capital to manufacture steel,\r\nfor instance, or some other item of great cost where the margins of profit were\r\nlarge enough to enrich him in his own time. He might turn to buying low and\r\nselling high, then. And what could be easily bought and rapidly sold by a man\r\nwith little or no capital? Land. Hundreds of thousands, millions, of acres of\r\nloamy land rolling west from the Alleghenies all the way to the Mississippi and\r\nbeyond. There was no greater or cheaper material resource available to an Ohio\r\nman in those days.\r\nInexpensive, arable land—it lay for miles all around him, and every month\r\nnew immigrants from the crowded New England states and the eastern seaboard\r\ncities and even parts of Europe were pouring into the Western Reserve, bringing\r\nwith them an insatiable hunger for farmland. They would also need new roads\r\nand canals to ship their produce east, new settlements and villages to reside and\r\ndo business in, new schools and churches and public buildings to accommodate\r\ntheir expanding society. But before all else, they needed land, for they were\r\nmostly small farmers and young, and they brought with them or could easily\r\nborrow the necessary cash to buy it with. And in those years the bankers were\r\neager to loan money with little or no collateral to secure it, for they well\r\nunderstood that a man who did not need that land for his own use, if he\r\nborrowed enough money to buy it first, could turn around and sell it for a higher\r\nprice tomorrow, could pocket the difference, borrow more and buy more and sell\r\nthat, too.",
    "\r\nBasically, that was how Father fell into debt—by following the advice of bankers\r\n—and afterwards no amount of time and energy spent at war against the slavers,\r\nno amount of preaching to his neighbors, and no amount of training and\r\nconditioning his large family to become an army for the Lord could keep his\r\nmind free of his terrible indebtedness. Thus his divided mind.\r\nIt was very complicated, how Father first got himself into debt and then\r\nproceeded to worsen his situation permanently, and as I was but a boy in my\r\nearly and middle teens then, I did not much understand it. Besides, it was not\r\nthen or ever Father’s way to provide people with the details of his business\r\nmatters, so that most of what I know I learned years later and gleaned from\r\nothers. He could not keep everything from us, of course. Especially since we, his\r\nfamily, had so often to cover for him and over time were called upon to make so\r\nmany material sacrifices that were a direct result of the Old Man’s schemes. But I\r\ndo not think that anyone—family member, friend, or business associate, or even\r\nFather’s own lawyers, when later he was suing and being sued—knew all the\r\nfacts of his financial dealings. He tended to give out partial or contradictory\r\ninformation and sometimes even false information, all designed, or so it seemed,\r\nto keep his interrogator from asking further questions, as if somewhere at the\r\nbottom there were a secret fraud, when in fact there was none—it was only\r\nFather who was being fooled, and for the most part fooled by himself. He was\r\ndeceived by his desires, actually, which is why, when it all came crashing down\r\non his head, he blamed his own greed and vanity.\r\nEarly on, his secrecy had sprung from an ingrained sense of decorum and\r\ndesire for privacy.",
    " Then for many years, when he was in flight from bankruptcy\r\nand, later, from the consequences of bankruptcy itself, he probably felt that\r\nsecrecy was necessary to protect his family and business associates. “A man who\r\nis wholly candid about his finances, who opens his ledgers to anyone who asks,\r\nsuch a man abandons his responsibility to Others,”Father insisted, although he\r\nhad arrived at this philosophy by a somewhat circuitous route. It served him\r\nwell in the end, however, and others also. After Kansas and Harpers Ferry—\r\nwhen what had originally been Yankee manners, and then self-interested\r\nnecessity, had become military policy—these habits of secrecy and occasional\r\ndissembling protected many of the people who were his chief supporters, and\r\nthey may well have even saved the lives of some good men, like Frederick\r\nDouglass and Dr. Howe and Frank Sanborn.\r\nIt started back in the middle ’30s, after Father had closed down his tannery in\r\nNew Richmond and returned to Hudson, Ohio, where, like so many other men of\r\nsmall money and big ideas, he got drawn into buying land and farms on easy\r\ncredit and unsecured loans. Of course, with hindsight one can say that it was\r\ninevitable and hardly inexplicable, and having found himself dangerously\r\noverextended, he should simply have cut his losses and gotten out. But the Old\r\nMan, once he had determined that optimism was realism, could not be shaken\r\nfrom his course. After all, just take a look around, he would say in those early\r\ndays of the land boom. All over the Western Reserve, men clearly less intelligent\r\nand hard-working than he were getting fabulously rich. Why not jump in\r\nhimself? And why not bring in friends and family, too? Share the coming\r\nharvest.\r\nAt first, however, and for a long time, he successfully resisted the temptation\r\nto join the general run to speculate on land with borrowed money.",
    " That was\r\nwhen optimism was not realism; it was fantasy, or worse. He saw it then as a\r\nsickness, the mentality of a stampeding herd. And he justified his resistance,\r\ntypically, on moral grounds, on principle, fortified by the Bible. As in\r\nDeuteronomy 15:6: Thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow.\r\nAs in Proverbs 22:7: Therichruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the\r\nlender.\r\nLater, when he began to borrow, it was on principle then, too. He borrowed\r\neverywhere from everyone—from his father and brothers in Akron, from rich\r\nmen and poor, banks, friends, and strangers. He had a well-deserved reputation\r\nfor probity and honesty, and so great was his belief in his ability to take the\r\nmeasure of land (a not altogether unfounded belief: though self-taught, he was a\r\nskillful surveyor and possessed a sensitive, knowing eye for good farmland) and\r\nso attractive a talker was he that, once he set his mind to make a purchase, it\r\nwas not difficult for him to convince others to become his partners and to loan\r\nhim the money for his share of the partnership as well. From this side of the\r\nfence, however, he took to citing Luke 14: 28-30—the story of the man who\r\ntried to build a tower and did not have sufficient material to finish it and was\r\nmocked by his neighbors. And 2 Kings 6:4-6—the story of the borrowed iron\r\naxe-head that fell into the water and was made to float and was not lost. And\r\nalso, from 2 Kings 4:1-7—the story of Elisha’s widowed daughter-in-law, whose\r\nsons were taken in bond by her creditors, so she borrowed many vessels from\r\nher neighbors, and the vessels were made to fill with oil, which were then sold\r\nto pay all her debts, even that for the borrowed vessels, freeing her sons and\r\nleaving the rest for her and her sons to live luxuriously on afterwards.",
    "\r\nSadly, Father’s Bible failed to warn him that the newly elected President,\r\nMartin Van Buren, would abruptly establish the National Bank and change the\r\nlending rules, causing the famous Panic of ’37. Thanks to Van Buren’s National\r\nBank, soon all the small-monied borrowing men like Father were left holding\r\npackets of worthless paperpiles of currency issued by the various states and high\r\nmountains of mortgaged titles to vast tracts of western land and farms that could\r\nbe neither sold for one-tenth their costs nor rented for the interest due on the\r\nunsecured loans that had purchased them barely a year before. The lucky fellows\r\nand the bankers and politicians who understood the system and thus had been\r\nable to anticipate the sudden deflation of value that inevitably follows hard upon\r\na speculative boom, those men sold off their properties early and high and\r\nwalked away counting their profits. Within weeks, they were doing the\r\nPresident’s bidding, calling in their neighbors’ loans and hiring sheriffs to seize\r\nland, houses, livestock, and even the personal property of the foolishly stubborn\r\nmen who persisted in believing that the decline was only a temporary\r\naberration. For those men, men like John Brown, surveyor, tanner, and small-\r\ntime stockman, the collapse of the land boom was catastrophic.",
    "\r\nThus, by the summer of ’39, Father—who two years earlier had thought\r\nhimself practically an Ohio land baron, who in his mind had laid out an entire\r\ntown on five thousand mortgaged acres overlooking the Cuyahoga River, where\r\nhe expected soon to see a government-financed canal that would be as enriching\r\nto him as the Erie had been to developers in western New York; a penniless man\r\nwho owned title to two mortgaged farms he did not live on and one, the\r\nHaymaker Place, that he loved and hoped to make his family estate one day; a\r\none-time tanner of hides raising thoroughbred horses and blooded Saxony sheep,\r\nwho rode about like a squire in a carriage behind a matched pair of gray\r\nNarragansetts, all this on borrowed money—that man suddenly, inexplicably,\r\nfound himself hounded by bondsmen, banks, process-servers, and sheriffs.\r\nBound as much by principle and Biblical text as when he had stayed out,\r\nFather with foolish consistency covered his borrowings with more borrowing\r\nand dropped deeper and deeper into debt. In ‘37 and ‘38, with everyone else\r\nrushing to sell short and salvage what little property he could, Father, almost\r\nalone, refused to get out. “This too shall pass, children, this too shall pass,” he\r\nwould say. “We must be patient.” But all his promissory notes, which had been\r\npiled on top of one another even higher than any of us had imagined, were\r\ncoming due. One by one, his titles began to be seized, titles that he had used to\r\nguarantee second loans, which afterwards he had used for the purchase of still\r\nother properties, until finally it began to look as though he would lose all his\r\nplots of land, his canal-side properties, also his carriage and Narragansetts and\r\nthe blooded stock.",
    " Even the house we lived in, the Haymaker Place, was under\r\nsiege, the sweet little farmstead that we older boys and Mary, sister Ruth, and\r\nthe younger children had been managing well enough to keep the family\r\nadequately fed and clothed, while Father raced around the countryside\r\nfrantically trying to keep his paper empire from being blown utterly away.\r\nHe was in those days more frightened than I had ever seen him before or\r\nafterwards. The growing violence of his words alarmed all who heard him,\r\nespecially Mary and us children. The more frantic and frightened he became, the\r\nmore reliant on his Bible for guidance and on his moral force for instruction he\r\nbecame, but now his discourse was a tangle of contradictory quotations and\r\nmaxims that even he could not unravel. “This prolonged tribulation, if it be the\r\nwill of Providence, must be endured with cheerfulness and true resignation,” he\r\ninstructed us. “We must try to trust in Him who is very gracious and full of\r\ncompassion and of almighty power, for those that do not will be made ashamed.\r\nWe must not be ashamed, children! Remember that Ezra, the prophet, when\r\nhimself and the capitivity were in a strait, prayed and afflicted himself before\r\nGod. So must we go and do likewise.”\r\nThus, though we had come to dread the announcement of any new scheme or\r\nplan to make money and at last turn things around, it was with barely concealed\r\nrelief that we greeted his decision to round up a herd of miscellaneous cattle\r\nfrom all over the county and drive it east to Connecticut, where there was a\r\nready, cash-paying market operated by the agency of Wadsworth & Wells, a\r\ncompany that Father had dealt with successfully in the past.",
    " In short order, he\r\nmanaged to put together a sizeable herd of cows owned mostly by Grandfather\r\nand several of Father’s friends, with seventeen head of our own, all but our last\r\ntwo milch cows. He drove his cattle aboard the barge at Ashtabula, and we\r\nwaved him off and, when he was out of sight, happily embraced one another,\r\nglad to see him gone from us for a while, so that we could re-gather our wits and\r\nreclaim a shared sense of reality.\r\nWhen he went east in ’39, Father’s real plan, which he did not reveal to those\r\nwho had entrusted him with their cattle, was not merely to raise cash by selling\r\nlivestock to Wadsworth & Wells, but also while there to negotiate still further\r\nloans in New York or, if necessary, up in Boston, to cover his growing losses\r\nback in Ohio. It took him only a few days to fail in New York; bankers there had\r\nalready withdrawn all speculative loans from the Western Reserve and were not\r\nabout to risk more. Directly, he went on to tap the more deeply rooted money\r\ntrees in Boston, and when he returned to complete his cattle-dealing in Hartford,\r\nalthough lugging an empty bucket, he was once again brightly optimistic. He\r\nnever said who, but someone up there had allowed Father to believe that within\r\na few days, a week at the most, of his return to Hartford, he would receive an\r\nunsecured loan of five thousand dollars. I suspect his supposed benefactor was a\r\nwealthy abolitionist like Mr. Stearns or even Dr. Howe, whose wife, the poet,\r\nwas rumored to be an heiress, but it might have been a Yankee banker still\r\nlooking to extract titles to western lands from a bumpkin in need, a rich man\r\nonly temporarily deluded as to his own best interests by Father’s enthusiasm,\r\nnaïveté, and evident honesty.\r\nFive thousand dollars. The figure is important.",
    " This was the amount for which\r\nFather had recently been sued by the Western Reserve Bank of Warren, Ohio, for\r\nhaving defaulted on several loans. Judgement had been found against him, and\r\nunable to pay even a portion of the debt, he was being threatened with outright\r\nbankruptcy or jail. At the last minute, an old friend from Akron, Mr. Amos\r\nChamberlain, had kindly taken over the note for him. To guarantee that loan, the\r\nOld Man had written Mr. Chamberlain a note against the Haymaker farm. What\r\nhe did not tell Mr. Chamberlain or the Western Reserve Bank was that the\r\nHaymaker title had earlier been used to guarantee any number of additional\r\nloans of money for the purchase of other large plots of land along the Cuyahoga\r\nRiver. It had been done pursuant to the digging of the proposed Ohio-to-\r\nPittsburgh canal, which, unfortunately, had ended up going in further west, near\r\nCleveland. It was another of his schemes gone bad, still unpaid, and one of the\r\nbottom cards in Father’s shaky house of cards.\r\nA few days passed, and no money arrived from Boston. A week. Then another.\r\nEvery few hours, Father walked from the office of Wadsworth & Wells, which he\r\nwas using as his headquarters, to the post office, only to return empty-handed,\r\npuzzled, increasingly angered, and very frightened. At best, he would lose\r\neverything: the farm and livestock, the house and all its furnishings—everything!\r\nHow would he feed his poor babies? How could he face his family and friends?\r\nThen sometime during the afternoon of June 14, 1839, Mr. Wadsworth went into\r\nthe office of his company and discovered that the sum of five thousand dollars\r\nhad been removed from the cash box. As the box was undamaged and still\r\nlocked, he knew at once who had taken it. Besides Mr. Wadsworth and Mr.",
    "\r\nWells, only Father, their trusted agent, who might now and then need a few\r\ndollars in order to help conduct their business, had a key.\r\nI do not know what my father was thinking while he stood that day in the\r\nempty office, counting out the money. He could not possibly have gotten away\r\nwith it. And the betrayal! He was almost a partner, a trusted confidant of Messrs.\r\nWadsworth and Wells, their reliable procurer of western cattle, one of the most\r\nknowledgeable and honest stockmen they had ever worked with. He must have\r\nfelt like a child who has long protected one lie with another and has woven an\r\nentire fabric of lies, laying one strand atop and under the other, and has come\r\neventually to long for the truth to stand revealed, not because he loves the truth,\r\nbut because exposure will bring an end to the agonizing labor of weaving a\r\nworld of falsehoods. To get it over with, simply to make sense of his daily life,\r\nthe child finally tells an utterly outrageous lie, one that cannot be believed. With\r\na single lie, he overthrows the entire false world and reinstates the true. The\r\ntheft from Wadsworth & Wells was like that, for nothing Father could say to\r\nexplain it would be believed by them, and for a single moment, as he reached\r\ninto the cash box and counted out the five thousand dollars, Father must have\r\nbeen that child. He closed the box and placed it back inside the cabinet and\r\nlocked both.\r\nAt once, he sent the money off to his friend Mr. Chamberlain in Ohio, who\r\nwould on receipt of it relinquish back to Father the title of the Haymaker Place.\r\nAll was well again. Until, of course, later that evening, when Messrs. Wadsworth\r\nand Wells both presented themselves at the door of Father’s room at his\r\nLawrence Street boarding house.",
    " When they knocked, Father, in what he\r\nregarded as a remarkable coincidence, as if the Lord were introducing him back\r\nto himself, happened to be reading in his Bible, John, Chapter 10: He that\r\nentereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same\r\nis a thief and a robber.\r\nMr. Wadsworth and Mr. Wells said that they had come to his chamber, not to\r\naccuse Mr. Brown of theft, but simply to ask into his use of the five thousand\r\ndollars. They thought that he must have needed it to make a large purchase for\r\nthem, and they wished to know what it was.\r\nHe did not lie; he could not; he told them straight out: he had taken it for his\r\nown use. But it was only a temporary removal, he insisted, for he fully expected\r\nto receive the same amount in hours or, at the most, days, from a party up in\r\nBoston. This was true enough. And had he not at the same time believed that he\r\nwas owed that much and more by Wadsworth & Wells, he said, money owed for\r\nthe eventual sale of the cattle he had delivered to them from the west, he would\r\nhave felt considerable anguish and remorse for having removed the money\r\nprematurely. But while he was truly ashamed of having gotten himself into a\r\nsituation whereby he needed the money desperately and at once, he felt on the\r\nother hand no shame for having actually taken the money, no guilt.\r\nNow, though he no longer owed five thousand dollars to his old friend Amos\r\nChamberlain, he owed it instead to Wadsworth & Wells, who, with some\r\njustification, felt that while they may not have been exactly robbed of it, neither\r\nhad they willingly loaned it.",
    " At that awful moment of his discovery, seated\r\nbefore his stern, skeptical discoverers, the Old Man had no choice but to comply\r\nwith their demand that he sign over to them, contingent upon his return of their\r\nfive thousand dollars, the one remaining property in his name, his beloved\r\nHaymaker Place, which sheltered his wife and children.\r\nMeanwhile, the expected money from the mystery loaner in Boston did not\r\nmaterialize. I suspect that it had never been more than a mild promise merely to\r\nconsider his request, but the Old Man, when he wanted, could make a polite\r\nrejection seem its opposite. They waited a week more, and finally Mr.\r\nWadsworth declared that he and Mr. Wells would hold whatever monies they\r\ngot for selling the herd of cattle against his eventual repayment of the money he\r\nowed them or until the sale of the Haymaker property. They had no way of\r\nknowing the true value of the farm, of course, or whether it had any prior liens\r\non it, so they simply used the cattle as collateral. And they told him that,\r\nregretfully, they would no longer be able to rely on him as their western agent.\r\nAt that point, Father had no choice but to leave Hartford and make his somber\r\nway homeward. Thus he returned to us a humiliated man and poorer by far than\r\nwhen he had left to put his affairs at last in good order. Poorer, more desperate,\r\nand deeper in debt than ever, this time to men who, unlike Mr. Chamberlain,\r\nunlike Grandfather and our other relatives, friends, and neighbors back in Ohio,\r\nhad no particular interest in protecting John Brown and his family. There was\r\nnothing for it then but a steady worsening of his affairs. Like Napoleon in Russia,\r\nhe had advanced too far beyond his meager resources, so that he could no longer\r\nretreat back to a safe base, there to wait out the winter storms.",
    " Instead, he\r\nwould have to slog and thrash his way forward, a blind man in a blizzard. And\r\nso he did for the rest of his life, dragging us along behind.\r\nBack in Hudson, like a man switching a single pea beneath three shells, the Old\r\nMan managed to forestall disaster and hold on to the Haymaker Place a while\r\nlonger, until the following year, the summer of ’40. After much legal wrangling\r\nand suits and counter-suits leading all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court, a\r\nfinal judgement had been found. Bankruptcy was unavoidable. This time, all\r\nFather’s debts were being called in, and his beloved old Haymaker Place had at\r\nlast to be abandoned.\r\nTo his further horror, the original lien against the place had been called in by\r\nthe bank and sold at auction, with Mr. Amos Chamberlain the eventual buyer,\r\nand the proceeds from the sale, once Father’s loans from the bank were covered,\r\nwere to be paid against the sum owed Wadsworth & Wells. Mr. Chamberlain, in\r\nwhat Father saw as an unforgiveable betrayal, had managed to find the cash to\r\noffer the bank eight thousand five hundred dollars for the place. “If the man had\r\nthat sort of money’ Father fumed, “he might’ve loaned it to me and let me keep\r\nthe farm, so that I might feed my family!”\r\nBlinded by his anger, Father was unable to accept the reality of the situation.\r\nHe refused to turn the farm over to Mr. Chamberlain, and as a consequence, one\r\nwarm day the county sheriff and his deputies came out to the farm to put us off\r\nit. The Old Man viewed the Haymaker Place as his last stand. “I need this farm! I\r\nmust hold it and work here, if I’m ever going to provide my creditors with their\r\njust due,” he insisted.",
    " In recent months, he had abandoned all vain fantasies of\r\nspinning gold from straw and had wisely resumed tanning hides on the property,\r\nhis most reliable means of support over the years, where his labor and skills and\r\nthose of his sons were sufficient to turn a small profit. Thus he had come to\r\nimagine for the first time in years a realistic way of slowly working himself out\r\nof debt, one hard-earned dollar at a time. But he needed the house and its\r\noutbuildings and the stands of shagbark hickory that surrounded the farm in\r\norder to accomplish it.\r\nThe prospect of losing the place put him into a mindless frenzy. “Boys, we will\r\nfight them to the death! A man must defend his property!” he declared to us that\r\nJune morning. “It’s an old story. If it can be made merely to appear that Naboth\r\nthe Jezreelite has blasphemed God and the King, then it will be perfectly right\r\nand good for Ahab to possess his vineyard! So reasoned wicked men against\r\nNaboth thousands of years ago, boys, and so they reason against me today!”\r\nWe were all at midday dinner in the house, Oliver but a baby then, the kitchen\r\nfull of babies, it seemed—Charles, who would die in the terrible winter of ’43,\r\nand Salmon and Watson, and little Sarah, who was six and who would also die\r\nin that winter of ’43. Fred, then a sweetly meditative child with none of his later\r\nturbulence, was nine; Ruth was but eleven and already performing the labors of\r\na grown woman; and there was I, at sixteen, like a large, housebound dog,\r\nsimple-mindedly excited by the loud, rough noise of Father’s voice; and Jason,\r\ntwo years older, silently observing, placid, skeptical but loyal; and John, the\r\neldest, eager to display his superior understanding of the situation and his\r\nwillingness to stand fast with the Old Man.\r\nFather’s voice cracked and split in the fire of his feelings.",
    " “I warned them, I\r\ntold them this morning at the bank, warned them straight out. I told them that I\r\nwould shoot down their agents, if they came to take my home and land from me,\r\nand I swear, that’s exactly what I will do! I wanted peace, but this . .. this Ahab”\r\nhe spat, “will not let me have it!”\r\nMary—I think of her now, but I did not think of her then—poor, distressed\r\nMary, with all her small children to tend to, while her husband raged and his\r\nelder sons urged him on, must have desired then, as so many times before and\r\nlater, all the way to the terrifying end days in Virginia, just to be rid of men\r\naltogether. She knew better than any of us that there was no way for our family\r\nto survive these difficult times except by means of patient, quiet application of\r\nour daily labors, and while the Old Man appeared often to agree, when he\r\nbecame frustrated or frightened he could not keep his anger or his fantasies\r\nleashed. And we older boys took our lessons from him.\r\nFather loaded his musket and instructed John, Jason, and me to do the same.\r\nThen we four marched from the house down to the town road, where there was\r\nat the edge of the property an old, low log cabin built by the original Haymaker,\r\nwhich we used now as a storage shed for hickory bark and lumber. “Here we\r\nshall make our stand,” he pronounced, and commanded us to spend our time\r\nfortifying the structure with whatever boards and timbers there were lying\r\naround. He had work at the tannery and at the house yet to finish, he said, and\r\nwould protect the property from there. He ordered us to stay at the cabin night\r\nand day. Ruth or he himself would bring us food and fresh clothing. “And if the\r\nrascals show their faces, boys, fire once into the air to signal me, and I’ll come a-\r\nrunning. They’ll see then that we are serious about this!",
    "” he declared, and he\r\nwas off, loping back up the slope to the house, leaving us alone in our outpost.\r\n“Well, if the sheriff does show;’ Jason soberly said, “let’s just be damned sure\r\nhe knows we’re only firing in the air.”\r\nJohn agreed. “That’s all the Old Man wants anyhow.” His voice had a quaver\r\nto it. “He knows that when they see we’re serious about defending our home,\r\nthey’ll likely back off\r\n“Yeah, well, I’d like to make it count,” I said. “I’d like to take one of them\r\nAhabs down.” I aimed my musket out the window of the cabin. “Just like that.\r\nBoom! Take down the chief. One shot, and the fight’s over. That’s how you do it,\r\ny’ know.”\r\n“Don’t be an idiot,” John said. “Come on, give us a hand. We’ve got to turn\r\nthis cabin into Father’s idea of Ticonderoga.”\r\n“Or Zion” Jason added.\r\nThe afternoon of the first day passed quickly, and then Ruth brought us our\r\nsupper, and darkness fell. We kept watch throughout the night and slept in four-\r\nhour shifts. The next day, we busied ourselves building a sort of palisado of old\r\nboards and odd-sized timbers around the front of the cabin, a peculiar-looking\r\nwall that seemed to have no military or domestic function, for it was incapable\r\nof keeping anyone out or in. It was more imagined than real, but the entire\r\nepisode was more imagined than real.\r\nWhich made it perfect for me. I kept my musket close by while I worked, and\r\nevery now and then dropped my work, grabbed up the gun, and, crouching low\r\nto the ground, aimed into the nearby bushes. “Boom! Got ’im! Victory for the\r\nBrowns! Death to the invaders!”\r\nBy the end of the second day, we had grown bored and restless; even I. Father\r\ncame down from the tannery, where he was hard at work filling orders for hides,\r\nand bucked us up, or at least me, with talk of bloody defiance, and then strode\r\nback to the house again.",
    " We were not altogether unhappy to be freed of our\r\nusual tasks at the tannery, but we were growing impatient for action.\r\nEarly the following morning, we were up and about the cabin, grumbling over\r\nthe uselessness of our charge. “This whole affair is just another of the Old Man’s\r\ndamned fantasies!’ Jason said. He was lumped up in a corner of the cabin,\r\nsulking in his blanket. “I’ll be glad when he gives it up. Even if it means we have\r\nto go back to scraping hides.”\r\nJohn, who was then a sometime student of business accounting and commerce\r\nin a school over in Akron, sat on the dirt floor by the window with a book in his\r\nlap, studying his lessons. “There’s nothing to be done anyhow. The law’s the\r\nlaw”,John said without looking up. “The Old Man just takes a while to realize it.\r\nHe’ll come around eventually. He always does.”\r\nI stood at the open doorway, where, looking right, I could see along the broad\r\nroad from Hudson, and, on the left, Father trudging down the lane from the\r\nhouse with our breakfast in a sack, hot corn bread, I hoped, and plum jam and\r\nboiled eggs. Father apparently had already been hard at work in the tannery, for,\r\ndespite the morning coolness, he was not wearing his usual coat and shirt, only\r\nhis red undershirt, with his trousers held up by wide suspenders.\r\nHe was fifty or sixty yards from the cabin, when I heard horses coming along\r\nthe road and turned and saw a group of men approaching, three or four on\r\nhorseback and several more in a light trap drawn by a pair of roans. One of the\r\nriders I recognized as the county sheriff, another as Mr. Chamberlain, the newly\r\ndespised new owner of our farm. I also recognized several of the riders as Mr.\r\nChamberlain’s sons. The men in the trap I assumed were deputies. It was an\r\nimpressive force, and they appeared well-armed.\r\nStill some distance uphill from us, Father saw them, too.",
    " “Shoot them if they\r\ncome off the road and step a single foot onto our land, boys!” he hollered, and I\r\nducked into the cabin, where John was already scrambling for his musket.\r\nJason peered out the window that faced the road and said, “Oh, no. They’ve\r\ncome.” John and I swiftly stood side by side at the door and made our guns\r\nvisible to the riders, who were now pulling up before the cabin and our rickety\r\nwall, although they were not yet on our land, so we were not obliged to shoot.\r\nFather, in his undershirt and galluses, was a ways off but coming on with\r\npurposeful stride and a steadily reddening face. He had no gun in hand, only our\r\npoor breakfast.\r\n“Shoot that traitor Amos Chamberlain, shoot him first, boys!” he shouted.\r\n“He’s the villainous one! Spare the others—they’re just doing their legal duty!”\r\nI took dead aim at the forehead of the bearded, bulky Mr. Chamberlain atop\r\nhis chestnut stallion. Then I heard a rustling behind me and turned and saw\r\nJason clambering out the rear window of the cabin. He had left his musket\r\nleaning against the wall. In a second, he was gone, disappeared into the heavy\r\nbrush. “Jason’s fled!” I whispered to John.\r\n“He’s not stupid,” John said in a low voice, and I saw that my brother had\r\nlowered his musket and was standing forward in the portal. Then, with his gun\r\npointed peacefully at the ground, he stepped outside the cabin and walked\r\nslowly towards the intruders.\r\nUnsure of what to do now, I kept my gun trained on Mr. Chamberlain and\r\nlooked to my left towards Father, as if for instructions. Up the sloping lane\r\nbehind him, I could see my stepmother with the infant Peter in her arms and the\r\nseven younger children beside her on the wide porch of the white, two-storey\r\nhouse. Salmon and Watson were holding on to the dogs, and Ruth had in her\r\nhands a large wooden bowl.",
    " The unpainted barn and tannery shed and the sheep\r\npens were off to the right of the house, with the vegetable garden on the left and\r\nthen the apple orchard and Father’s mulberry trees and the corn field further on.\r\nRising slowly behind the house were wide rolling green meadows bordered by\r\nleafy oak and chestnut trees and our two remaining milch cows and the mares\r\ngrazing in the shade by the stone wall at the near edge of the hickory forest. It\r\ntruly was a lovely farm, the prettiest place we had ever lived in, Father’s last\r\nremaining tie to an orderly life.\r\nSlowly, I lowered my gun and stepped forward beside John, as Father came\r\nup, still holding the sack with our breakfast. I remember smelling the corn\r\nbread, stronger even than the smell of the sweating horses and men grouped\r\nbefore us.\r\n“H’lo, Brown,” the sheriff said, and he cleared his throat and spat a stream of\r\ntobacco. He was a tall, mustachioed man with a paunch the size of a wicker\r\nbasket. “I guess you know why we’re here. We don’t need to have no trouble.\r\nThis can all go peacefully.”\r\n“There’ll be no peace in this place, so long as that man insists on taking my\r\nhouse and land!” Father said, pointing fiercely at Mr. Chamberlain, who puffed\r\nhis considerable size up and chewed his thick lips in fury.\r\nThe sheriff went on calmly, as if Father had said nothing. “You got to give it\r\nover, Brown. Otherwise, I’m going to have to place you under arrest. The law is\r\nclear here, Brown. Any further quarrels about deeds or title you got with Mister\r\nChamberlain here you can settle in court on your own later. Right now, though,\r\nthe place and its contents is legally his. You and your family, you got to clear\r\nout.”\r\n“We will not leave our land!”\r\n“It’s not your land anymore, Brown!” Mr. Chamberlain shouted down.\r\n“You won’t pack up your family and personal household articles and go\r\npeacefully?",
    "” the sheriff said.\r\n“He can’t take no household articles!” Mr. Chamberlain cried. “They’re all\r\ngoing to be auctioned off, soon’s he clears out. He knows all this! He’s just\r\nstalling till he can sneak off with property that isn’t legally his no more.”\r\n“Be quiet, Amos,” the sheriff said. “One more time, Brown. Make it easy on\r\nyourself and your family.”\r\n“In order to take my land,” Father declared, lapsing, as he often did when his\r\nfeelings were high, into Quaker speech, “thou must first squash me and mine\r\nbeneath thy foot! I will not help thee in this heinous act!”\r\n“Oh, dammit, then. You’re under arrest, Mister Brown,” the sheriff said, and he\r\nordered Father to step up peacefully into the trap. “Don’t make me put irons on\r\nyou, Brown. This is a tough enough business as it is, putting folks off their land,\r\nwithout you making it any tougher.”\r\nThen, to my shock and sharp disappointment, Father’s shoulders sagged. He\r\nmeekly asked if he could first retrieve his shirt and coat and his Bible from the\r\nhouse.\r\n“You let him back inside that house’ Mr. Chamberlain warned, “he might\r\ndecide to make a stand. There’s no telling what he’ll do to it. You’ve got him\r\nnow, so take him in.”\r\nFather looked plaintive and hurt. “But I must have my coat and shirt. I am not\r\nproperly dressed, sir. And my Bible. I need it.”\r\nThe sheriff hesitated a few seconds, but then said, “No, c’mon, Brown. One of\r\nyour boys here can bring your coat and so on, they can bring it to you later. I got\r\nto lock you up.”\r\n“A-hab.” Father said the word slowly and gave it the shading of a curse. But all\r\nthe force seemed to have gone out of him. He handed me the sack with our\r\nbreakfast and slowly stepped up into the trap and took a seat behind the driver.\r\nWe stood there by our ramshackle wall, John and I, and watched the men ride\r\noff with their sad, slumped prisoner.",
    " He sat in the wagon in his red undershirt,\r\nmiserable, humiliated, gazing back at us. I waved goodbye to him, but he made\r\nno sign.\r\nFinally, when they had gone from sight, Jason stepped cautiously around the\r\nside of the cabin and came and joined us.\r\n“Jason, you’re a bloody coward!” I shouted at him.\r\n“Sure. You bet I am.”\r\nJohn said, “Let it go, Owen. Jason did right. The Old Man had to lose this one.\r\nAnd he knew it. He was just blustering. He lost it way back. No sense making a\r\nfight over it now. They’ll let him out by tomorrow morning, if not before.”\r\n“What’s in the bag? Breakfast, I hope. I’m hungry as a hogl’ Jason said, and\r\nreached for the sack in my hand.\r\nI jerked it away and then swung it at him, smacking him on the forehead.\r\n“Hey, hey, hey!” John said. He took the bag from me, and the two of them\r\nwalked slowly away, up the lane towards the house, dividing the johnnycake\r\nand boiled eggs between them, while I hung back, standing alone by the side of\r\nthe road, fighting off a boy’s angry tears.\r\nBut by the same afternoon, Father was back. He walked down the road and up\r\nthe lane to the house, where, with as much dignity as he could muster in his\r\nundershirt, he somberly greeted us all around. Then he marched straight to the\r\ntannery, where he had hung his shirt and coat on a peg, and when he had\r\ndecorously dressed himself in his accustomed clothing, as if preparing to go to\r\nchurch, he told us, in a somber, measured way, what had happened. The sheriff\r\nhad delivered Father to the Akron jail, had even locked him inside a cell, but\r\nthen had released him at once on his own recognizance, pledged to appear at\r\ntrial later in the month. Mr. Chamberlain had agreed not to prosecute, so there\r\nwould be no trial, as long as by that time we had departed from the farm with\r\nno more personal property than we were permitted under the bankruptcy\r\nproceedings.",
    " “We must obey the law, children. Hard as it is,” he said.\r\n“But we were supposed to take a stand!” I declared. “You said we’d stand and\r\nfight. I was willing to shoot the man down, Father. I was! I was all ready and\r\nhad the man in my sights. Jason, he took off like a coward, but John and I—”\r\n“Enough!” Father said. “I am a fool. That’s all. It’s my fault that we’ve come to\r\nthis terrible a pass. If you want to shoot someone, Owen, shoot me.” He placed a\r\nheavy hand on my shoulder, then removed it and walked ahead of us to the\r\nhouse, to sort and separate and inventory all our farm and household goods for\r\nthe auction.\r\nEven today, so many years later, more than a whole lifetime later, I can recall\r\nevery one of the items exempted from public auction. They were the articles that\r\nwe carefully separated from the house and barn and put out onto the porch and\r\nyard and then packed into our wagon one by one, and later unpacked and\r\npacked again, over and over, hauling them through the next nine years by cart,\r\ncanal boat, and on our own backs, from one temporary domicile to another, all\r\nthe way to Springfield, Massachusetts, and eventually to the cold, hard hills of\r\nNorth Elba, where, at last, we set them down and they stayed put.\r\nThere at the Haymaker farm, I followed Father like a scribe from one end of\r\nthe crowded porch to the other and across the front yard, writing in a tablet,\r\nwhile he strictly enumerated each of the articles and goods that the law\r\npermitted us to own and carry off. I made two copies of the list, one to be\r\ndelivered to Mr. Chamberlain, signed by John Brown and notarized, and one for\r\nourselves, which, for a long time, wherever we lived, Father kept posted on the\r\nkitchen wall, as if it were a reminder of his wealth, instead of his poverty.",
    "\r\nFor years, every morning, afternoon, and evening, we passed by this list, until\r\nit was engraved in our memories, like the books of the Bible or the names of the\r\nEnglish kings. We older boys, especially Jason, could recite them like an\r\nalphabet, and often did, to the amusement of Mary and the younger children and\r\nto Father’s slight consternation—although he surely saw the joke, for he could\r\nhave removed the list from the wall at once, if hed wanted.\r\n10 Dining Plates\r\n1 set of Cups & Saucers\r\n1 set Teaspoons\r\n2 Earthen Crocks\r\n1 Pepper Mill\r\n1 Cider Barrel\r\n4 Wooden Tails\r\n6 Bedsteads\r\n1 Writing Desk\r\n4 Blankets\r\n1 Wash Tub\r\n1 pr.

    " Socks & Stockings\r\n7 Stocks & Handkerchiefs\r\n4 Bonnets\r\n1 Hat\r\n5 Palmlea/Hats\r\n8 Men’s and Boys’ Cloth Caps\r\n1 Fur Cap\r\n1 Leather Cap\r\nSuch were all the worldly goods of a farming family of thirteen people, and\r\nover the following years our inventory did not vary much, for we did not add to\r\nour property: that was quite impossible, except here and there, with the addition\r\nof a revolver, for instance, or a few more cows or hogs. We simply replaced what\r\nwore out or got eaten.\r\nChapter 4\r\nCertain things said and described in my last missive have prompted in me fresh\r\nthoughts and memories of how we as a family loved Father, and how I in\r\nparticular loved him. But from the tender shape of your inquiry when we met, I\r\ndeduce that you and Professor Villard believe my father to have been a great\r\nman. I’m not so sure I agree.\r\nPerhaps my opinion on this question is of no account here, for I was never in a\r\nposition to take his measure, except as his son. And maybe we mean different\r\nthings by greatness. I wonder if you mean something more like fame. For me,\r\nFather could have been great without having been famous. Nonetheless, I can\r\nunderstand your position. You have a historian’s perspective.\r\nTo you, it matters not that during his lifetime, like all abolitionists, Father was\r\na much despised man, and that not just slaveholders hated him, but Whigs as\r\nmuch as Democrats; that he was hated by white people generally; and then, after\r\nKansas and Harpers Ferry and during the Civil War years and beyond, even to\r\ntoday, that he was reviled by Southerners and Copperheads and even by many\r\nwho had long supported the abolitionist cause, Republicans and the such.",
    " Nor,\r\nvery probably, does it matter to you that he was also widely admired and even\r\nloved, loved passionately and almost universally by Negroes and by the more\r\nradical white abolitionists, and that he was celebrated and sung by all the most\r\nfamous poets, writers, and philosophers here and abroad. What matters to you is\r\nthat between those two extreme poles of opinion concerning John Brown, since\r\nDecember 12, 1859, every American man, woman, and child has held an opinion\r\nof his own. So, yes, Miss Mayo, if greatness is merely great fame and is defined\r\nby an ability to arouse strong feelings of an entire people for many generations,\r\nthen Father, like Caesar, like Napoleon and Lincoln, was indeed a great man.\r\nBut who amongst your new, young historians and biographers, even amongst\r\nthose who loathe him or think him mad, has considered the price paid for that\r\nsort of greatness by those of us who were his family? Those of us who neither\r\nexamined him from a safe distance, as you do, nor stood demurely in his\r\nprotective shadow, as we have so often been portrayed, but who lived every\r\nsingle day in the full glare of his light?\r\nWe were, after all, none of us dullards or witless. Every one of us Browns was\r\nof the energetic, sanguinary type, stubborn in thought and garrulous in speech.\r\nWhy, even poor Fred, for all his innocent simplicity, when grown was a\r\nformidable figure of a man, independent and capable of astonishing acts: witness\r\nhis bravery at the Battle of Black Jack in Kansas; witness his shocking self-\r\nmutilation. And both of Father’s wives, my mother, Dianthe, and my stepmother,\r\nMary, were willful, extremely capable women of considerable intelligence and\r\nsound judgement. How else could they have managed the hard life that Father\r\nimposed upon them?\r\nWe were not easily cowed or led. We rose early, worked hard, and talked\r\nconstantly.",
    " We reacted intensely and elaborately to every person, idea, and\r\nopinion that passed into our ken, to everything that occurred in the private life\r\nof each member of the family and that we heard about in the larger world as\r\nwell. Whatever passed for news in those days, especially if it in the slightest way\r\nconcerned the slavery question, went discussed at our table and afterwards\r\naround the fire and while we rode into town for supplies and worked in the\r\nfields and tannery. We talked and talked and talked, and we argued with one\r\nanother; even the smaller children, though they could barely form sentences yet,\r\nwere encouraged to speak out on great topics and small. And at night in our\r\nbeds, lying in the darkness of the loft, we continued talking, arguing, explaining,\r\nwith lowered voices now, slower, rumbling towards sleep, one by one breaking\r\noff from the discussion of right and wrong, true and false, until one voice only\r\nremained, speculative, exploratory, tentative, and then, at long last, silence.\r\nOnly to be broken at first light, usually by Father at the bottom of the stairs,\r\ncalling to begin the day: Rise and shine, children!. Rise and shine! He’d already be\r\nup and dressed, with his Bible open on the table where he’d had his few\r\nmoments of solitary study. And the round of the day would begin again, like a\r\ngreat wheel spinning, and its prime mover was not the sun—it only seemed so—\r\nbut Father and his words and his bright, gray-eyed face. For, compared to the\r\nrest of us, no matter how hotly burned our individual flame, Father’s was a\r\nconflagration. He burned and burned, ceaselessly, it seemed, and though we\r\nwere sometimes scorched by his flame, we were seldom warmed by it.\r\nTrue, I loved the man beyond measure. He shaped me and gave me a life that\r\ntook on great meaning.",
    " Many was the time, however, when I grew angry and\r\nwished to flee from him and his harsh, demanding God. Yet I stayed. It’s strange,\r\nbut regardless of the pain and self-recrimination that my inability to worship\r\nFather’s God caused me, during all those years when other young men were\r\nseparating themselves off from their fathers and mothers and establishing their\r\nown households, often far away in the West, more than any other single thing, it\r\nmay well have been my discomfiting apostasy itself that kept me at his side. I\r\nwas not as intelligent or skilled as some of my brothers and sisters—as Jason, for\r\ninstance, who, besides being saintly in his moral sensitivity, was an almost\r\npreternaturally clever mechanic and agronomist. And compared to Ruth, whose\r\nemotions were consistently of an even and balanced nature, I was turbulent and\r\nchangeable and sometimes truculent. Unlike the eldest of us, John, who had a\r\ndeep, philosophical cast of mind, I seemed often shallow and merely pragmatic.\r\nThus I was an ordinary fellow struggling with a tangled, profoundly conflicted\r\nset of views and feelings, and I came late, slowly, and only partially, and in fits\r\nand starts, to a clear understanding of the true nature of my relation to Father\r\nand to the family as a whole, and I just as often lost my grasp on the subject as I\r\ndiscovered it. I was like Jonah, it sometimes seemed, fleeing not God’s wrath but\r\nHis will and His fierce, irrefutable logic. I cannot speak for the others, of course,\r\nbut we often had to console one another to keep ourselves from falling into\r\ndespair because of having temporarily lost Father’s approval. To a surprising\r\ndegree, we who fell away from belief in Father’s God were able to do so, perhaps\r\nwere invited to do so, because we were stuck with Father himself for a God, and\r\ntry as we might, we could no more escape our god than he could his.",
    " Especially\r\nI.\r\nIt is ironic, then, that Father regarded as his supreme failure his inability to\r\nbring all of us children to share his belief. We were godly enough in our\r\ncomportment; we were pious. But we would not believe. Even some of his\r\ndaughters, as they became adults, would not believe. Although, unlike us boys,\r\nthey did not think they should tell him of it. Perhaps because they were women\r\nand had more faith than we males in the usefulness of secrecy and decorum,\r\nperhaps because they were kinder than we—regardless, for all of us, it was as if\r\nFather’s own light burned so brightly that it eclipsed the Sun that shone on him.\r\nThus it came to seem to us that it shone on him alone. And because from him we\r\nreceived only reflected light, as from the moon, we were not always so much\r\nwarmed by it as merely illuminated.\r\nThere did come a time, however, when I arrived at an understanding and got a\r\nglimpse of the cost of the only path through life that was not revealed to us\r\nsolely by Father’s light. It was in the fall of ’46,1 remember, and Father was out\r\neast alone, in Springfield, establishing his warehousing scheme for Mr. Simon\r\nPerkins, of whom you have no doubt already heard. We were then living on Mr.\r\nPerkins’s farm in Akron, not as servants, exactly, but at his sufferance, which\r\nFather preferred to think of as a partnership.\r\nRuth was seventeen years old that fall, a blooming young woman whose\r\nsprightly company was much sought after by the young fellows in the\r\nneighborhood, for her good sense, her good humor, and her broad-faced good\r\nlooks. Not including Fred, who was sixteen years old and more or less looked\r\nafter himself, there were six young children then at home—the youngest being\r\nAmelia, or Kitty, as we called her, who was barely one year old.",
    " Consequently,\r\nRuth was obliged to be constantly at work with Mary, caring for the younger\r\nchildren and managing the house. Oliver was only six years old, but the other\r\nboys, Salmon, Watson, and Fred, were, like me, tending Mr. Perkins’s—and, as\r\nFather would have it, John Brown’s—large flock of sheep and running the farm.\r\nMutton Hill was our affectionate name for the place, and an appropriate one, for\r\nMr. Perkins’s flock numbered close to two hundred at that time.\r\nAll told, it was not a difficult operation, but there was no leisure time for any\r\nof us, a lack that was probably felt more by poor Ruth than by anyone else, due\r\nto her oncoming young womanhood and the presence there in Akron of a lively\r\ncommunity of young men and women her age, all of them scouting and\r\nreconnoitering each other with the intensity and restlessness typical of rural\r\nyouth in the throes of first rut. Despite her high spirits, Ruth was, as always,\r\nsingularly pious and virtuous, but that did not mean she was not as moody and\r\ndistracted as the other boys and girls of her acquaintance. Perhaps, because of\r\nher piety and virtue, she was even more agitated than the others. But who can\r\nsay? I’m probably thinking of how I myself was at that age; I know next to\r\nnothing of what females experience.\r\nEven so, I remember her seeming sometimes to smile absently and day-dream\r\nher way through those long, darkening fall afternoons and in the evenings to\r\nsigh a lot, letting loose with plaintive exhalations, as if pining for a lover far\r\naway. She had no lover, of course; and no one special was courting her then. But\r\nshe was on occasion uncharacteristically withdrawn and thoughtful that summer\r\nand fall and was noticeably awkward at times, which was unusual enough for us\r\nto comment on, and when she bumped her head or stumbled over a doorstoop,\r\nwe teased her for it.",
    "\r\nI have been unfortunately blessed by having been placed in my life so as to\r\nwitness firsthand most of the tragic and painful events that have afflicted my\r\nfamily, and thus have been too often obliged to carry the sad news to the others.\r\nThis is no complaint, but there was a peculiar loneliness to the task, for neither\r\nwas I the victim nor was I permitted to fall down in the dust and grieve: I had to\r\nspeak as if I had no pain. For most of my life, it seems, that is how I was forced\r\nto speak. Perhaps that is why, when I grew older and the great events that\r\nmarked our family were in the past, I withdrew to my mountain in California\r\nand remained silent altogether; and why now, when I know that I will never\r\nagain have to witness the suffering of my loved ones, for they have all died or\r\ngrown old themselves, I am compelled to tell so much.\r\nOn the occasion of which I speak here, I was obliged to write Father a terrible\r\nletter. I cannot now say exactly why I was chosen, but John and Jason were\r\nliving apart from us for the first time, and there was no other adult at home\r\nthen, except for Mary, whose letter-writing skills were not so developed as mine,\r\nand Ruth, who, as a principal in the awful news I was obliged to transmit, had\r\nbeen rendered incapable of speaking for herself, either in a letter or in person.\r\nDear Father, I wrote with trembling hand. I do not know how to begin, for I must\r\nwrite to you of a dreadful event which occurred here the evening before last. Mary\r\nwas upstairs in the girls’ bedroom with three-year-old Annie, who had been\r\nfeeling poorly all day and appeared to be coming down with the croup, which\r\nhad almost taken her off the previous spring, so it was an occasion for some\r\nalarm.",
    " I heard Mary’s footsteps overhead as she walked back and forth in the\r\nbedroom, from Annie’s small bed to the nightstand and dresser, easing the child\r\ninto bed and towards sleep. Oliver and Salmon were in the second bedroom, the\r\nloft where we boys slept, practicing the wrestling holds that I had taught them\r\nearlier that summer, making their usual grunting sounds, as if they were ancient\r\nGreeks in an arena instead of little American boys grappling on the floor and\r\ncolliding with the homemade furniture of a farmhouse bedroom. Watson was up\r\nthere with them, seated on one of the beds, no doubt, instructing his younger\r\nbrothers and criticizing their lack of wrestling skills. Fred and I were in the\r\nparlor, off the kitchen, where he sat by the front window, talking through the\r\nglass to the two little collies outside, who leapt about and barked at the sight of\r\nhis friendly face, hoping to be let in where it was warm and where all their\r\npeople had gone.\r\nHaving just set and lit the evening fire, I was seated next to it and, as I had\r\nmade a trip that afternoon into town for feed and some nails, was preparing to\r\nenter into the account book the day’s expenses. Mr. Perkins was responsible for\r\nall costs associated with the keeping of the flock, and thus we kept scrupulous\r\ntrack of our expenses. I would have written to you at once, but there has been no\r\ntime for it until now. Our little Kitty has died, a painful & tragic death with much\r\nsuffering that thankfully she did not have to long endure. From where I sat, I could\r\nsee around the corner the tin bathtub on the floor of the kitchen. The kitchen\r\nstove, however, was out of my line of sight, as were Ruth and the baby, Kitty,\r\nwhom I could hear gurgling and burbling over one of the house cats.\r\nRuth was silent.",
    " Perhaps she, like Fred in the parlor, was looking out her\r\nwindow in the kitchen, looking not at the dogs begging Fred to let them come\r\ninside but at some imagined young man strolling down the pathway from the\r\nroad from town, a beau come to call, a sweetheart of her own venturing forth to\r\nmeet her large, boisterous, somewhat notorious family in the absence of the\r\nstern, demanding father, hoping to befriend the brothers and talk politely and\r\ndeferentially to the woman of the house, so that when the father returned they\r\nwould all speak well of the young man, and the father would then allow his\r\neldest daughter to go walking with him. Kitty’s untimely death was the result of a\r\nsimple, blameless accident. It was in the evening about 7o’clock & Ruth was heating\r\nwater, so that the little children could bathe; and due to some business about the\r\nhouse, what with the usual commotion of the children & cooking supper, the water\r\nheated to a boil, and when Ruth ran to fetch the pot from the stove, she did not\r\nrealize it was so hot & as a result she dropped it; & the boiling water splashed all over\r\nlittle Kitty, who was standing naked next to her waiting for her bath, and who\r\nevidently swallowed a great gulp of it when it spilled over her body, which was a\r\nmercy, for otherwise she would not have died so swiftly and would have lingered in\r\nterrible pain. I heard a horrible yowl, the cry of a wild animal, not that of a\r\nhuman being, and not so much a cry of pain as an enraged, savage shriek. That\r\nwas the last utterance made by our baby sister Kitty, who had just begun to walk\r\nand say our names in ways that made us laugh and re-name ourselves, a blond,\r\npink-skinned, robust child, made suddenly monstrous by her wild, final howl.\r\nAnd then, just as suddenly, there was silence in the whole house.",
    " It was a\r\nterrible scene, Father, as you can no doubt imagine, horrible to us all; & especially\r\nto poor Ruth, who is suffering from unspeakable guilt & remorse. She has shut\r\nherself away from the rest of us, & weeps constantly, & when she does speak, it is to\r\nbeg for forgiveness, especially of Mary, who is seriously shaken from the incident but\r\nasks me to say to you that she trusts in God and knows that Kitty is in heaven with\r\nHim. The silence may have lasted no more than a second, but it seemed to go on\r\nfor a long while, before Ruth began to moan, “Oh-h-h, oh-h-h ... ,” a moan that,\r\nin contrast to Kitty’s howl, was purely, uniquely, pathetically human, a noise\r\nthat is made by no creature but one who has been the direct cause of the death\r\nof a child.\r\nWithout having observed anything of the accident, except for the steaming\r\nskin of water that spread slowly across the floor towards the empty tin bathtub, I\r\nknew at once what had happened. And I believe that Fred knew, too, for we\r\nlooked at one another for an instant, and his eyes were filled with unutterable\r\nsorrow. Ruth begged me at first not to write to you, so that she could be the one to\r\nbear this burden; but then said that she could not do it. So I have done it. By the time\r\nI reached the kitchen, Mary had come down the stairs, her face white with\r\nknowledge of what had already happened, and we saw Ruth standing in the far\r\ncorner of the room with the scarlet body of the baby in her arms. The large black\r\nkettle, like a head with a gaping mouth, lay on its side on the floor next to the\r\nstove, the spilled, translucent water a carpet of snakes spreading around table\r\nlegs and chairs.\r\nRuth’s eyes had rolled back, and she was making a guttural noise now, as if\r\nshe were choking. The baby had already died. Its scalded, bright red body was\r\nemptied of spirit.",
    " It was a thing, a tiny, shriveled sack, and its small soul was\r\nbouncing wildly around the room near the ceiling, like a maddened, dying moth,\r\na bit of quickly diminishing light. I held Mary by her shoulders, and together we\r\napproached Ruth, and very gently Mary reached out and took the body of her\r\nbaby from her stepdaughter, turned, and walked away from us into the parlor,\r\npast poor Fred, who stood at the door with his hands over his ears, as if he still\r\nheard the baby’s howl. Silently, I came and stood before Ruth and held her in\r\nmy arms, but she was insensible of my presence and went on making a choking\r\nnoise, her head tilted back, eyes whitened and unseeing, as if she had fallen into\r\na deep trance. She needs to hear from you, Father, the same as she has heard from\r\nMary & me (& from John & Jason as well, for they have come down from\r\nAshtabula). She needs to hear that you do not blame her for the death of Kitty. She\r\nblames herself more than enough for any of us to add a word. I tell you, it was not\r\nRuth’s fault. She will never see it that way herself, however. It was a simple accident,\r\n& any one of us could have been the agency for it to happen as easily as was poor\r\nRuth. Mary dressed the body of the child in a tiny flannel nightgown, wrapped it\r\nin a blanket, as if preparing it for sleep, and that same night I went into the\r\nbarn, and as Father himself had done only a few years before, in that terrible\r\nwinter of ’43, when four of his children sickened one by one and died, I built for\r\nthe first time in my life a small pine coffin.",
    "\r\nThe boys, not knowing what else to do, followed me out to the barn and in the\r\ndim lantern light watched me in silence, as I had watched Father, the four of\r\nthem standing there like somber acolytes, learning how to cut the boards to the\r\ncorrect size for the body of a child, so that the coffin would hold the child\r\nsnugly, without confining it or bending it out of its natural shape, watching me\r\ncarefully plane and fit the boards neatly together and drive the nails without\r\ndamaging the wood and hinge the cover and latch it. We have buried little Kitty\r\nout behind the house, near where you planted the crab-apple trees last spring, & am\r\nmaking a proper marker for her that will say her dates and name, & any little motto,\r\nif you wish one for her. Mr. and Mrs. Perkins have been a great comfort to Mary & to\r\nthe rest of us, & Mrs. Perkins has taken Annie & Oliver over to the big house for the\r\ntime being, to make things easier for Mary; & many other local folks have come to the\r\nhouse with condolences Gsympathy. At the burial, I touched Ruth on the cheek\r\nwith the fingertips of my right hand and put my claw of a left hand around her\r\nback and drew my sister close to me, as if to take into myself her grief and to\r\nshare with her the shame she felt. The others at the graveside, our friends and\r\nneighbors, looked at us, and I was glad of that, for I wished them to see that all\r\nof us Browns were equally to blame for the death of our Kitty and that,\r\ntherefore, no single one of us was to blame. I am sorry, Father, to be bringing you\r\nsuch terrible news. I hope that the business is going well. No particular problems with\r\nthe flocks or the farm here. Your loving son,\r\nOwen Brown\r\nIt was not until nearly a fortnight had passed that we heard from Father at\r\nlast.",
    " Due to the inescapable daily requirements of our livestock and the farm,\r\nwhich honor no human tragedy, the life of the family had resumed its old\r\npatterns and routines and had connected back to its various larger cycles by\r\nthen; and even Ruth had made a few tentative steps back into the fold, as it\r\nwere, although she was a much altered young woman. She had become the\r\nsober, even melancholy woman that she would remain for most of her life\r\nthereafter, even during her happiest years, when she and Henry Thompson were\r\ncourting up in North Elba and in the first year of their marriage, before Henry\r\nrode off with us to Kansas.\r\nFather’s letter, arriving as it did after we had already commenced to\r\naccommodate our lives and feelings as best we could to the death of Kitty, was\r\npainful to read aloud, as was our custom with all his letters, and, later on,\r\ndifficult for me to copy, as per his instructions, for Father had long since told us\r\nto be sure that all his letters were copied and saved, and as I had the best\r\nhandwriting of any in the family at that time, the task usually fell to me. My\r\ndear afflicted Wife & Children, he wrote, and I wrote after him. I yesterday at night\r\nreturned after an absence of several days from this place & am utterly unable to give\r\nany expression of feelings on hearing of the dreadful news contained in Owen’s letter\r\nof the 30th and Mr. Perkins’s of the 31st Oct. I seem to be struck almost dumb. Not\r\nlikely, I thought. For I was angry at Father, not so much for his letter, which was\r\nabout all he could have said under the circumstances and which was very much\r\nin his usual voice.",
    " I suppose I was angry at his not being present when we all,\r\nand especially Ruth, suffered from the death of little Kitty, so that not only did\r\nwe have to endure the horror and pain of that event alone but we had to report\r\nit to him as well—for his judgement, his huge perspective, his words of\r\nbeneficence or condemnation, as if he were some lord high sheriff and we were\r\nhis serfs who had to account for the loss of one of our number—without\r\nmentioning in our account that she whom we had lost was an especially beloved\r\nchild, without mentioning that the awful conditions of her death had inflicted\r\nlifelong pain and shame in the heart of one of us in particular.\r\nNone of this, of course, was Father’s fault; yet that did not hinder my anger, as\r\nI copied his letter into the green school notebook used for the purpose. One more\r\ndear, feeble child am I to meet no more till the dead, small & great, shall stand before\r\nGod. This is a bitter cup, children, but a cup blessed by God: a brighter day shall\r\ndawn; & let us not sorrow, like those who have no hope. Oh, if only we who remain\r\nhad wisdom wisely to consider & to keep in view our latter end. This, I knew, was a\r\npointed reference to me and to John and Jason, for surely we were the ones who\r\nwere obliged to “sorrow like those who have no hope” of ever being amongst the\r\nsmall and great standing before God. Our sorrow, mine and my brothers’, was\r\nthe greater, Father implied, because as unbelievers we believed that we would\r\nnot see poor Kitty again, and that was too bad, just too bad, and nobody’s fault\r\nbut our own. According to Father, the brighter day was not ours to believe in,\r\nand thus we had no wisdom wisely to consider.",
    "\r\nIn normal circumstances, this difference between us and Father did not create\r\nany painful conflict; but when we, too, were suffering, when we ourselves were\r\ngrieving, it only angered us that he regarded the ragged edge of our pain as\r\nmerely a consequence of our moral failings. There was no telling him of this,\r\nhowever.\r\nOh, we could tell him of it, yes; but he could not hear us, his own belief was so\r\npowerful, so constantly clanging in his ears: with all those hosannas, halleluiahs,\r\nand simple hoo-rahs he was hearing, it was to his large, hairy ears as if nothing\r\nbut a serpent’s hiss were coming from our mouths. Divine Providence seems to lay\r\na heavy burden & responsibility on you in particular, my dear Mary; but I trust that\r\nyou will be enabled to bear it in some measure, as you ought. I exceedingly regret that\r\nI am unable to return & be present to share your trials with you; but anxious as I am\r\nto be once more at home, I do not feel at liberty to return to Akron yet. I hope to be\r\nable to get away before very long; but cannot say when. These words I could barely\r\ntranscribe without breaking off the point of my pen, and the tension in my hand\r\ncaused me to spatter the paper with several ugly blots of ink. But he was not\r\nthrough. I trust that none of you will feel disposed to cast an unreasonable blame on\r\nmy dear Ruth on account of the dreadful trial we are called to suffer; for if the want\r\nof proper care in each all of us has not been attended with fatal consequences, it is no\r\nthanks to us. With a cold fury in my heart, though I said nothing of it to anyone, I\r\nsaw that Father could forgive Ruth only by including the rest of us in her blame,\r\nwhich, of course, allowed him to forgive no one.",
    " As he saw it, not just Ruth, but\r\nwe, all of us, were guilty of wanting proper care, so that it was only the Lord’s\r\nwill that had kept the rest of us from the fatal consequences of our sloth and\r\ninattention.\r\nIf I had a right sense of my habitual neglect of my family’s Eternal interests, I should\r\nprobably go crazy from shame, he said, and I transcribed. And as he had\r\napparently not gone crazy, were we to assume then that he did not have a right\r\nsense of his habitual neglect of his family’s Eternal interests? Was that his point?\r\nOr was he merely changing the subject, at which he was so skilled, in order to\r\ninvite us to reassure him, to praise him, to be thankful that he was out there in\r\nSpringfield looking after his family’s temporal, rather than Eternal, interests? I\r\nhumbly hope that this dreadful, afflictive Providence will lead us all more properly to\r\nappreciate the amazing, unforeseen, untold consequences that hang upon the right or\r\nwrong doing of things seemingly of trifling account. Who can tell or comprehend the\r\nvast results for good or evil that are to follow the saying of one little word? Everything\r\nworthy of being done at all is worthy of being done in good earnest & in the best\r\npossible manner. Not that again, I said to myself and dutifully wrote his words\r\ninto the tablet as if they were my own. Not more platitudes and maxims, not\r\nmore of Ben Franklin’s rules for living. We are in middling health, & expect to write\r\nto some of you again soon. Our warmest thanks to Mr. & Mrs. Perkins & family. From\r\nyour affectionate husband, & father,\r\nJohn Brown\r\nWhen I had finished transcribing the letter, I put the tablet away in the folder\r\nwhere we kept his papers, and we none of us read or spoke of the letter again.",
    " It\r\nwas odd, for we had suffered numerous deaths in the family by then, and each of\r\nthem had drawn us closer together; but the death of little Kitty caused me, and I\r\nthink the rest of us as well, to withdraw ourselves from Father to a greater\r\ndegree than any previous event or circumstance. Of course, here and there, now\r\nand again, one or the other of us had gone through a period of withdrawal from\r\nintimacy with Father, but it was almost always a solitary act, a brief and lonely\r\nrebellion. But on the occasion of Kitty’s death, we all as a group rebelled, even\r\nincluding Mary, and shut Father away from our feelings and conversations with\r\none another for many weeks afterwards.\r\n1 believe that I learned then for the first time that it was possible to oppose\r\nFather, to swell with anger against him and to walk away from his sputterings\r\nand recriminations, without any terrible cost to my own sense of worth as a man\r\nand without the crippling loneliness that I usually associated with opposing him.\r\nBut I could not do it until the rest of the family marched with me. The awful\r\nirony is that we could never march against him unless one of us was capable of\r\nsacrificing another of us beforehand—as Ruth had sacrificed the baby Amelia,\r\nlittle Kitty. Only then could we stand against him and say to him, “Father, you\r\ndo not understand.”\r\nYesterday, while searching through my cache of Father’s papers for the letters\r\nconcerning the death of poor Kitty, I happened onto another long-forgotten\r\ntranscription, which I am sure you have not read and which will show you an\r\naspect of Father’s character that may surprise and even amuse you. It may also\r\ngive you some further insight into the true nature of my relationship with\r\nFather, so that later, when I have told everything, you will believe me.",
    "\r\nThe document of which I speak, when it came to my hand, caused me\r\nunexpectedly to think back to the time when Father corked his face, as it were,\r\nand actually tried to pass himself off as a Negro. It was an audacious thing, but\r\nhe was fully aware of that and did it anyhow. His ostensible purpose was to\r\ninstruct and warn. He had carefully composed an essay entitled “Sambo’s\r\nMistakes,” which he read many times over to any of us who would listen and\r\nafter much hesitation finally submitted anonymously to the Negro editors of the\r\nRam’s Horn, in Brooklyn, New York. It was not published, probably because it\r\nwas seen for what it was—a white man in blackface telling Negroes how to\r\nbehave. The rejection of his little essay infuriated Father, for he believed that he\r\nwas saying things to Negroes that they ought to hear and rarely did, except\r\nwhen he himself told them in meetings or when invited to speak to the\r\ncongregations of Negro churches. He explained that he had chosen to speak as\r\nSambo because when he said these things to Negroes in whiteface, he was\r\nperceived strictly as a white man and thus was not truly heard. “Racialism\r\ninfects everybody’s ears,” he said. “Negro ears as much as white.”\r\nThis was in the winter of ’48, after we had left Akron and were newly settled\r\nin Springfield, and I found the whole thing somewhat embarrassing then,\r\nalthough later on I came to see that in a sense, perhaps subconsciously, Father\r\nwas advising and correcting himself as much as his Negro brethren. He was\r\nspeaking his little narrative, in spite of his intentions to disguise himself, with\r\nhis own genuine voice quite as much as when he wrote letters home and advised\r\nand corrected us. This may be of interest to you, for you were born long after\r\nFather’s death and can have no idea of how he sounded in actual conversation.",
    "\r\nFather’s voice, including his grammar and choice of words and his pacing, was\r\nmore or less the same whether spoken aloud or written down on paper. It was\r\nuniquely his own—although I was often told that I myself spoke very much like\r\nhim.\r\nEarlier today, I carried Father’s original manuscript of “Sambo’s Mistakes,”\r\nfrom which I had made the “official” copy that he submitted to the Rum’s Horn,\r\noutside my cabin and read it in the dying light of day. It is perhaps the nearness\r\nof our voices, his and mine, that enabled me to recall his voice exactly when I\r\nread through this composition, for I could hear him speaking to me quite as if he\r\nwere seated next to me on the stoop, the ink on the paper barely dry.\r\n“Tell me truthfully, Owen’ he said, “if you think I have left anything of use and\r\nimportance out. And note any particular infelicities of language, son, if you\r\nwill.” And then he began to read “Sambo’s Mistakes” aloud, very slowly,\r\nsavoring all the words as if they were great poetry.\r\nNotwithstanding that I have committed a few mistakes in the course of a long\r\nlife like others of my colored brethren, you will perceive at a glance that I have\r\nalways been remarkable for a seasonable discovery of my errors and my quick\r\nperception of the true course. I propose to give you a few illustrations in this and\r\nthe following paragraphs.",
    "\r\nFor instance, when I was a boy I learned to read, but instead of giving my\r\nattention to sacred and profane history, by which I might have become\r\nacquainted with the true character of God and man, learned the best course for\r\nindividuals, societies, and nations to pursue, stored my mind with an endless\r\nvariety of rational and practical ideas, profited by the experience of millions of\r\nothers of all ages, fitted myself for the most important stations in life, and\r\nfortified my mind with the best and wisest resolutions and noblest sentiments\r\nand motives, I have instead spent my whole life devouring silly novels and other\r\nmiserable trash such as most newspapers of the day and other popular writings\r\nare filled with, thereby unfitting myself for the realities of life and acquiring a\r\ntaste for nonsense and low wit, so that I have no relish for sober truth, useful\r\nknowledge, or practical wisdom. By this means I have passed through life\r\nwithout profit to myself or others, a mere blank on which nothing worth\r\nperusing is written.\r\nBut I can see in a twink where I missed it.\r\nAnother error into which I fell early in life was the notion that chewing and\r\nsmoking tobacco would make a man of me but little inferior to some of the\r\nwhites. The money I spent in this way, with the interest of it, would have\r\nenabled me to have relieved a great many sufferers, supplied me with a well-\r\nselected interesting library, and paid for a good farm for the support and\r\ncomfort of my old age; whereas I now have neither books, clothing, the\r\nsatisfaction of having benefited others, nor a place to lay my hoary head.\r\nHowever, I can see in a moment where I missed it.",
    "\r\nOne of the further errors of my life is that I have imitated frivolous whites\r\nby joining the Free Masons, Odd Fellows, Sons of Temperance, and a score of\r\nother secret societies and chapters established by and for men of color, instead\r\nof seeking the company of intelligent, wise, and good men of both races, from\r\nwhom I might have learned much that would be interesting, instructive, and\r\nuseful, and I have in that way squandered a great amount of most precious time\r\nand money, enough sometimes in a single year which, if I had put the same\r\nout on interest and kept it so, would have kept me always above board, given me\r\ncharacter and influence amongst men, or have enabled me to pursue some\r\nrespectable calling, so that I might employ others to their benefit and\r\nimprovement; but as it is, I have always been poor, in debt, and am now obliged\r\nto travel about in search of employment as a hostler, shoeblack, and fiddler.\r\nBut I retain all my quickness of perception and see readily where I missed it.\r\nAn error of my riper years has been that, when any meeting of colored people\r\nhas been called in order to consider an important matter of general interest, I\r\nhave been so eager to display my spouting talents and so tenacious of some\r\ntrifling theory or other which I have adopted, that I have generally lost all sight\r\nof the business at hand, consumed the time disputing about things of no moment,\r\nand thereby defeated entirely many important measures calculated to promote\r\nthe general welfare.\r\nBut I am happy to say that I know in a flash where I missed it. Another small\r\nerror of my life (for I have never committed great blunders) has been that, for\r\nthe sake of union in the furtherance of the most vital interests of our race, I\r\nwould never yield any minor point of difference.",
    " In this way I have always had\r\nto act with but a few men and frequently alone, and could accomplish nothing\r\nworth living for.\r\nBut I have one comfort, I can see with a passing glance where I missed it.\r\nA little but nonetheless telling fault which I have committed is that, if in\r\nanything another man has failed of coming up to my standard,\r\nnotwithstanding he might possess many of the most valuable traits and be\r\nmost admirably suited to fill some one important post, I would reject him\r\nentirely, injure his influence, oppose his measures, and even glory in his defeat,\r\nthough his intentions all the while were good and his plans well laid.\r\nBut I have the great satisfaction of being able to say without fear of\r\ncontradiction that I can see very quick where I missed it.\r\nAnother small mistake which I have made is that I could never bring myself\r\nto practice any present self-denial, although my theories have been excellent.\r\nFor instance, I have bought expensive gay clothing, nice canes, watches,\r\ngold safety-chains, finger-rings, breast pins, and other things of a like nature,\r\nthinking I might by that means distinguish myself from the vulgar, as some\r\nof the better class of whites do. I have always been of the foremost in\r\ngetting up expensive parties and running after fashionable amusements and have\r\nindulged my appetites freely whenever I had the means (and even with\r\nborrowed money) and have patronized the dealers in nuts, candy, cakes, etc.,\r\nhave sometimes bought good suppers, and was always a regular customer at\r\nlivery stables. By these and many other means I have been unable to benefit\r\nmy suffering brethren and am now but poorly able to keep my own soul and\r\nbody together.\r\nBut do not think me thoughtless or dull of apprehension, for I can see at once\r\nwhere I missed it.",
    "\r\nA not-so-trifling error of my life has been that I am always expected to\r\nsecure the favor of the whites by tamely submitting to every species of\r\nindignity, contempt, and wrong, instead of nobly resisting their brutal\r\naggressions from principle and taking my place as a man and assuming the\r\nresponsibilities of a man, a citizen, a husband, a father, a brother, a neighbor,\r\na friend, as God requires of every one (and if his neighbor will not allow him to\r\ndo it, he must stand up and protest continually and also appeal to God for aid!.).\r\nBut I find that, for all my submission, I get about the same reward that the\r\nSouthern Slavocrats render to the dough-faced statesmen of the North for being\r\nbribed and browbeat and fooled and cheated, as the Whigs and Democrats love\r\nto be, thinking themselves highly honored if they be allowed to lick up the\r\nspittle of a Southerner. I say I get the same reward’.\r\nBut I am uncommonly quick-sighted, and I can see in a twinkling where I\r\nmissed it.\r\nAnother little blunder which I have made is that, while I have always been\r\na most zealous abolitionist, I have been constantly at war with my friends\r\nabout certain religious tenets. I was first a Presbyterian, but I could never\r\nthink of acting with my Quaker friends, for they were the rankest heretics, and\r\nthe Baptists would be in the water, and the Methodists denied the doctrine of\r\nElection, etc., and in later years, since becoming enlightened by Garrison,\r\nAbby Kelley, and other really benevolent persons, I have been spending all my\r\nforce against friends who love the Sabbath and feel that all is at stake on that\r\npoint.\r\nNow, I cannot doubt, notwithstanding I have been unsuccessful, that you will\r\nallow me full credit for my peculiar quick-sightedness. As fast as I say it, I can\r\nsee where I missed it.",
    "’\r\nFather lowered the sheaf of lined pale blue paper, looked to me, and awaited my\r\nadmiration. “Well? What do you think, son?” he asked.\r\n“Yes... well;’ said I. “Yes, it’s... it’s very good. And you seem to have touched\r\non everything that concerns you. Though it does end rather abruptly, don’t you\r\nthink? I mean, is it enough simply to keep saying that you see in a twink where\r\nyou have missed it?”\r\n“No!” he said. “Of course not! That’s my point. Or will be, when I have made\r\nit. It’s what my second chapter will propose: what to do when you have seen the\r\nerror of your ways. You see, American Negroes don’t have a figure like Benjamin\r\nFranklin, and that’s what I’m trying to establish here. A friendly, wise scold.\r\nFranklin spoke only to white people, wisely and well, to be sure, but what he\r\nsaid is of little use to a people despised and downtrodden because of their race.\r\nFranklin’s book never addresses the whole race question. But Negroes—I’m\r\ntalking about the rank and file here, you understand, not the leaders—they need\r\na book of practical wisdom which is as accessible and amusing to them as\r\nFranklin’s is to us white folks, and as down-to-earth. Sambo is my Poor Richard,\r\nson.\r\n“When this is published in the Ram’s Horn, I’ll ask my colored friends what\r\nthey think of it—innocently, you understand, as if I knew nothing of the\r\nauthorship, testing their responses, getting suggestions as to what’s been left out.\r\nAnd then I’ll write my second chapter. A third and fourth chapter will follow,\r\nand so on, until I’ll have written an entire book, a book that can serve as a new\r\nprimer for Negroes in the fight against slavery.”\r\n“Fine, but why not let a Negro man write such a book?” I asked him, pointing\r\nout that there were plenty who were more than capable of it: Mr. Douglass, for\r\ninstance, or the Reverends Garnet and Loguen.",
    " “They could do it without a\r\ndisguise,” I added.\r\n“Please!” He laughed, as if he thought the idea ridiculous. “Owen, we’re after a\r\nblack Ben Franklin here, and none of those fine men is especially humorous or\r\ndown-to-earth. And even if he were, he’d have to disguise himself just as much\r\nas I have. For different reasons, of course. Not because of race, but because he’d\r\nbe so well-known amongst the Negro readership. Mister Douglass would have to\r\ncall himself Sambo, too, just as I have, or else he’d sound like the famous\r\nFrederick Douglass, and who would believe these were his mistakes?”\r\n“Who will believe, Father, that they are yours?” “No one knows who I am,” he\r\nsaid with a wink.\r\nNo, indeed. Back in ’48 in Springfield, Massachusetts, black or white, they did\r\nnot know who John Brown was. Not even I knew. There was a day coming,\r\nhowever, and not far off, when the whole world would know his name—from\r\nthe literary salons of Paris, France, to the humblest white farmer’s cabin of\r\nKentucky, from the Scottish castles of the English queen to the daub-and-wattle\r\nslave-quarters of Alabama. So go ahead, write your story now, Old Man. Be for\r\nblack folks a friendly, ordinary Negro scold, and do it while you can. Soon\r\nenough the man who is Sambo will be Old John Brown, Captain John Brown,\r\nOsawatomie Brown, a man who cannot hide who he is, even behind a beard and\r\na dozen false names, and who can never again claim to be other than white, who\r\ncan no longer even cultivate a fantasy that he is other than white. Though it will\r\nbe rarely said so baldly, his race—that he is a white man and in the interests of\r\nNegroes has coldly killed other white men—will become the most important\r\nthing about him.\r\nThe image of Father reading beside me has faded. The light that accompanied\r\nmy memory of him is gone, and although I cannot see him, I can still hear his\r\nvoice.",
    " He says to me, “It’s very dark here. You don’t mind the darkness, Owen?\r\nAnd the cold? It’s grown very cold since the sun set. Why not go inside and light\r\na fire?”\r\n“I do mind the darkness. It’s making me feel too much the pain of being alone.\r\nBut the cold, no. I don’t feel the cold.”\r\n“Then go inside your cabin, my boy, and light a candle.”\r\nThat was the winter and spring when we lived in Springfield in the house on\r\nFranklin Street, a wood-frame row house no wider than a single room, somewhat\r\ndilapidated, barely furnished, in a neighborhood of mostly Negro freedmen,\r\npeople who were even poorer than we. We were content, however, because for\r\nthe first time in several years we were residing together, a regular family, and\r\nFather was not working someplace far off, careening about the skies like a\r\nwandering star or a comet due to return home sometime in the distant future.\r\nEven John, with his new wife, Wealthy, was with us that year, helping Father\r\nrun Mr. Perkins’s wool warehouse.\r\nJohn was easier to deal with than Father, or so it appeared, for as soon as John\r\narrived from Ohio, the buyers of our wool began asking to see him, instead of\r\nthe Old Man. This left Father free to pursue his several projects concerning the\r\nwelfare and future of the Negroes in Springfield, who that year were particularly\r\nalarmed by the growing number of slave-catchers prowling through Northern\r\ncities. Father’s abolitionist work had taken on a new intensity there and a\r\nfreshened singleness of purpose, probably because of the presence in Springfield\r\nof a large number of freedmen who were agreeable to him for their intelligence\r\nand for the ferocity of their opposition to slavery. It no doubt helped that he, in\r\nhis fervor and clarity of purpose, was agreeable to them as well.",
    "\r\nI myself was attached to the warehouse, where I was responsible for cleaning\r\nand sorting the wool that came in from the west, mostly from Father’s and Mr.\r\nPerkins’s associates in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attending to its proper\r\nstorage and, when the occasional sale was made to one of the woolen\r\nmanufacturers, packing and shipping it on to the huge new factory looms of\r\neastern Massachusetts. It was boring work, but not particularly arduous, and left\r\nme perhaps too much solitary time for dreaming about a future that in my heart\r\nI suspected would never be mine.\r\nMy dreams were for the most part the foolish fancies of a very naive and\r\nunusually immature young man—a shepherd boy’s idea of sophisticated Eastern\r\nsociety. I was twenty-four years old that winter, and Springfield was the largest\r\ntown I had ever seen. The regular proximity of exotic (or so they seemed to me)\r\nyoung women kept me in an agitated state of mind and body, and I spent many\r\nan evening and early morning hour walking the streets alone, not so much to\r\nlook at the young women, for they were not so much to be found on the streets\r\nduring those hours anyhow, as to be alone with my tangled thoughts and\r\nfeelings, struggling to control and organize them.\r\nMost of my thoughts and feelings were surely driven by simple, natural male\r\ncuriosity, unnaturally heightened by my lifelong fear of women and my shyness\r\nwhen among them and the rural isolation of my life so far, but they disturbed\r\nand confused me. I hesitate to make this confession, especially to someone I do\r\nnot know and a woman, and very possibly I will write this down and then burn\r\nit, as I have certain other pages already written. In fact, I cannot say for certain\r\nif I have sent you some of these pages, all of them, or none.",
    " They are scattered\r\nand strewn about my table and cabin, and much of the time, when I am not\r\nseated here with pencil in hand, I am confused and lose myself and can’t\r\ndistinguish what I have done from what I have not done.\r\nI will tell everything. During the daylight hours, whenever I noticed an\r\nattractive woman, whether a pious young woman at church or a neighborhood\r\nfriend of Ruth’s or one of the daughters of a Negro cohort of Father’s at an\r\nabolitionist meeting, I quickly averted my gaze and made every attempt to\r\nremove myself from her presence. But later, in the nighttime—while alone and\r\nwalking the gaslit streets of the city, down along muddy, trash-strewn lanes and\r\nalleys by the river and past the taverns and brothels there, where I lingered\r\noutside and peered through fogged-over windows and glanced furtively through\r\ndoors as whiskeyed patrons entered and left, and along tree-lined boulevards up\r\non the heights where the large mansions were located and I stopped and gazed\r\nacross lawns to darkened verandas—I imagined all sorts of encounters with all\r\ntypes of women, and little plays took place on the stage of my mind, in which I\r\nspoke all the parts.\r\n“How do you do, miss? Are you out for an evening stroll? May I accompany\r\nyou a ways?”\r\n“Why, thank you, sir, I would appreciate your company and protection. Are\r\nyou a native of these parts, sir? For I do not think I know you.”\r\nThey were pathetic little dramas, which enflamed my passions and sent me\r\nreeling back to our house on Franklin Street, where the rest of the family slept\r\npeacefully and virtuously. There I would toss and writhe in my cot in the room\r\nthat I shared with my younger brothers, miserable, guilty, self-abusing.",
    "\r\nThus I little noticed the continued and worsening illness of another of the\r\nchildren, the baby, Ellen, born in Ohio the previous autumn, and I did not\r\nrealize that my stepmother, Mary, had not fully recovered from her lying-in\r\nperiod following the birth. I lived in a household whose rhythms and concerns\r\nwere being shaped once again by illness, and I did not notice. Here I was, this\r\nlarge, healthy young fellow lumbering out to work at the warehouse every\r\nmorning, returning in the evening for supper and then slipping out again,\r\nstumbling through his days and nights with his mind filled only by the\r\nturbulence of lustful fantasies at war with private shames, while the rest of the\r\nfamily worried over another frail and failing babe and a mother unable to\r\nrecover from the rigors of giving birth. In such a way did my preoccupation with\r\ntrivial sins, with my sensual indulgence and guilt, cause me to commit a graver\r\nsin and to feel no guilt for it. No wonder Father seemed short with me that\r\nwinter and spring: in my self-absorption, I thought that he and Mary and the rest\r\nof the family, John and Wealthy, Ruth, even the younger children, were casting\r\nme out, were not including me in their circle of intimate relations—when in fact\r\nit was I who had cast them out.\r\nThen one night late in April, a few weeks before we planned to depart for our\r\nnew home in the Adirondacks, I left the house in an unusually heightened state\r\nof alarm. I felt I had reached a fork in my road, and if I did not take a turning\r\nnow I would be forever bound to follow the track I was on. A foolish\r\ndesperation, I know, but the oncoming move to the wilderness of North Elba\r\nfrightened me.",
    " We had begun dismantling and packing up our life in Springfield,\r\nalmost without having yet settled there, and the house was filling with crates\r\nand cartons, and Father was making lists of goods and tools and was negotiating\r\nfor a large wagon to carry everything north. That very evening he had informed\r\nme over our supper that my job would be to take the boys Salmon and Watson\r\nout to Litchfield, Connecticut, where he had been boarding his merino sheep and\r\nsmall herd of Devon cattle at the farm of a cousin, there to gather the livestock\r\nand move them north separately from the rest of the family, to meet up in the\r\ntown of Westport, New York, on Lake Champlain.\r\nI nodded and, on getting up from the table, sullenly announced that I would be\r\ngoing out to say goodbye to a few friends, since I did not expect to see them\r\nagain. Father showed no interest in my stated intentions: I did not know, of\r\ncourse, thanks to my inane self-absorption, that his mind and the minds of\r\neveryone else in the family were very much distracted by the worsening\r\ncondition of the sick baby, Ellen. It appeared to me that, but for our preparations\r\nto move, life was going on as usual. Except, as I saw it, no one particularly cared\r\nabout me. So deluded was I that I had grown angry at them, at Father especially,\r\nfor not having asked me pointedly where I was going, who were my friends, why\r\ndid I need to tell them goodbye with two weeks yet to go before we left town?\r\nFor not having caught my lie.\r\nIn a huff, then, and puffed up with self-righteous relief, I left the crowded little\r\nhouse on Franklin Street and made my way downtown towards the dark, broad\r\nConnecticut River, where barges and sloops and Long Island coasters tied up at\r\nthe docks, and their crews and the stevedores gathered in dim, smoky taverns.",
    " In\r\nand around these taverns and boarding houses there were women—women\r\nwaiting for the company and pay of lonely men and boys who came ashore for a\r\nnight or two, women waiting for the drovers and woodcutters from the hills of\r\nVermont and New Hampshire to come in from the marketplaces of the town with\r\nfresh money in their pockets and reckless intentions in their hearts.\r\nWomen, women, women! The mere idea of femaleness made me mad with\r\ndesire, although I knew not what it was exactly that I desired. Sex? Copulation?\r\nSimple, carnal love? All that, I suppose. All that. The very fact of it. But\r\nsomething else, too. I craved knowledge, knowledge of a sort that up to then I’d\r\nhad no access to, and here I speak of the certain and unmistakeable smell of a\r\nwoman, the touch of her soft skin, the flow of her hair across my hand, the\r\nsound of a woman’s whispered voice in my ear, even the sight of her naked\r\nbody. What were these smells, touches, sounds, and sights like? I had never\r\nexperienced these aspects of femaleness. But I knew they existed, and that small\r\nknowledge made me wildly desirous of the further, larger, and much more\r\ndangerous knowledge beyond.\r\nIt was a warm night, the April air thick with the smell of lilacs and new, wet\r\ngrass. I strode along, determined tonight not to leave this river town without\r\nlearning at least something of what I was sure I would miss afterwards—for the\r\nremainder of my life, as it seemed. For I still believed the Old Man then,\r\nbelieved him when he said that our move up into the Adirondack wilderness of\r\nnorthern New York would be permanent. And had accepted that, because of the\r\nblacks settled there, Timbuctoo would be our base for all future operations in the\r\nwar against slavery.",
    " I was sure that my permanent, lifelong job would be to run\r\nthe farm and tend the flocks, so that Father could preach and organize and fight,\r\nactivities to which his character and temperament were so much more neatly\r\nadapted than mine. I felt that I had reached the end of a conscripted childhood\r\nand was about to begin a similarly conscripted adult life. But on this April night,\r\nfor a few hours, at least, I meant to be a free man.\r\nI saw several women and avoided passing each one by crossing the street to\r\nthe other side. But then came one I could not avoid, and after I had passed her\r\nby with my habitually averted gaze, she called out, “Hullo, Red! Would y’ be\r\nneedin’ company tonight?”\r\nShe was a girl, practically, I had glimpsed that much, and red-haired herself,\r\nperhaps fourteen or fifteen years old, with bright white powder all over her face\r\nand a broad slash of painted lips and smudge-blackened eyes. She wore erratic\r\nscraps of cloth elaborately draped across her shoulders, wrapped, sashed, and\r\npinned so as to suggest an exotic gown, although it was more a child’s motley\r\ncostume than a woman’s dress.\r\nI stopped and turned back to her, and she said, with a curl to her voice and a\r\npronunciation that was noticeably Irish, “You’re a big feller, ain’t you, now.”\r\nBecause I could see that she was a child, she did not frighten me as a full-\r\ngrown woman would, and I took a step towards her. “I’m ... I’m only out for a\r\nwalk,” I said. She was small and thin. Her head, covered with a crumpled black\r\nlace bonnet, came barely to my chest, the thickness of her wrist seemed not\r\nmuch greater than that of my thumb, and her waist was smaller than the\r\ncircumference of my right arm.\r\nWhen I approached her, she stopped smiling and stepped back from me into a\r\nbank of shadows that fell from a cut-stone retaining wall.",
    " We were down by the\r\ncanal tow path, with the river passing in the darkness below and a cobbled street\r\nout of view above. I heard a horse clop past and the iron-sheathed wheels of a\r\nwagon. It was a lonely, dark, and dangerous place for a girl, even a girl such as\r\nshe—perhaps especially for one such as she, whose purpose for being there was\r\nto solicit the attentions of men likely to be drunk or angry, men likely to regard\r\nher as disposable. More particularly, of course, she was there to solicit men like\r\nme—timid, passionately curious bumpkins, who would pay to use her, yes, but\r\nwould not otherwise harm her.\r\nI was useless to her, however, a waste of her time, for I had no more than a\r\nfew loose coins in my pocket. Father, I thought, with more coins in his pocket\r\nthan I, would try to save such a woman. He would lecture her on the evils of her\r\nways and give her his last money and instruct her to go home and feed herself\r\nand her babes, if she had any. John and Jason were both recently married and,\r\neven if they had been as unattached as I, would have done likewise. I knew that\r\nI, however, had I the means, would only try to use her. I am confident that\r\nFather never in his life performed the sexual act outside the matrimonial bed\r\n(where, to be sure, he performed it frequently); the same for my brothers; but I,\r\nby contrast, even at the young age of twenty-four, still and perhaps forever too\r\nmuch the son and brother, could not imagine myself as husband, as father, as\r\nregular visitor to the marriage bed. And so here I was, where my father and\r\nbrothers would never be, soliciting a prostitute.\r\nThough I was a full-grown man, I wore my manhood like an ill-fitting costume\r\n—not unlike the way the girl before me wore her make-up and rags, her\r\nwoman’s costume. We had met in the shadows of a high stone wall, two children\r\nineptly disguised as adults.",
    " But where she had costumed herself as a grown\r\nwoman in order to keep from starving or freezing to death, I was a child got up\r\nmerely to accommodate the size and appearance and the startling impulses of a\r\nman’s body. But I was probably no more successful at disguising my childishness\r\nthan she, and in a diminished sense, I, too, was in danger out here—a cull, easy\r\nprey to robbers, tricksters, confidence men and women, cutpurses and cutthroats\r\nof every stripe.\r\n“I... I have no money!’ I said to her.\r\n“Aw, come on, now, a nicely dressed feller like yourself?”\r\n“Yes. I live not far from here. I’m just walking, out for a walk... as I said. I... I\r\nlike to be by the river.”\r\n“Then what d’ you want with me?” She took a further, backwards step into the\r\ndeeper shadows, and I could not make out her powdered and painted face any\r\nlonger.\r\n“Nothing. Nothing. Just... I’m sorry, miss. I didn’t mean to scare you.”\r\n“You didn’t scare me.”\r\n“No?” I moved towards her, and she jumped awkwardly away, like a broken-\r\nwinged bird, her parti-colored feathers all dusty and awry. I reached out with\r\nmy right hand and placed it on her bony shoulder. Instantly, she ducked out\r\nfrom under it and turned her back to me, pressing herself against the cold stone\r\nwall.\r\n“I won’t hurt you,” I whispered.\r\n“You can’t touch me ‘less’n you pay.”\r\nI reached into my pocket and drew out the few coins that remained, a gratuity\r\nI had received the day before from a Lowell merchant who’d had me haul five\r\nhundred weight bales of wool to his cart-copper pennies, enough for a single loaf\r\nof bread, no more. “Here, this is all I’ve got.” Looking warily at me, she half\r\nturned and opened her tiny hand; I passed her the coins, and they disappeared\r\ninto her rags at once.",
    "\r\nI peered down at my feet, embarrassed and unsure of what to do next, and\r\nwhen I looked up again, the girl had slid down along the wall and was about to\r\nbolt. “Hey, where’re you off to!”\r\n“No place!” she said, alarmed, and stood stock-still, half hidden in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n“But you took my money!”\r\n“Y’ don’t get much for coppers, y’ know.”\r\n“But you were running off\r\n“I was only movin’ out of the walkway some. C’m’ere, an’ be nice, mister.\r\nDon’t fret none, I’ll give you some of what y’ want, darlin’. C’m’ere, now,” she\r\nsaid to me in a lulling tone, as if she were trying to calm a large, frightened\r\nanimal.\r\nI moved abruptly to her but did not dare touch her this time. I was not afraid\r\nof her so much as afraid of myself. If I touched her, I did not know what would\r\nfollow. Then, suddenly, it was she who had touched me. Her hand stroked me\r\nbetween my thighs, and a second later she was unbuttoning me, using both her\r\nhands. Before I could fully register what was happening, it was over: she was\r\nstanding and wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, a distant look on her\r\nface, as if she were calculating the few measly items that she might purchase\r\nwith the pennies I had given her.\r\nI turned away and quickly buttoned my trousers. “I... I’m sorry!’ I said, without\r\nlooking around at her.\r\n“What for?”\r\nI turned and faced her. She drew her shawl over her scrawny shoulders and\r\nseemed about to leave. “Well... that, I guess.”\r\n“You got what y’ paid for. No more.”\r\n“Yes, I know. You’re right. I just. .. well, it’s terribly wrong, that’s all. And I’m\r\nsorry for that.”\r\nShe shrugged and started off. “G’bye, dearie. Come back when you get your\r\nwages.”\r\n“Wait!” I called. The girl stopped a few paces off, and I ran up to her. “Don’t\r\ngo yet.”\r\nShe studied my face carefully, uncertain, a little curious, perhaps, but\r\nsomewhat frightened as well.\r\nI spoke softly.",
    " “I wonder... I was wondering if I might... look at you. I’m\r\nsorry... I thought, I wonder if you might let me see you.”\r\nShe cast a look at me aslant, then glanced up and down the walkway, as if\r\nseeking an escape route. “No. No looks. Y’ got what y’ paid for, mister.”\r\nWithout touching her, I placed my right hand and left forearm against the wall\r\non either side of her, trapping her in front of me. “I want only to look at you,” I\r\nsaid. “Just for a moment.”\r\n“Look at me? What do y’ mean? My bubbies y’ want to see?”\r\n“Yes. And the other.”\r\n“The other? Naw, you’re daft, mister. You’re makin’ me scared.” She had\r\ndrawn down and in close to herself and had wrapped her thin arms tightly\r\naround her chest, making her seem even more like a child than before. Her\r\nlarge, smudged eyes looked plaintively up at me. “Please... just let me go now,\r\nmister.”\r\n“First let me look at you. Then you can go. I won’t hurt you.”\r\n“Just my bubbies?”\r\n“Yes.”\r\n“Not the other?”\r\nNo.\r\nSlowly, she unwrapped her arms, reached under her shawl and fumbled\r\nmomentarily with the buttons of her frock, and then she drew the clothing aside\r\nand showed me herself—a bony pink chest with tiny breasts. The fragile,\r\ninnocent body of a child. For a second only, I stared, wishing suddenly that I\r\nwere as able as she to open my own shirt and bare my breast and have it be the\r\nbreast of a boy and not my thick, heavy-haired chest. So that, even as I\r\nhumiliated her, I frankly envied her—when at last I realized what I was doing\r\nand was shot through with shame and looked away.\r\nI waved my hands at her. “I’m sorry! Please forgive me” I said. “Please, cover\r\nyourself. I’m so sorry... to have done this to you,” I said. Then suddenly, not\r\nknowing what else to do, I got down on my knees before her and in silence hung\r\nmy head.\r\n“Well, you are some crack-brained cull, mister,” the girl said.",
    " She stepped\r\naround my prostrate form, and I heard her footsteps clack against the stone as\r\nshe made her escape. When I looked up, she was gone. I was alone in the\r\ndarkness. I heard the slosh of the river down below and the creak and groan of\r\nboats and barges bumping against the piers. On the street above, a pair of\r\ndrunken men walked past. One laughed, the other sang a bit of a bawdy song.\r\nHe who once a good name gets\r\nMay piss a-bed and say he sweats...\r\nThey both laughed and passed by. Alone in the night once again, I walked for\r\nhours after that, aimless, confused, frightened by the appalling knowledge I had\r\nobtained—not knowledge of women in general or of the particular poor,\r\nnameless Irish girl whom, for a few pennies, I had used as a common whore, but\r\nknowledge of myself. I knew myself now to be vile, a beast. On my own like this,\r\naway from Father and the rest of the family, cut loose from their moral and\r\nintellectual clarity, from the virtue generated, sustained, and perfected among\r\nthem, I was but a sack of contradictions and unpredictable impulses: I was a boy\r\nlocked inside a maris body, my childish innocence contaminated now, not\r\nmerely by longing and self-abuse, but by sexual contact of the most disgusting\r\nsort. I had inflicted myself upon a poor, pathetic street urchin, a whore, yes, but\r\na person who, compared to me, was honest, was virtuous—was innocent. Once\r\nagain, I envied her, and at that moment would have happily exchanged places\r\nwith her, if for no other reason than properly to punish myself for my\r\ntransgressions and my hypocrisy and to reward her for her virtue and suffering.",
    "\r\nIt should be she, not I, who could freely return to a warm household filled\r\nwith a loving and upright family; she, not I, who was able to stand alongside her\r\nfather and mother and brothers and sisters in church and public meetings and to\r\nwalk freely about the town in the daylight glow of respect and admiration from\r\nthe citizenry; she, not I, who performed honest labor and received for it shelter,\r\nfood, clothing; she, not I, whose father, guide, and protector was the good man\r\nJohn Brown. Let me be the harlot, the hired property of drunken, brutal\r\nstrangers. Let me go hungry and cold through the nighttime alleyways and dark\r\ncorners of the town, exchanging brief, obscene gratifications for a few pennies.\r\nLet me be the victim.\r\nBurdened with thoughts such as these, I slowly made my sorrowful way home to\r\nFranklin Street, arriving there sometime in the middle of the night. The house\r\nwas not darkened, as I had expected, and when I entered I was greeted by Ruth\r\nand John and Wealthy, all in their nightclothes, gathered together in the kitchen\r\ncomforting our stepmother, Mary, who sat downcast at the table with a bowl of\r\nwarm milk before her. She had been weeping, I saw at once, and when I asked\r\nwhat had happened, John turned to me and swiftly took me aside and informed\r\nme that the baby Ellen had died just minutes before. It was a mercy, he said, for\r\nthe poor little thing had not drawn a proper breath for hours. Father was still\r\nwith her upstairs, and he could not be separated from the infant. “It’s as if he\r\ncannot believe her dead,” John said. Mother—for he, unlike me, called her that\r\n—Mother was all right now. She had accepted the death of the child as an\r\ninevitable thing the previous evening, although Father had not, and she had\r\nprayed for her to go as quickly and painlessly as possible.",
    " But Father had stayed\r\nup two whole nights with the babe in his arms, believing that he could somehow\r\nsave her, even, at the end, trying to breathe into her mouth. But she had died in\r\nhis arms, and he had refused to lay her down and now was walking up and down\r\nin the rooms above, still praying for her recovery.\r\nI remember John saying, “The Old Man can’t seem to let this one go.” And I\r\nremember that he did not ask me where I had been until this late hour. No one\r\nasked. Clearly, and rightly, my private adventures and torment were of no\r\naccount here.\r\nSuddenly, there was Father at the bottom of the back stairs, entering the\r\nkitchen, his arms hanging down at his sides, his head lowered, with tears\r\nstreaming down his face. I had never seen Father weep before, and the sight\r\nastonished and frightened me. He sat himself down next to his wife with a\r\ngroping hesitancy, as if he had lost his sight, and he placed his hands against his\r\nface and wept openly as a child. No one said a word. This was beyond our\r\nunderstanding. I do not think that Father loved any one of his children more\r\nthan the others, and he had lost at that time fully half a dozen of his babes, and\r\nhe had not wept over any of them, although, to be sure, he had grieved deeply\r\nover them all, even to despair. His belief in the Life Hereafter had always been\r\nsufficiently strong that he could view their early going as a gift from God for the\r\nchildren and a trial from God for him. But somehow this was different. It was as\r\nif this time he believed that he, the father of the child, was being punished, not\r\ntried, by her death. “The Lord is filled with wrath against me!” he cried. ‘The\r\nLord despiseth me!”\r\n“No, no, Father,” we all said, and each in his own way tried to console him.\r\nWe reached out to him and placed our hands on him, and several of us wept\r\nwith him. Although I did not. I could not.",
    " I backed off a ways and watched in\r\nshame, for I knew the true cause of Father’s suffering, over and above his grief\r\nfor the lost child. I was the cause. I knew that Father was blaming himself for my\r\nsins, condemning himself for not having interceded with me in my frequent\r\nlustful wanderings, which surely he had observed and marked. And now he\r\nbelieved that he was being punished by an angry God for his inattention. I did\r\nnot need to hear Father say any of this; I knew it in my bones.\r\nSlowly, I came forward, and the others, as if they knew what I intended,\r\nparted for me and made room for me to go down on my knees beside Father’s\r\nchair. “I’m sorry, Father, for what I’ve done. I have sinned, and I am sorry.\r\nPlease, Father, please forgive me.”\r\nAt that, he ceased weeping and looked straight into my face. His great gray\r\neyes penetrated my face to my very soul, and he did not flinch at what he saw\r\nthere, and I did not squirm away from his gaze, much as I wanted to. “Owen, my\r\nson. You are a good boy, Owen. I forgive thee,” he said in a low voice, and he\r\nplaced his hands on my shoulders and drew me to him. “The Lord hath taken\r\none child from me and returned to me another, who was lost,” he said. “I\r\nwelcome thee, Owen,” he said, and it was as if his words had cleansed me, for at\r\nonce I felt uplifted and strong again. Whatever Father wished me now to do, I\r\nwould do without argument, without hesitancy, without fear. I remember, on the\r\nnight that the baby Ellen died, thinking that.\r\nII\r\nChapter 5\r\nI don’t know how much time has passed since I began this account—days,\r\nweeks, a fortnight—for it is as if I have been elsewhere, a place where time is\r\nmeasured differently and space is not bounded as it is usually.",
    " The only thing\r\nthat grounds me, that stills and locks me into some deliberate measure of time\r\nand place, is my intermittent awareness of you, holding these sheets of paper in\r\nyour hands, reading my words, learning my story and applying it to Father’s\r\nlarger story, the one that truly matters.\r\nI know that in passing, due to my self-absorption and to the vividness of my\r\nrecollections, I have mentioned many people and events that you know little of,\r\nthat you may in fact know nothing of, for they have not come down in the\r\nhistorical record. They are not a part of the received truth. It is important that\r\nyou hear of them, however, for they, like me, are figures in the context of\r\nFather’s story, which, if he is to be known at all, must be known as well. Let me\r\nspeak, for instance, of Lyman Epps, the Negro man whom I mentioned earlier,\r\nand let me say how we came to know Lyman, how I first came to know him, for\r\nhe will figure in the larger context of known people and events in a significant\r\nway. And his story, unlike the story of the men buried beneath Father’s stone in\r\nthe shade of Mount Tahawus, has not been told before by anyone.\r\nIt was in the spring of ’50, almost a half century ago, that I met Lyman Epps,\r\nwhen we all first came to North Elba, a few weeks later in the season than now,\r\nand I can bring it back to my mind today as if I were dreaming it—I can see the\r\nlilacs blooming and the bloodroot, which I had not seen before, at least not to\r\nname.\r\nIt might have been earlier than now—the first of May, perhaps.",
    " For the lilacs\r\nthat I am gazing at were located in the trim yards of the houses down in\r\nWestport, New York, alongside the broad verandas that faced the glittering\r\nwaters of Lake Champlain and the Green Mountains of Vermont on the further\r\nside; and when Father pointed out the little, low blossom of the bloodroot, we\r\nwere still down in that prosperous village, gathering the family and our livestock\r\nto begin our trek up into the mountains, where it would not be warm enough for\r\nthe bloodroot and the lilacs to bloom until many weeks later.\r\nFather and I had moved his horse, Dan, and the seven head of Devon cattle\r\naway from where we had camped, on a hillside clearing at the edge of town,\r\nintending to water the animals at a stream nearby. The boys Watson, Salmon,\r\nand Oliver, setting out the sheep to graze, had located the stream earlier. The\r\nOld Man halted suddenly, and I peered over the bony red rumps and heads of\r\nour thirsty beasts to see what was the matter.\r\n“Owen, come, look here;” he commanded.\r\nI passed by the cattle to where he stood staring intently down the embankment\r\ninto a glade beside the rock-strewn stream, which was narrow here and tumbled\r\nfast downhill towards the lake. I looked where he had indicated and, as was so\r\noften the case, saw nothing. Black flies swarmed about my face, and the cattle\r\nbunched up impatiently behind us. Father held old Dan, his chestnut gelding, by\r\nthe halter and peered into the glade.\r\n“Yes, well, if we needed a sign,” he said, with a certain resignation in his\r\nvoice, “here is one.” In profile, Father’s unsmiling, clean-shaven face was like a\r\nfist. He had a tight mouth with thin lips, a square chin and forehead, and a\r\nhooked, short nose, a hawk’s beak.",
    " You may be unaware that the long beard,\r\nwith which he was later so often and so famously pictured, he wore only after\r\nKansas, as a disguise, and, indeed, it did disguise him, even to his family, who\r\nfondly remembered his daily morning shave, mirrorless by the stove. It was an\r\noccasion for us to tease him into almost nicking himself with the razor. “You\r\nmissed a bit,” one of us, usually Ruth, would calmly observe.\r\nA second child, Oliver or Salmon, would add, “Over here, Father, near your\r\nbig left ear.” His ears were unusually large, and to our amusement, their size\r\nslightly embarrassed him; although he denied it, of course.\r\n“Where?” he would ask, groping over his heavy jaw with his fingertips.\r\n“The other side! On the other side!”\r\n“The right side, just below your enormous right ear!”\r\n“No, it’s the left. His right, Oliver, is your left.”\r\nFather would himself grow amused and join the game by feigning frantic\r\nconfusion and flashing his long razor recklessly like a saber from one side of his\r\nface to the other. “Here? Here? Here?” Until Ruth or I or Mary would seriously\r\nfear that he was about to cut himself and would say, “Enough. Let the poor man\r\nshave his face in peace,” and the children would disperse, and Father, smiling\r\nlightly, would finish and wipe his face dry.\r\n“It’s the May flower” he said to me that morning in Westport. “The bloodroot,\r\nwe called it, when I was a boy.” Following his extended finger, I looked down by\r\nthe stream and saw in amongst the ferns and mossy stones a cluster of small\r\nwhite flowers near the ground. “The root is red as fresh blood,” he said, and told\r\nme that the Iroquois used it as pigmentation for their war paint. “The petals,\r\nthough, they come pure white, like those yonder. Innocent above ground, and\r\nbloody below,” he mused. He had known it to grow and even blossom under a\r\nlayer of late snow.",
    " It was the first flower of spring, and he was truly glad to see\r\nit.\r\nOne of the cows smelled the water and started over the embankment, and the\r\nrest pulled over behind her, and quickly I stepped around in front of the leader\r\nand shoved her back.\r\n“After such tribulation, we may well require a hopeful sign,” Father said,\r\nmeaning the past winter’s long, lingering death of the infant Ellen, I supposed,\r\nand all his financial woes, which had continued to mount so relentlessly in the\r\nlast few years.\r\nIt was strange to feel sorry for Father, and I rarely did and was almost\r\nashamed of the feeling, as if he had forbidden it. Regardless, I placed my hand\r\non his shoulder and said to him, “The Lord will provide, Father.” But the words\r\nfelt like gravel in my mouth.\r\n“Owen, don’t say words that you don’t believe. Not even in comfort,” he\r\nadded, and he scowled and turned away and led old Dan and the cattle further\r\nup the hill to where the stream ran slowly and there was a shallow pool that the\r\nanimals could drink from.\r\nYet, all in all, it was a very pleasant few days, that first stop in Westport, and I\r\nalmost wished that we could settle there, instead of trekking on to a place that\r\neveryone other than Father had described as a howling wilderness. During the\r\nlast year-and-a-half in Springfield, helping Father and John run Father’s and Mr.\r\nSimon Perkins’s wool business, I had grown somewhat used to the easy\r\nsociability and abundant distractions of a town. I somewhat envied John for\r\nhaving been left behind, even though he was burdened with looking after\r\nFather’s affairs at the warehouse, and I envied Jason, too, and even Fred, who\r\nwas a full six years younger than I, for having been charged with the care of Mr.\r\nPerkins’s flocks back at Mutton Hill in Akron.\r\nBut there was no arguing with Father on this matter of our settling amongst\r\nthe Negroes in North Elba.",
    " He was dead set on it. They were freedmen, a few\r\nwere doubtless fugitives, and the wealthy New York abolitionist Mr. Gerrit\r\nSmith, out of simple compassion and generosity, but perhaps with a useful moral\r\npoint to make as well, had deeded them forty acres per family from his vast\r\nholdings in the Adirondacks. But in a few short years the rigors of northcountry\r\nfarming had for the most part defeated them, and the little colony was coming\r\nrapidly undone. Father’s agreement with Mr. Smith was that in exchange for a\r\nsizeable piece of land with an abandoned house on it, to be paid for later at one\r\ndollar per acre, we would move there and teach the Negroes, many of whom had\r\nbeen Philadelphia barbers and Long Island shoemakers and the such, how to\r\norganize and work their land.\r\nFather did not think he could accomplish this without at least one adult son\r\nbeside him and had carefully explained why I was the one so designated: John\r\nwas more capable than I when it came to business; Jason and his new wife were\r\nsettled permanently, it seemed, in Ohio; and Fred, although twenty years old\r\nthen, was a person who needed close supervision, which Jason was good at\r\nproviding. As usual, the Old Man was right, and I had to comply.\r\nThe first thing we needed to do was survey and validate their claims, he told\r\nme: to keep the Negroes from being cheated by the whites, who had been\r\nsquatting up there for several generations—ever since the terrible, year-long\r\nwinter of ’06 had driven most of the original settlers out—and had come to think\r\nof the whole place as theirs alone.",
    " Father’s motives were moral and idealistic,\r\nthe same as had always prompted his political actions, and he described this\r\nmove as essentially political—for he had visited North Elba alone the previous\r\nfall and had come away newly inspired by a vision of Negro and white farmers\r\nworking peacefully together. His hope now, he explained to us, was to build a\r\ntrue American city on a hill that would give the lie to every skeptic in the land.\r\nThere were many such Utopian schemes and projects afoot in those years, a\r\nhundred little cities on a hundred little hills, but Timbuctoo may have been the\r\nonly one that aimed at setting an example of racial harmony. This would be our\r\nerrand into the wilderness, he said.\r\nBut there was more to it than that. The wild Adirondack landscape had moved\r\nthe Old Man wonderfully. All that winter and spring, despite the worry and grief\r\nhe bore over the sickness and long dying of the baby Ellen, whenever he spoke\r\nof settling down on the broad tableland between the mountains, his face would\r\nsoften and flush, and he would sail off in reveries and fantasies more likely to\r\nhave been generated by a short stay at Valhalla than by a quick visit to a tract of\r\nhardscrabble highlands with a ninety-day growing season and a grinding, six-\r\nmonths-long winter. “Ah, Owen,” he would exclaim, “just wait until you see the\r\nbeauty of this place! It makes you think that during the Creation the good Lord\r\nLingered there awhile. There is truly no place I have seen whose aspect has so\r\npleased me as those Adirondack mountains.”\r\nOn reflection, I believe, also, that there was for Father yet another deeply\r\npleasing aspect of the North Elba project, one that he hid from us then but which\r\nI understood later. Its force was stronger than the moral point that he and Mr.",
    "\r\nGerrit Smith wished to make and more substantive than the poetic effect of the\r\nlandscape on his soul. For many years, the Old Man’s life had been cruelly\r\ndivided between his anti-slavery actions and his responsibilities as a husband\r\nand father, and despite his unrelenting, sometimes wild and chaotic attempts to\r\nunite them, it was often as if he was trying to live the lives of two separate men:\r\none an abolitionist firebrand, a public figure whose most satisfying and\r\nimportant acts, out of necessity, were done in secret; the other a good Christian\r\nhusband and father, a private man whose most satisfying and important acts\r\nwere manifested in the visible security and comfort of his family. He was a man\r\nwho had pledged his life to bring about the permanent and complete liberation\r\nof the Negro slaves; and he was the head of a large household with no easy\r\nsources of income.\r\nNever having married, I did not experience this sort of division in my life,\r\nwhich is perhaps why it took me until I was practically middle-aged before I was\r\nled to these particular sympathies for Father. And I certainly had no inkling of\r\nhis conflicted state back then, when I reluctantly agreed to join him in his\r\nremoval of the family from Springfield to North Elba, the tenth move in nearly\r\nas many years. Now, however, I can see that, for the first time in his life, Father\r\nexpected to live as what he regarded as a whole man. In the Adirondacks,\r\namongst the Negroes, he had at last imagined a life that was capable of\r\ncontaining all his contraries. Or so he believed then.\r\nFather turned fifty that spring; Mary was thirty-seven. I am sure that, despite\r\nall, Father’s errand into the wilderness pleased her, especially after the death of\r\nthe baby Ellen.",
    " It was a fresh start, and Father’s reveries and fantasies about the\r\nplace had convinced her that our life would finally be calm and organized. Mary\r\nwas a profound and prayerful person, more meditative and inward than the Old\r\nMan and most of the rest of us, and the idea of making a sanctuary in the\r\nmountains pleased her, especially if it met the Old Man’s standards for his and\r\nour participation in the struggle to free the slaves. And as far as she and we\r\nknew then, the removal to North Elba would accomplish that.\r\nI remember him reassuring her that in a year or even less he would tie up his\r\ntangled affairs with Mr. Perkins in Springfield and Ohio and have all his debts at\r\nlast paid off. Then he would be free to build his racially harmonious city on the\r\nhill, raise his prize-winning cattle and sheep on the slopes of the Adirondacks,\r\nand live out his years in the comfort of his family and neighbors. He would be a\r\npreacher, a teacher, and a farmer, he said. It was all he had ever wanted in life.\r\nHe did not want to be a great man.\r\nHe told her that, told it to all of us, and we believed it, and I’m sure that,\r\nsometimes, he believed it, too. I soon learned, of course, that months before,\r\nwhen he had gone to North Elba alone, he had had other things in mind—the\r\nscattered, dimly formed, but powerful beginnings of ideas and plans that would\r\ndevelop and coalesce up there in the mountains and that would eventually prove\r\nirresistible to him. And, I confess it, ideas and plans that would prove irresistible\r\nto me and to my brothers as well.",
    "\r\nTo get to Westport, the boys Watson and Salmon, who were but fourteen and\r\nthirteen years old that spring, and I had traveled separately from the others, for\r\nwe had brought Father’s Devon cattle and his five Spanish merino sheep up\r\nalong the Connecticut River from Litchfield, Connecticut, where Father had been\r\nboarding them, crossed overland to Rutland, Vermont, and passed around the\r\nbottom of Lake Champlain to the New York side by the Fort Ticonderoga route.\r\nThe Old Man, Mary, sister Ruth, and the younger children, Oliver, Annie, and\r\nlittle Sarah, at three years old the second to bear that name, had come north\r\nfrom Springfield in the wagon with all our tools and domestic goods, a pig, some\r\nfowl, and our dogs. They had crossed the lake on the ferry from Vermont,\r\narrived in Westport, New York, and set up camp a few days before we got there.\r\nBy the time we showed up with the cattle and sheep, Father had already\r\npurchased the supplies we would need to see us through to our first harvest, but\r\nas soon as I saw the size of the load, I knew that Father’s old horse, an animal\r\nfor whom he had typically developed an intense affection, would prove too\r\nfeeble to haul it on the flats, let alone over high mountains. The Old Man and I\r\nargued a bit over that one, but he relented, for he knew the difficulties of getting\r\nup from Lake Champlain to North Elba even better than I.\r\nWith regret, then, he decided to sell his precious old horse, Dan, and use his\r\nlast remaining cash money to buy a team from the shipping agent in Westport, a\r\nMr. Thurston Clarke. As it turned out, Mr. Clarke offered Father a chance to hold\r\non to his money, or most of it, which would have made a useful difference to\r\nhim later on, but the Old Man gave it over.",
    " The red-coated Devon cattle had\r\naroused considerable admiration among the local people there, and Father was\r\nbriefly tempted by Mr. Clarke to swap a pair straight across for a team of\r\nNarragansetts. At the last minute, Father declined the offer.\r\nThe reason was the presence of a black man from North Elba—Lyman Epps.\r\nMister Epps, as Father always addressed him, to the frequent consternation of\r\nany white people who were present. The man wandered into our camp south of\r\nWestport the evening of the day after the boys and I had arrived from\r\nConnecticut with the cattle and the sheep, and he swiftly proved to be an\r\nintelligent, charming man, although I confess that I did not warm to him as\r\nquickly as did the others. A wiry, coal-black fellow of medium height and quick\r\nmovements, he was one of Gerrit Smith’s settled freedmen, a well-spoken man in\r\nhis early thirties, I guessed, who had been a blacksmith in Maryland and knew\r\nhorses. Many men know horses, but only from the outside; Mr. Epps claimed to\r\nunderstand them from the inside, as if they were people.\r\nHe told us that he had come down to Westport from North Elba in search of\r\nwork: he needed cash to buy seed, because his crops from the previous year had\r\nfailed, and all his reserves were gone, and he had no more credit at the feed\r\nstores or suppliers in the area. But he had been turned away by every blacksmith\r\nand harrier in the village, due to his race. In the process, however, he had\r\nlearned of Father’s presence in town—the abolitionist fool from Ohio bent on\r\nteaching Gerrit Smith’s niggers to farm in the mountains. Father, as usual, had\r\nmade no secret of our intentions, and we, like the Negroes, had quickly become\r\nsomething of a local joke.\r\nOn the subject of horses, the man was positively brilliant, or I should say he\r\ntalked brilliantly on the subject.",
    " Such talk pleased the Old Man immensely and\r\nprobably caused him to disregard the man’s occasional gaps in knowledge and\r\nexperience, for soon he was inviting Mr. Epps to advise him on the purchase of a\r\nnew team.\r\nWhile Father’s own knowledge of horses was not nearly as extensive and deep\r\nas with cattle and sheep, where he truly was an expert, he nonetheless,\r\nunsurprisingly, held strong and frequently voiced opinions as to the relative\r\nmerits of the more popular breeds. Also, he rarely exhibited any particular\r\nreluctance to lecture folks on how to raise, train, work, and ride horses. He took\r\nadvice badly but gave it without stint. Back in Ohio, when we were still living on\r\nthe old Haymaker farm and Father was first slipping deeply into land\r\nspeculation, he had expanded his livestock operation beyond sheep and cattle\r\nand had even raised racehorses for a few years and sold off the colts and\r\nyearlings at the nearby Warren racetrack.\r\nI remember his lectures to us, for we older boys were obliged to care for the\r\ncolts and break them to the saddle and so on, before they could be sold off.\r\n“Remember, a colt should never be frightened,” he insisted. “Never. Horses are\r\nsensitive beings, very intelligent, easily spooked, so they must be treated with\r\ngentleness.” Later on, he explained, when you want to bring them under your\r\ncontrol, they will trust your intentions completely and will defer to you in all\r\nthings.\r\nThis was not, of course, his philosophy with regard to raising children.\r\nChildren, the Old Man believed, were innately sinful, and thus they could be\r\nbroken to the saddle, as it were, only if regularly disciplined and controlled by\r\nthe rod, and could be saved only by the mysterious dispensation of the Lord’s\r\ngrace. For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He\r\nreceiveth, he said.",
    " The blueness of a wound deanseth away evil; so do stripes the\r\ninward part of the belly. And, Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul\r\nspare for his crying. Horses were evidently already saved, or were at least free of\r\nsin, and who could argue with that?\r\nI did sometimes wish, however, that he had applied his views on raising\r\nanimals to his methods of raising children. Foals, Father told us, should learn the\r\nuse of a halter very early, with nothing but a gentle touch and voice, and you\r\nmust break them in to reins slowly and much later, after they have grown easy\r\nwith the halter. His lectures on the use of the bit and the importance of a soft\r\nmouth were impressive, and in demonstrating the process of introducing the bit,\r\nhe handled the animal with such delicacy and affection that you almost wished\r\nthat you yourself were the foal.\r\nWith all livestock, Father was a gentle man who clearly loved to touch and\r\nstroke the flesh of the animal, to examine and, if the animal was healthy and\r\nwell-formed, admire it and express almost motherly concern over any sign of\r\nillness or deformity. He would walk a yearling racehorse out of the barn and run\r\nhis hands over the withers and back, across the barrel of the animal and its\r\ngaskins, fetlocks, and pasterns, ending with an examination of the hooves,\r\nmaking sure that we had been listening when he last lectured us on the proper\r\ncare of a horse’s hoof.\r\nLike most men with a developed affection for animals, Father was an excellent\r\nrider, and not surprisingly, he enjoyed instructing us boys and anyone else who\r\nwould listen on the best methods of bringing your horse to jump over fences or\r\nditches in the fields of the neighborhood and how to bring your horse quickly\r\ndown a steep slope without risking injury to the animal.",
    " And although, at the\r\ntime, my elder brothers and I were not especially eager to be taught yet again\r\nhow to do what we thought we already knew well enough, in later years, when\r\nwe were running for our lives in Kansas, leaping streams and gullies in the dark\r\nand crashing through dense copses of cottonwoods, obliging the slavers to stop,\r\nback off, muzzle around, and finally give up the chase, I remembered Father’s\r\nlectures and theories, his endless repetitions of what then seemed but practice\r\nfor a steeplechase we never intended to enter, and I was glad for having endured\r\nthem.\r\nThat evening at the camp in Westport, Mr. Epps flicked his nervy attention\r\nfrom one of us to the next with no apparent purpose, as if he were sorting out\r\nour family’s internal relations, trying to discern which of us bore influence over\r\nthe others, so as to learn whose good opinion would permit him to gain the favor\r\nof all.\r\nWas it the children? He first tried chatting up baby Sarah and strange little\r\nAnnie, whose bluntness seemed to delight him. “You’re a very black man, aren’t\r\nyou? Not all Negroes are as black as you,” she said straight out, and when no\r\none in the family scolded her, for she had merely uttered a simple truth and had\r\ndone so without racial prejudice, Mr. Epps laughed heartily at her words.\r\nOr was it one of the young boys in the camp, ten-year-old Oliver, or Salmon or\r\nWatson, who seemed to be in charge of the livestock, sturdy, young, high-\r\nspirited fellows eager to talk with the stranger and show him the virtues of their\r\nherd of handsome red cattle and the purebred ram and ewes? He made much of\r\nthe animals, shoving his hand deep into the fleeces and exclaiming loudly over\r\ntheir weight and density, but the rest of us merely watched and let the boys take\r\nhis compliments.",
    "\r\nOr maybe it was Ruth, the shy, calmly competent young woman who busied\r\nherself with the evening meal and kept her back to the man as much as possible,\r\nin spite of his pushing his animated face at her, first at one side, then the other,\r\ninterrupting her work with over-elaborated questions. “Now, tell me, Miss\r\nBrown,” he said to her, “who taught you so you come to possess such a\r\nknowledge, that you can cook this here panbread and pease porridge and so on,\r\nall by yourself out here on a big, open fire for such a large family of people?”\r\nWithout looking up, Ruth answered, “My mother,” and resumed her silence,\r\nwhich caused Mr. Epps to pay ornate compliments to Mary—knowing nothing,\r\nof course, of our true mother’s death eighteen years earlier, for it was she who\r\nhad taught Ruth to cook, not Mary. He rattled on just the same, as if our mother\r\nwere still alive.\r\nOr perhaps the person to ingratiate himself with was me, the redheaded young\r\nman whose left arm stayed bent as if permanently fixed that way, the tall fellow\r\nwho stood slightly off from the others, guarded and watchful, which I am sure is\r\nhow he viewed me that first time. But he did not seem to know how to address\r\nme, perhaps because I was closest to his age and a man and therefore would\r\nknow more easily than the others when he was playing the cheerful darkie and\r\nwhen he was sincere, although I could not.\r\nThere was the young woman whom the elder Mr. Brown had introduced as his\r\nwife, Mary, a pleasant, open-faced woman who looked twenty or more years\r\nyounger than her husband, eager to make the visitor comfortable. He tried her,\r\nbut saw in a moment that she intended to deflect his every inquiry and\r\nobservation by referring him straight to her husband, the hatchet-faced man\r\nfrom whom the tall young fellow had evidently got his red hair and gray eyes.",
    "\r\nAll right, then, he would chat up the Old Man himself, jabber with him awhile\r\nabout horseflesh, for that was what he was concerned about this evening, and it\r\nwas a subject on which Mr. Epps considered himself capable of sounding like an\r\nexpert. And, at least to Father, he did so.\r\nHe was not especially religious, I noted, for he, as did I, kept one eye open and\r\non the food while Father prayed over it. He loudly exclaimed “A-men!” when\r\nFather finished, and ate like a man who had not sat down to a proper meal in a\r\nweek, which was probably the case. The difficulties he had faced in these last\r\nfew days in Westport, importuning white strangers who scorned and spurned\r\nhim, came to my mind, and I began to feel sorry for the man and somewhat\r\nregretted my earlier disapproval. I continued, however, to retain a degree of\r\nskepticism as to his character.\r\nBy the time he left the camp that first night, Mr. Epps had arranged with\r\nFather to work as a teamster for us. “Ain’t no way to get a team pull that wagon\r\nover to North Elba without an experienced driver to discuss the subject with\r\nthem;” he said. “Them mountains scares animals all the way to sick and lazy.”\r\nI’m sure the Old Man believed that I, or he himself, was quite capable of\r\ndriving a team to North Elba, but he admired Mr. Epps’s pluck and self-\r\nconfidence and agreed to exchange some seed and other supplies for his services.\r\nNo doubt he wanted simply to help the man out.\r\nEarly the next morning, Father, Mr. Epps, and I, with the horse Dan in tow,\r\nshowed up at Mr. Clarke’s dockside stone warehouse, a barn-sized storage\r\nbuilding with a large stable attached, where he kept six or eight teams of horses\r\nand as many wagons, for he hauled freight all up and down the western shore of\r\nthe lake, from Port Henry to Port Kent and inland to Elizabethtown and even to\r\nNorth Elba.\r\nFather and Mr.",
    " Clarke, who was a bespectacled New Englander with a thin\r\nface and white chin-whiskers, quickly agreed on a price for old Dan. Then Mr.\r\nClarke tried to sell Father a handsome matched pair of Narragansetts, grays that\r\nseemed to be, as he claimed, healthy seven-year-olds. The price was reasonable,\r\nbut even with what he was being offered for Dan, it was more than Father had in\r\nhis possession.\r\nI could see the Old Man running down his inventory of possessions, wondering\r\nwhat he could sell to make up the difference. But then Mr. Epps stepped forward\r\nand in a clear voice said, “That ‘Gansett yonder spavined in both hocks and be\r\ndone in less than a year. The other one, Mister Brown, he ain’t got no heart at\r\nall. Narrow chest on him. You take them old Morgans in the back,” he advised.\r\n“The bays?” Mr. Clarke said, and he laughed. “Come on, Brown. They’re barely\r\nworth shoe-leather. Your nigger’s off his nut,” he said to Father.\r\nThe price for the Morgans, because of their age, was less than that for the\r\nNarragansetts, but still more than Father had in his pocket. Father said, “I\r\nbelieve I will take my friend’s advice!” and held out the money, all his money in\r\nthe world, I knew. “But you’ll have to take a few dollars less than what you’re\r\nasking, especially if, as you say, they’re not worth shoe-leather.”\r\nMr. Clarke did not want that. He shook his head and said, “Tell you what,\r\nMister Brown. You keep your money. And you can keep that old broken-down\r\ngelding of yours, too. Me, I don’t like to see a white man made a fool of by a\r\nnigger. So I’ll swap you even, the team of ’Gansetts for any one pair of those\r\nfancy cows you got. You can choose the cattle yourself Father hesitated a\r\nmoment. Morgans were not so famous then as they are now, especially outside\r\nthe state of Vermont, and neither Father nor I knew much about the breed. And,\r\nwhatever his reasons, Mr.",
    " Clarke’s eagerness to sell us the others did seem to our\r\nadvantage. But Father said, “No. I will sell you the gelding, sir, as we agreed,\r\nand if you’ll accept it, I will add to it what remaining cash I have for those bays,\r\nthe Morgans. As my friend here has advised me. And I will keep all my cattle.”\r\nI was not sure he was doing the wise thing, but knew better than to offer my\r\nopinion. The Old Man had made up his mind. To my eye, the Narragansetts were\r\ndefinitely the superior team and well worth the weakest pair of cattle from our\r\nherd. The transaction Mr. Clarke had proposed would have left us with five\r\ncattle, an excellent team of horses, old Dan, and sufficient cash to protect us\r\nagainst a weak harvest.\r\nFather said, “The bays, sir.”\r\nMr. Clarke gave Father a thin-lipped smile, took his money, and wrote out a\r\nbill of sale. Then he made Father sign a receipt for the horses. “Just so you don’t\r\nchange your mind, or tell folks I cheated you,” he said, and with no more words,\r\nhe retreated abruptly to his office.\r\n“Well, Mister Brown, you catched the man out,” Mr. Epps said, as we\r\nunhitched the small, weary-looking pair of Morgans and led them from the\r\ndarkness of the stable into the bright light of the yard outside, where their looks\r\ndid not improve. “Believe me, these bays going to carry you where you want to\r\ngo, and they still be drawing your plow across your field long after you gone.\r\nMake you a good saddle horse, too.”\r\nThe Old Maris eyes flashed with pleasure, and he clapped Mr. Epps on the\r\nback. “You know, Mister Epps, I love it when one of these racist Yankees hoists\r\nhimself like that!” he exclaimed, and laughed.\r\n“Yassuhr,” Mr. Epps quietly answered, and we drove the horses back to camp.\r\nShortly after dawn the next day, we departed Westport for North Elba.",
    " The sky, I\r\nremember, was cloudless and bright blue—one of those cool, dry northcountry\r\nmornings that let you see sharply all the way to the far horizon. Our teamster,\r\nMr. Epps, sat up on the box with Mary, who was feeling poorly. Little Sarah,\r\nwho was four that spring, settled herself happily between her mother and Mr.\r\nEpps. The rest of us walked, with Father and me out at the front of the team,\r\nwhile a short ways behind the wagon, Ruth walked hand-in-hand with seven-\r\nyear-old Annie, and the boys Watson, Salmon, and Oliver herded the sheep,\r\ncattle, and swine along at the rear. The horses, to my surprise, seemed\r\nuntroubled by the loaded wagon, and they responded quickly and smoothly to\r\nMr. Epps’s commands. Of course, we were still on a relatively flat, dry road and\r\nwould be for half the day, at least until we got to Elizabethtown, where the steep\r\nascent supposedly began.\r\nFather wanted us to leave Westport with dignity and evident seriousness of\r\npurpose—so as not to comfort any of the locals who might think us foolish or\r\npitiable, he explained. Consequently, we moved briskly, heads held high and\r\neyes squarely on the road before us, and kept the separate parts of our caravan\r\ndistinct from one another, as if we were a military parade passing in review. We\r\nwore jackets and waistcoats and hats, as usual, and the little girls and Ruth and\r\nMary wore mob hats and shawls over their shoulders, and their dark outer skirts\r\nwere appropriately long. Farmers leaned on their hoes, and women and children\r\ncame to their kitchen doors, to watch us as we passed out of the town and\r\nheaded northwest towards the first gentle hills of the interior.\r\nA few miles beyond the settlement, we came to a tilted, unpainted shanty that\r\nserved as a tollbooth and signaled the start of the new Northwest Road to\r\nElizabethtown, more cart track than road. A bar blocked our way.",
    " The Northwest\r\nRoad had been cut through the forest by a private company that had purchased\r\nthe narrow band of land on which it ran, so as to profit from the traffic.\r\nEvidently, Father had not anticipated this, for when he had made his only\r\nprevious journey to North Elba last fall, he’d come in from the lake at Port Kent\r\nby a somewhat more northerly route—through Ausable Forks and Wilmington\r\nNotch—with no toll road.\r\nAn old, grizzled fellow in floppy trousers and patchwork shirt emerged from\r\nthe shanty, hobbling on a badly constructed crutch—a veteran, to judge from his\r\nU.S. Army braces. He scrutinized our wagon and animals for a few seconds, spat\r\na brown stream of tobacco juice, and said to Father, “Cost you forty cents for the\r\nwagon and team. Cost you seventy cents for them there cows. The sheeps and\r\npigs can pass free.”\r\nFather drew himself up and said, “My friend, I have no money. We’re not\r\nhauling freight to sell at a profit. We’re a poor family on our way to settle a\r\npiece of land in North Elba.”\r\n“Don’t matter to me where you’re headed, mister. Or why. I charges by the\r\naxle and the hoof. Far’s I can see, you got two axles and at least nine sets of\r\nhoofs. I’m ignoring them sheeps and the pigs. You want to use this road, it’s\r\ngoing to cost you one dollar and ten cents, total.”\r\n“I’ll have to pay you on my return^’ Father said. “Can’t do that.”\r\n“And if I refuse to pay you now?”\r\nThis puzzled the old fellow. He gnashed his wad of tobacco and spat again.\r\n“Say what?”\r\nFather turned to me. “Remove the bar, Owen.”\r\nI walked over to the barked pole, which was laid into a pair of notched posts,\r\nlifted one end, and swung it away, clearing the road. The toll-taker, with Father\r\nblocking his approach to the bar, stared in disbelief. Immediately, Mr.",
    " Epps\r\nchucked to the horses and drove the wagon through, with Ruth and Annie\r\nfollowing somberly behind, and then came the cattle, driven by Watson and\r\nSalmon, and the sheep, driven by Oliver and the pair of dogs. Oliver wore a\r\nmischievous grin on his freckled face and waved at the toll-taker as he passed\r\nby.\r\nFather said to the old man, “I apologize for my son’s rudeness. He’s nine years\r\nold and should know better. And I give you my word, friend, on my next return\r\nto Westport, I’ll pay the toll.” Then he and I replaced the bar and hurried to\r\ncatch up to the others.\r\nAs Father strode past Oliver, he reached out and with the back of his hand\r\nstruck the boy a hard blow across his unsuspecting smile. “Never mock a man for\r\ndoing his duty!” he said, and without breaking his stride moved rapidly\r\nalongside me to our former position at the front.\r\nAfter a few moments, I glanced back over my shoulder and saw that Oliver’s\r\nface was bright red from the blow. He had turned his head to the side in an\r\nattempt to hide his tears, while the other boys stared straight on down the road,\r\npolitely averting their gaze.\r\nBack in Springfield, Father and I had fitted out the box of our wagon with a\r\nwhite canvas canopy stretched over a bent willow frame, for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the contents and shielding Mary and Ruth and the smaller children\r\nwhen it rained. Also, we intended the wagon to provide a little privacy and serve\r\nas sleeping quarters for the females. Until Westport, this had worked out fine,\r\nbut now, with so many supplies added to our household goods and tools,\r\npassengers were obliged to stay out on the open seat at the front with the driver,\r\nfor there was no room for anyone to sit or lie down under the canopy.",
    "\r\nWe had brought all of Father’s surveying tools with us, and his old tanning\r\nknives, spuds, and chisels, a small bark mill and various other implements and\r\nbasins retained from his tanning years, for, during his previous journey to the\r\nAdirondacks, the Old Man had observed plenty of hickory trees, both shagbarks\r\nand butternut, and he planned to set up a small tannery in North Elba and\r\nperhaps teach the trade to some of the Negro settlers. We had also packed into\r\nthe wagon our broadaxes, hatchets, adzes, hammers, wedges, and froes—tools\r\nthat we would need for clearing the overgrown land that Mr. Smith had deeded\r\nto Father. We carried a pair of grass scythes, a bull rake, hay forks, and reaping\r\nforks; we had a small hornhead anvil, various types of nails, jack hooks, and a\r\nfine oak tumbril sledge that Father himself had built one winter years ago back\r\nin Pennsylvania; we had braces and augers and a good pit saw, a bucksaw, and a\r\nhalf-dozen chisels and planes: we carried all the tools, or most of them anyway,\r\nthat the Old Man, in spite of bankruptcy and lawsuits, had accumulated and held\r\non to in his various homesteading ventures and numerous business operations in\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and Massachusetts.\r\nWe also carried our mattresses, bedding, and clothing, and the furniture that\r\nFather and Mary had brought out from the house in Ohio to Springfield the year\r\nbefore—a pair of small chests, Father’s writing table, Great-Grandfather Brown’s\r\nmantel clock, Mary’s spinning wheel, and Ruth’s loom; and all the cooking\r\nimplements and pots, the bowls, plates, mugs, and tableware; and, of course,\r\nFather’s big chest of books, which had traveled everywhere with us, from Ohio\r\nto Pennsylvania, back to Ohio and on to Springfield, and now to North Elba.",
    " To\r\nthese things, in Westport, we had added kegs of salt, flour, dried beef, corn,\r\ncrackers, seed, and feed for the animals, buckets for collecting and boiling down\r\nmaple sap, a washtub, extra harness, and a plow.\r\nAs a result of the great weight of these goods, the wagon creaked and groaned\r\non its axles. The spring mud had gone out early that year, fortunately, and the\r\nbig, iron-sheathed wheels ground down the stone and gravel of the track, as the\r\nteam of Morgans drew it slowly from the broad, greening valley of Lake\r\nChamplain to the upland, leafless forests and the freshly plowed fields and\r\ngardens of Elizabethtown.\r\nThe bays surprised me with their steadiness and strength, and my opinion of\r\nMr. Epps rose somewhat, as he eased the animals along in a calm and confident\r\nway, turning to his side now and then to chat with Sarah or inquiring into\r\nMary’s comfort or periodically informing us as to the names of the streams we\r\npassed and occasionally forded and the names of the snow-capped mountains\r\nthat slowly hove into view in the distance. “We coming along the Boquet River\r\nhere” Mr. Epps told us. “All the rivers up here flows north to Canada, Mister\r\nBrown. Them rivers and streams just like colored folks, you know, following the\r\ndrinking-gourd star. When folks running from slavery see the rivers start to flow\r\nnorth, they know they almost free,” he said. “And that snowy mountain in the\r\nwest called Giant of the Valley, and over there you can see the tip of Whiteface.\r\nCan’t see none of the truly high ones yet” he cheerfully informed us, although to\r\nmy flatlander’s eye Giant of the Valley and Whiteface seemed like towering Alps.",
    "\r\nWhen we entered the village of Elizabethtown—which was the seat of\r\ngovernment for Essex County and where, facing the commons, an imposing,\r\nwhite-columned brick courthouse was located—I observed that, off to the\r\nnorthwest, the sky was filling with dark clouds, and although the sun still shone\r\non us, I feared that it would soon rain.\r\nWe stopped on the commons for a rest and food and to water the animals at a\r\nlong wooden trough at the side of the road there. While Mr. Epps and the boys\r\ntended to the livestock and Ruth prepared our lunch of corn bread and molasses,\r\nFather and I rigged a cover over the driver’s seat of the wagon, so that Mary,\r\nwho was coughing and appeared to be suffering from the beginnings of ague,\r\nwould be protected from the weather.\r\nAfter we had eaten, Father strode off to the courthouse for a brief visit to the\r\noffice of the registrar of deeds, where, from a cursory examination of the public\r\nrolls, he determined, just as he had been told the previous fall by the folks in\r\nTimbuctoo, that longtime landholders and squatters in North Elba, white men,\r\nwere indeed claiming significant portions of the grants that Mr. Gerrit Smith had\r\nmade to the Negroes. Announcing summarily to the registrar that he intended\r\nvery soon to survey and to register the deeds for every one of Mr. Smith’s grants\r\nof land, the Old Man warned the fellow outright not to list any new lands on the\r\nEssex County tax rolls without a surveyor’s map and proper bill of sale and deed\r\nattached.\r\n“Judging from all the fancy brick houses I’ve seen hereabouts, I believe that\r\nthere are in this town more than a few lawyers who would be pleased to defend\r\nin a court of law the property rights of a free Negro, if they knew they were\r\ndefending as well the property rights of Mister Gerrit Smith” he warned the\r\nregistrar.",
    " “Mister Smith, as you of all people must know, is the single largest\r\ntaxpayer in this county!’ he added.\r\nDelighted, Father reported back to us that the man had received his\r\nannouncement with an open-mouthed, astonished gape that had made him look\r\nextremely foolish, even simple. He imitated the fellow, and we all—except Mr.\r\nEpps, I noticed—laughed uproariously, for Father rarely made faces, and he\r\nlooked quite comical when he did. Even Oliver laughed—although to himself he\r\nmight have observed that the fellow mocked by Father was no less of a man\r\ndoing his duty than had been the toll-taker. Inconsistency in small matters was\r\nnot something that any of us held against the Old Man however. In fact, we\r\nalmost welcomed it, for in the larger matters, where we, like most everyone else,\r\nturned weak and wobbly, he was like purified iron, of a piece and entirely\r\nconsistent, through and through.\r\nIt was close to an hour after noon when we departed from Elizabethtown,\r\nheading northwest through a thick forest of pines and balsam trees, and almost\r\nat once we moved steeply uphill, with a roaring brook crashing past us over\r\nhuge rocks from the heights to the village and farms spread out in the valley\r\nbelow. The sky had nearly filled with dark clouds now, and as we ascended, the\r\ntemperature steadily fell, and soon there was a distinct chill in the air, causing\r\nme and the boys to button our waistcoats and jackets around us and Father to\r\nhaul his greatcoat from the wagon. Ruth and Annie drew their shawls over their\r\nheads, and up on the wagon, Mary got out blankets, wrapped one around her\r\nand Sarah, passed another to Mr. Epps and a third to Ruth and Annie.\r\nA stiff breeze had come up behind us, and the knowledge that we would soon\r\nbe wet and cold silenced us.",
    " The horses plodded steadily on, slower now but still\r\nwith a powerful rhythm, despite the unbroken uphill climb and the great weight\r\nof the load. Mr. Epps had grown somber. No one spoke as we climbed into the\r\nweather. Even the birds had gone silent.\r\nThe trail wound slowly ahead between great, tall trees, with the rocky stream\r\nstill beside us. We had not passed a dwelling place or cleared patch of land for a\r\nlong while, when suddenly we were over the top, and the trail was passing\r\nthrough a broad intervale between two high distant ridges. We passed alongside\r\na beaver pond spiked with the dark standing trunks of drowned trees, when\r\nfinally, a little ways further, the Old Man gave a signal, and we stopped.\r\nHere we rested the animals for a while and stood in the shelter of the wagon,\r\nour backs to the wind and collars up, hands holding on to the brims of our hats\r\nand head coverings. We must have resembled one of the Lost Tribes, wrapped in\r\nblankets and old-fashioned woolen garments, clustered around our wagon and\r\nlivestock on a wilderness trail in the mountains, unsure of whether to push on or\r\ngo back.\r\nThe Old Man studied the glowering sky and said, “Mister Epps, I believe it will\r\nsoon snow.”\r\n“Probably no more than some rain will fall down in the valleys,” Mr. Epps\r\nsaid. “But you are right, Mister Brown; going to snow up here. Might amount to\r\nnothing, might turn out a real blizzard. Never can tell this time of year. You\r\nwant to wait it out?” he asked Father. “Can hole up in them trees yonder” he\r\nsaid, pointing out a nearby grove of tall pines backed and partially sheltered by\r\na high, rocky outcropping. The dark cliffs were close enough to the trail so that\r\nwe could reach their protection easily with the wagon and make a safe overnight\r\ncamp there.\r\nSeveral large, wet flakes of snow brushed past my face. Father asked Mary\r\nhow she felt.",
    " “I’m fine,” she said. “Don’t do anything strictly on my account.”\r\nBut she did not look well: her face was gray and pinched with discomfort, if not\r\npain, and she was shivering.\r\n“I’m concerned somewhat for the livestock,” Father said to Mr. Epps. “If we’re\r\nout here all night in a snowstorm, we’ll do fine, but we might lose a few of the\r\nsheep. The animals are pureblood and aren’t yet bred for winter exposure, and\r\nthey have been kept inside since November.” He asked if there was a farm\r\nbetween this spot and the valley ahead, where the tiny village of Keene was\r\nlocated.\r\nMr. Epps answered that we would not see a house or barn until we got down\r\noff these heights, but we were closer to the Keene valley now than to\r\nElizabethtown, so we should not go back. He remembered that there was a large\r\nfarm located down in the valley a mile or so this side of the village. We might be\r\nable to put up there if this turned into a real storm.\r\nFather removed his hat, and with his hands against his thighs, he lowered his\r\nhead and prayed silently for a moment, while we stood by and watched. Then he\r\nturned to us and said, “Let us keep on, children. Our heavenly Father will protect\r\nus.”\r\n“Well, yes, but we better cut us a brake while we got good trees for it,” Mr.\r\nEpps said. “A few miles yonder, them big wheels going to need a spoke pole for\r\ngetting this load downhill.” I quickly pulled the axes from the wagon and took\r\nWatson into the trees a ways, and in short order we had cut and trimmed a\r\nspruce pole that was long enough to pass through the rear wheels of the wagon.\r\nBy the time we resumed our journey, the snow was falling heavily. The\r\nmountain ridges on either side had disappeared from view, and as we plodded\r\nahead we could see only a few feet in front of us and to the sides. We were all\r\nnow shrouded in blankets, except for the Old Man in his greatcoat.",
    " The snow\r\nwas wet and stuck to us, turning us white, even Mr. Epps. Father and I stumbled\r\nalong in front, searching out the trail a few feet at a time, waving Mr. Epps and\r\nthe team on as we found it. Hours passed like this, until finally the ground under\r\nour feet began to tip and fall away, and we realized that we had reached the\r\nbeginning of the descent to the valley.\r\nMary and Sarah got down from the wagon to walk behind it, and Mr. Epps\r\ndrove the animals now by walking beside them at their heads, talking to them in\r\na quiet, calm voice. Father instructed Ruth to carry Sarah on her back and told\r\nOliver not to let go of Annie’s hand. Watson and Salmon were to hold the\r\nlivestock back from the wagon a good ways, but keep them moving, he said,\r\ndon’t let them huddle up and stall, especially the sheep. Then he and I attached\r\na length of rope to each end of the brake pole. I walked on one side of the\r\nwagon, and Father walked at the other, ready for me to shove the pole across to\r\nhim, under the wagon bed and through the spokes, whenever the wagon\r\nthreatened to rush the horses.\r\nIt was a slow, nasty business, coming down that long, rocky trail ten and\r\nfifteen feet at a time all the way to the valley. At first, the slope was a gentle\r\nincline, and Father and I were able to hold the wagon off the horses by tying the\r\ndriver’s brake back and pushing uphill against the box from the front, our feet\r\nskidding and slipping clumsily in the snow. But soon the descent quickened, and\r\nthe wagon started to break loose. I grabbed the spruce pole out of the wagon box\r\nand slung it across to Father, and we each raced to a tree beside the trail and\r\nlashed the rope around it, locking the wheels.",
    " Then we let the lines out slowly\r\nand inched the wagon down the rough trail, skidding it like a sledge, until the\r\nropes had run nearly all the way out, when we each tied the end to the tree and\r\nscrambled down to the wagon and chocked the wheels with rocks. Then we\r\nstumbled back uphill to the trees, untied the slack ropes, and walked them\r\nforward a ways, where we wound them around a nearer pair of trees. We drew\r\nthem taut again, reached down with our free hand and removed the chocks, and\r\nlet the wagon slide another few feet. Over and over, endlessly, it seemed, we\r\nfollowed in the blinding snow the same elaborate, painful procedure, and\r\nsomewhere out there in front Mr. Epps calmed the snow-covered horses and kept\r\nthem moving together on the nearly invisible trail. My face froze, and the rope\r\nburned my hands raw, and the rocks tore at the tender, exposed skin of my\r\npalms and fingers, while slowly, bit by bit, we lowered the wagon through the\r\nstorm to the valley floor—where, as we descended, the clouds seemed to rise,\r\nand the snow gradually turned to sleet, then to cold rain.\r\nBy the time we got to level ground, it was almost dark, but we could see again.\r\nThere were maple trees with fresh buds glistening on wet limbs, a meandering\r\nriver, cleared, flat meadows covered with new grass, and steep mountains rising\r\nswiftly from the plain and disappearing in low, dark gray clouds.\r\nIn spite of our ordeal, we appeared to be in good shape. The team of Morgans\r\nthat Mr. Epps had advised the Old Man to buy looked positively heroic to me\r\nnow. Mr. Epps seemed as shrewd to me as he did to himself. I grinned at him,\r\nand to my surprise he smiled modestly, almost shyly, back.\r\nMy hands and Father’s were raw and blistered, and our clothes were soaked\r\nthrough.",
    " Poor Mary and Ruth and the children came trudging along behind us,\r\nlooking miserable, wet, and cold, but immensely relieved to be down from the\r\nmountain. And further back came the red Devon cattle and Father’s precious\r\nlong-faced merino sheep and the pigs, with Salmon and Oliver, using the collies,\r\ndutifully keeping them together, hollering and chasing after the stragglers,\r\nbeating them back into line with their sticks. A short ways ahead, I saw a white,\r\ntwo-storey farmhouse with a long porch facing the road and a large, unpainted\r\nbarn and several ramshackle outbuildings behind it, and when I pointed the\r\nplace out to the Old Man, he merely nodded, as if he had known it would be\r\nthere and did not need me to show it to him.\r\nFinally, when we had all come up and were gathered together beside the\r\nwagon, Father removed his hat and prepared again to pray. This time, however,\r\nhe ordered us to do likewise. “Let us give thanks, children,” he said, and we each\r\nuncovered our heads, every one of us, even Mr. Epps.\r\nIn his clear, thin voice, Father said, “Heavenly Father, we humbly thank thee\r\nfor bringing thy children one more time safely through the storm. We thank\r\nthee, O Lord, for protecting us and our worldly goods against the travails and\r\nterrors of the mountain fastness and the fury of the storm. We who are wholly\r\nundeserving of thy boundless care and protection, O Lord, we humbly thank\r\nthee. Amen.”\r\nMr. Epps said his “A-men!” and quickly snapped his hat back on. I followed,\r\nand the others did also, except for Father, who remained bareheaded, face\r\nscrewed up and eyes tightly shut. Uneasily, because of Mr. Epps’s presence,\r\nperhaps, we all walked a few steps away and did not look at the Old Man, and a\r\nmoment later, as if wakened abruptly from sleep, he re-joined us, seeming\r\nsomewhat distracted, if not downright dazed.",
    " This was his usual manner\r\nfollowing prayer, however, and we were all quite used to it and never remarked\r\non it, even amongst ourselves. From our viewpoint, simply, the Old Man prayed\r\nwith greater intensity than the rest of us. From our viewpoint, the Old Man did\r\neverything with greater intensity than the rest of us.\r\nBy the time we reached the roadside farm, the rain had ceased, and the clouds\r\nhad drifted back up the snow-whitened slopes to cover only the mountaintops\r\nabove, revealing a broad, grassy floodplain here below. A mile or so further, Mr.\r\nEpps informed us, was the village of Keene, where eight or ten additional\r\nfamilies resided. “Mostly, they just scratches out a living. Not much different\r\nfrom us folks up there beyond the notch in Timbuctoo” he said, pointing to a\r\nsharp cut in the distant high ridge to the west.\r\nFather said, “That, Mister Epps, will soon change.”\r\n“Yassuh, Mister Brown” he said, and our eyes met for an instant, and I saw\r\nthat he did not believe that the Old Man would be able to change anything,\r\nanywhere.\r\nAs we approached the white house and barn, we noticed that the place, clearly\r\na once-prosperous dairy farm, was showing distinct signs of inattention—broken\r\nfences and tumbled walls, windblown shingles on the ground, a two- or three-\r\nyear-old pile of dung collected behind the barn, and none of the abundant\r\ncleared land tilled yet.\r\nThe place was owned by a man in his mid-twenties, a Mr. Caleb Partridge—\r\nwhose youth, when he opened the door to Father’s knock, surprised me—and his\r\nmiddle-aged wife, Martha. The couple welcomed us in, evidently pleased by the\r\nunexpected prospect of extending food and shelter to such a bedraggled party of\r\ntravelers. Mr. Partridge, a tall, gaunt man with a thick black beard and heavy\r\nteeth, had a brutish handsomeness about him.",
    " His wife was pink-faced and plain\r\nas oats and seemed almost simple in her shyness, for she giggled nervously\r\nwhenever one of the adults spoke, even when I was the speaker, and listened\r\nwith great seriousness to whatever the children, Annie and Sarah, offered by\r\nway of conversation, as if only they did not frighten her.\r\nThe couple, apparently childless, resided there alone with an aged woman,\r\nwhom the man introduced as his wife’s mother. She sat in a corner of the large\r\nkitchen, mumbling and nodding agreeably to herself, while we warmed our faces\r\nand hands and dried our clothing before the huge fireplace and while Mrs.\r\nPartridge fussed over Ruth and Mary and the little girls, bringing cloths to help\r\nthem dry their hair and serving up bowls of hot cider and ample portions of\r\nfreshly baked corn bread.\r\nLater, when the boys and Mr. Epps and I had fed and bedded down the\r\nanimals and returned to the house, we all seated ourselves at the Partridges’ long\r\ntrestle table before a steaming pot of venison stew. Mr. Epps, however, hung\r\nback by the corner of the fireplace, where he stood with his dark face held\r\ndeliberately away from us. Finally, Father noticed him there and said, “Ah,\r\nMister Epps! Come quickly, or your bowl will be snatched by one of these greedy\r\nchildren!”\r\nThe Partridges, all three, even the old lady, looked up at Father with\r\nexpressions of mild surprise on their bland faces. But Mrs. Partridge quickly\r\nfetched another plate and spoon, and Mr. Epps crossed to the table and joined\r\nus, seating himself with serious mien between me and Watson and directly\r\nacross from Father, who then took the liberty, as he put it, of blessing the meal—\r\nwhereupon with great appetite we all did eat.",
    "\r\nWe stabled our animals in the barn that night and—except for Mary, Ruth,\r\nSarah, and Annie, who were given pallets inside the house by the fire—slept in\r\nthe loft above. It had once been a fine, tight structure, but now the roof leaked,\r\nfloorboards were rotting, and the hay was several years old and filled with dust\r\nand debris. Two scrawny milch cows were all the Partridges seemed to own for\r\nlivestock, and they looked like aged, weak milkers ready to quit.\r\nApparently, most of the Partridges’ cattle had died off in recent years or had\r\nbeen butchered for beef or sold. For income during the long winters, Mr.\r\nPartridge had taken to killing large numbers of deer and shipping the venison by\r\nsledge south to Albany. He complained that the place was too large for him and\r\nhis wife to work alone, and there were no men in the area who hired out. The\r\nwoman had inherited the property from her father, a veteran of the Ticonderoga\r\ncampaigns in the Revolution, who had taken a land grant here as payment for\r\nhis military services and thus had been one of the first settlers in the region. Mr.\r\nPartridge, the landless third son of a New Hampshire grower of flax, had himself\r\nbeen a farmer for hire, had wandered here from New England, and had come to\r\nownership of the farm nearly six years ago by marrying his employer’s only child\r\nand heir a few months before his employer’s death.\r\nI learned all this the next morning, following our departure from the farm,\r\nfrom Father, who had stayed up late talking with Mr. Partridge, after the rest of\r\nus had staggered off to the barn to sleep. The Old Man had a way of eliciting\r\npersonal information from strangers when he got them alone.",
    " His questions were\r\ndisarmingly direct, and his inquiry seemed almost scientific in its detachment,\r\nwhich in a sense it was, for he was not so much interested in a man’s personal\r\nlife as he was in learning about his character and about human nature generally.\r\nUsually, when Father interrogated a person new to him, his immediate aim was\r\nto move the inquiry, by way of questions about family and background, to the\r\nquestion of slavery and race, so as to distinguish friend from foe, certainly, but\r\nalso because, according to Father, it was on this question more than any other\r\nthat a white man revealed the true nature of his character.\r\n“Our benefactor and new neighbor, Mister Partridge;’ he said to me as we\r\nwalked along at the head of our little caravan, “is one of those men who says he\r\nfinds slavery and Negroes equally repugnant. But I believe that he would happily\r\naccept both, if it saved his wife’s farm from ruin and left him free to hunt and\r\nfish.” He added, “I doubt he’ll be of much use to us.”\r\nWe had left just at sunrise, under a cloudless deep blue sky with the morning\r\nstar and a half-moon floating high beside us in the south like a diamond and a\r\nsilver bowl. The road was somewhat mudded from yesterday’s rain, but Mr. Epps\r\nexpected it to be dried out by the time we got up into the mountains again,\r\nwhere, he explained, the road crossed mostly stone anyhow. After passing\r\nthrough the tiny settlement of Keene—a post office, general store, log church,\r\ntavern, and a half-dozen log houses huddled together and guarded by mangy,\r\nlong-haired dogs that all seemed to be related—we crossed the East Branch of\r\nthe Au Sable River and made our way easefully uphill past freshly plowed fields,\r\nswitch-backing towards the notch that cut through the range of mountains which\r\nlay between us and North Elba.\r\nI had not liked Mr. Partridge, and I told Father that.",
    "\r\n“No,” he said, “nor did I.1 suspect he beats the woman and secretly mistreats\r\nthe old lady. The man bears watching, though. Somewhere along the line,” he\r\nsaid, “I fear we’ll have to cut him down.”\r\nThis, of course, I could not then imagine, for no one seemed less likely to\r\noppose us and our work with the Negroes of Timbuctoo in any focused way than\r\nthe lazy young man in whose house we had just stayed. But when it came to\r\nknowing ahead of time who would oppose him, the Old Man could be downright\r\nprescient. On a dozen or more occasions, I had seen him accurately predict\r\nwhich man from a congregation or town, to keep us Browns from fulfilling our\r\npledge to rid this nation of slavery, would threaten our very lives, which man\r\nwould simply turn away and let us continue, and which man would join us in\r\nthe work. The Lord’s Work, as Father called it.\r\n“Well,” said I, “at least the fellow was hospitable to travelers.”\r\n“I would not call it that.”\r\n“We’re ten people. Nine of us and Mister Epps, and he fed and housed us all,\r\nand he let us enjoy his fire and shelter our animals. I’d call that hospitable,\r\nFather.” Though I did not like Mr. Partridge, in those days I sometimes found\r\nmyself feeling sorry for individuals that the Old Man harshly condemned.\r\n“You don’t know him as well as I.”\r\n“Tell me, then. Tell me what you know about Mister Partridge that I don’t.\r\nBeyond his marrying a homely woman for her property.”\r\n“Trust me, Owen.”\r\n“Father, I’m trying to!”\r\nWe walked in silence for a while, and then Father said, “You remember when\r\nhe came out to help me hitch the team to the wagon, while the rest of you were\r\ntending the beeves and sheep, and Ruth and Mary and the girls were inside the\r\nhouse?”\r\n“I saw him out there, yes.”\r\n“Well, the man came up to me and asked for payment for our food and\r\nlodging. He presented me with an itemized bill, written out.",
    "” It was an\r\nembarrassment to Father. Not because he had no money to give Mr. Partridge,\r\nhe said, but because he had not expected it. If he had anticipated Mr. Partridge’s\r\ncharges, he would have negotiated an acceptable arrangement beforehand, and\r\nfailing that, we would have camped someplace alongside the river. Mr. Partridge\r\nhad surprised Father, and he found himself painfully embarrassed by it.\r\nWe resumed walking uphill in silence, with the wagon and team of Morgans,\r\nin Mr. Epps’s capable hands, clambering along behind us, Mary and Ruth and the\r\ngirls all together now on foot and cheerfully admiring the spectacular vistas\r\nopening up on either side of the track, and, at the rear, the boys and our small\r\nherd of livestock. The road made its circuitous, slowly ascending way along the\r\nback of a buttressing ridge. The morning sun was shining full upon our backs\r\nnow, and it was as if yesterday’s brief snowstorm had never occurred.\r\n“I must make a confession, Owen,” the Old Man went on. I said nothing, and\r\nhe continued. “It concerns Mister Partridge. The man’s request for payment\r\nconfused me. I told him that I could not pay him with money, because I had\r\nnone. I’m ashamed to say that I gave him instead the clock.”\r\n“The clock? Your grandfather’s clock?”\r\n“Yes.”\r\nI was astonished. Except for his chest of books, Great-Grandfather Brown’s\r\nmantel clock was Father’s most valued household possession. Made of\r\ncherrywood, it was a treasure that had been entrusted to Father’s care years\r\nearlier by his own father; it was perhaps his only family heirloom. It made no\r\nsense to me. How could he have handed it over to Mr. Partridge so easily? And\r\nin exchange for so little—a single night’s lodging.\r\n“I simply retrieved the clock from the wagon, unwrapped it, and passed it over\r\nto him, and he accepted it as payment quite happily and at once carried it into\r\nhis house.",
    " Where I hope Mary and Ruth did not see it.”\r\nI looked back at the women. Ruth held her half-sister Sarah’s hand, and beside\r\nher Mary held Annie’s; the two women were themselves holding hands and\r\nchatting lightly to one another. “No, I’m sure they didn’t see Mister Partridge\r\ncarrying off Great-Grandfather’s clock. They seem very happy,” I added\r\nuselessly.\r\n“They will know it soon enough. Oh, I am a fool!” he pronounced. “A fool!”\r\nI did not know what to say, so, as usual, said nothing. Most times, when I did\r\nnot understand something that Father had done or said, it was because he had\r\nacted or spoken more wisely than I. At such times, for obvious reasons, my best\r\ncourse was to remain silent and await the arrival of understanding. In this case,\r\nhowever, the Old Man had indeed been foolish, and by comparison I was the\r\nwise one.\r\nStill, I remained silent. I loved my father, and respected him, even when he did\r\na foolish or wrong thing.\r\nBy mid-morning, we were well out of the valley, and for a while the track\r\nturned steeply uphill. Mr. Epps, or Lyman, as I had begun calling him, got down\r\nfrom the box and walked beside the struggling horses, coaxing them on, and\r\nFather and I fell back and got behind the wagon and put our shoulders to it. The\r\ndense, impenetrable forests up here had never been cut, even those trees that\r\nclosed like a pale against the road, and the towering pines and spruces had\r\nbegun to block off the sky from our view, covering us with thick, cooling day-\r\nlong shadows.\r\nAlthough we were now far above the greening valley, the air was still\r\nsufficiently warm that most of yesterday’s snowfall had melted early and had run\r\noff the sides into small rivulets and brooks that dropped away from the ridge,\r\ndisappearing into the forest, where we could see dark gray remnants of the\r\nwinter snows, which looked permanent, practically, and glacial.",
    " The only birds\r\nwe saw up here were curious little chickadees and siskins and the occasional\r\nscreaming blue jay—winter birds. None of the hardwood trees or low bushes had\r\nput out their buds yet, and the scattered thatches of grasses we saw lay in\r\nyellowed mats, still dead from last year’s frost.\r\nNothing in the natural world appeared ready for the resurrection of spring.\r\nWorse, it was as if we were steadily slipping backwards in time, with May and\r\nthen April disappearing behind us and darkest winter rising into view just ahead.\r\nSoon we were struggling through yesterday’s unmelted, ankle-deep snow. It was\r\ncold and nearly dark here below the tall trees, as if earlier this morning, before\r\ncrossing overhead, the sun, unbeknownst to us, had reversed its path and had\r\ndescended and set behind us. Except for Father, we had shrouded ourselves with\r\nblankets again. A steady, high wind blew through the upper branches of the\r\ntrees, raising a distant unbroken chorus of grieving voices to accompany our\r\nslow pilgrimage.\r\nAfter a while, almost without my noticing it, the ground leveled off somewhat,\r\nand Father and I no longer had to stay close to the wagon to be ready to push it.\r\nOur little group had strung itself out practically in single file, as if we each of us\r\nwished to be alone with our morbid thoughts, with Father in his greatcoat up at\r\nthe head of the column, and then the team and wagon driven by Lyman, and me\r\ntrudging along in its tracks. Behind me came Mary, Ruth, Sarah, and Annie,\r\npicking their way through the snow in a ragged line, while stretching back for\r\nmany rods walked the livestock, singly or sometimes two animals abreast, with\r\nSalmon and Oliver positioned among them to keep them moving, and back\r\nsomewhere out of sight, Watson and the collie dogs brought up the rear.",
    "\r\nThe road by now had dwindled to a narrow, palisadoed trail barely the width\r\nof our wagon. It no longer switch-backed across the side of the mountain, and\r\nthere were no longer the occasional breaks in the trees with views of the forested\r\nslopes and ridges below. Instead, plunging across slabs of rock and over snarls of\r\nthick roots, the trail ran straight into the still-darkening forest, as if down a\r\ntunnel, and had we met a wagon or coach coming out of the tunnel towards us,\r\nwe could not have turned aside to let it rush past. It seemed that there was\r\nnothing ahead of us but slowly encroaching snow and darkness.\r\nWhen, suddenly, as if struck by a blow, I realized that we had emerged from\r\nthe forest. Light poured down from the skies, and the towering trees seemed to\r\nbow and back away. Dazzled by the abrupt abundance of light and space, I saw\r\nthat we were passing along the shore of a long, narrow lake that lay like a steel\r\nscimitar below high, rocky escarpments and cliffs, beyond which there loomed\r\nstill higher mountains, which curved away and disappeared in the distance. The\r\nenormous scale of open space, snow-covered mountains, precipices, and black,\r\nsheer cliffs diminished our size to that of tiny insects, as we made our slow way\r\nalong the edge of the glistening lake. Wonderstruck, gaping, we traced the hilt of\r\nthe sword-shaped body of water and crossed the long slant of its cutting edge to\r\nthe point, where we exited from the gorge as if through an ancient stone gate.\r\nWe had passed through Cascade Notch, and below us lay the beautiful wide\r\nvalley of North Elba. Off to our left, mighty Tahawus and Mclntyre rose from the\r\nplain, splitting the southeastern cloudbank. To our right, in the northwest, we\r\ncould see Whiteface Mountain, aged and dignified by its wide scars and pale\r\ngray in the fading afternoon sun.",
    " And between the mountains, spreading out at\r\nour feet for miles, lay undulating forests scratched by the dark lines of rivers and\r\nthe rich, dark tablelands, grassy meadows, and marshes that we would call the\r\nPlains of Abraham.\r\nLyman drew the wagon to a halt, and the family came and gathered around it\r\nand admired the wonderful sight together. We removed the damp blankets from\r\nour shoulders, folded them and placed them back into the wagon. Then Father\r\ntook himself off from us a ways and lowered his head and silently prayed, while\r\nthe rest of us continued simply to admire the generosity and beauty of the land.\r\nFor a long time, no one spoke, and then, when Father had rejoined us, Lyman\r\nsaid, “We better keep moving, Browns, if we wants to get home by nightfall.” He\r\nslapped the reins, and the wagon jerked forward along the rocky, narrow road,\r\nand we all moved back into line behind it, walking easily downhill into the\r\nvalley, as the sun descended towards the hills and mountains beyond.\r\nChapter 6\r\nOn our arrival at North Elba, after Lyman Epps had departed for his own home,\r\nwe passed nearly a full week at the long-abandoned farm on the Keene Road,\r\nbefore any of us ventured forth again—time spent unpacking the wagon and\r\ncleaning, re-organizing, and repairing the tumble-down cabin and shed, which\r\nwere too small to be properly called a house and barn. In various ways we were\r\nstretching the structures so as to fit our many belongings and our numerous\r\nselves. Then, on the morning that I came to breakfast ready to commence\r\nplowing the one sizeable, cleared field on the place, Father instructed me not to\r\nplow.\r\nThis surprised me. With the shortness of the growing season, there was a clear\r\nneed to get the ground turned over and the seed sown as quickly as possible. It\r\nwas a clear, dry day, and Watson and Salmon were already waiting for me in the\r\nshed.",
    " I stood at the door to the cabin on my way outside, while Father perched\r\non a three-legged stool next to the stove, finishing his morning shave.\r\n“You don’t want me to plow today,” I said to him, making it a statement, not a\r\nquestion. Repeating his words was one of my ways of getting the Old Man to\r\nexplain his purpose without seeming to question his authority.\r\n“No. Saddle the lead horse, Adelphi, for me. I’ve developed a real fondness for\r\nthe animal. And hitch the off-horse to the wagon and load up my transit and\r\nlines,” he said. “It’s time for you and me to call on our African neighbors. Time\r\nfor us to go to Timbuctoo.”\r\nAlthough I wasn’t particularly glad of the chance to put off the plowing, I was\r\neager to see Timbuctoo, for I had never visited a Negro farming community\r\nbefore. As far as I knew, this was the only one in the Northeast, although Father\r\nsaid there were a few just across the border, in Canada. I remember wishing that\r\nit had a different name, however. I knew from Lyman that, while the acreage\r\nthat Gerrit Smith had given them to farm was located in the valley in various\r\nspots, the Negroes had clustered their cabins together on a narrow, rising section\r\nof the tableland southeast of the village of North Elba. They might have called\r\ntheir settlement the Heights, I thought, or South Elba. But, no, they had named it\r\nTimbuctoo.\r\n“Same as Timbuctoo in Guinea,” Lyman had explained to me. “You know, like\r\nthe way white folks call their towns New London and New York and Manchester\r\nand such, so as to bring back to their minds the place they came from.” They had\r\neven made a flag to fly above the settlement, he told me. “Red, like the blood of\r\nthe slaves, with one star on it. The freedom star.",
    "”\r\nI could see that from their perspective, although they had no more memory of\r\nAfrica than I had of England, Timbuctoo was an affectionate and respectful\r\nname, which I am sure is how Father took it. No doubt their need went beyond\r\nthat, for while I was connected to my English forefathers by means of the\r\nlanguage I spoke, the Negroes’ links to their ancestors had been cut away by\r\nslavery, which gave the word “Timbuctoo” a greater resonance in their ears than\r\ndid words like “Manchester” and “New London” in mine. But I could also hear\r\nthe whites in the region saying the Negroes’ name for their settlement in a\r\nderisive and derogatory way.\r\n“Wouldn’t it be better, this first time, for us just to walk over there?” I asked\r\nthe Old Man. “In a neighborly way, as equals among equals?” I didn’t want to\r\nmake our first appearance there with Father up on horseback and me driving a\r\nwagon. The picture put me out somewhat, made me feel slightly uncomfortable,\r\nfor it placed us on a height in our first meetings with these people, who,\r\naccording to Lyman, owned no horses or oxen, had but a few swine and dunghill\r\nfowl, and drew their plows themselves or chopped their soil by hand with hoes\r\nand spades. Our elevated position might suggest that we regarded ourselves as\r\nMr. Gerrit Smith’s newly hired overseers riding out to examine the number and\r\ncondition of the plantation darkies.\r\nFather wiped his razor clean and stood and buttoned his waistcoat. Mary, who\r\nwas again feeling poorly, lay abed where she and Father had slept on the\r\nmattress placed next to the stove. The rest of us had slept in the attic above.\r\nWith just two rooms downstairs, the cabin, though cozy and clean, was crowded\r\nas a small boat. “No” Father said. “I can understand your discomfort, but it’s\r\nnecessary for us to make a proper show for them. They are a downtrodden\r\npeople, Owen.",
    " And we need them to see that Mister Smith has taken them\r\nseriously enough to send out a significant sort of man to deal with them.” When\r\nyou offer your services to men who consider themselves mighty, he explained,\r\nit’s good to go modestly and small. An honest man approaches Herod’s tent with\r\ndust on his sandals. But when you come to help people who for generations have\r\nbeen made to regard themselves as lowly and undeserving, you come as grandly\r\nas you can and with fanfare. The first gift we offer them, he said, will be a sense\r\nof their great value as human beings. They are not simply the despised ex-\r\nproperty of men, they are the blessed children of God, and until they possess\r\nthat high a view of themselves, they will not be able to utilize our further gifts.\r\n“So wear your coat and hat, son,” he said, with a hint of a smile on his thin lips.\r\n“And button your shirt to your throat. Today you must look like the son of an\r\nimportant man. A surveyor. You can wear your plowman’s smock tomorrow.”\r\nFather rode ahead of me, seated like a preacher, erect and reflective-seeming, as\r\nif he were not admiring or even conscious of the splendid scenery that\r\nsurrounded us. He was fully as aware of the landscape as I, however. More so,\r\nprobably. He no longer surprised me when, after a journey during which I had\r\nbelieved him throughout to have been lost in thought, he gave to Mary or the\r\nothers who had remained at home a vividly detailed report of everything that we\r\nhad passed, even including the flowers in the glades, the birds in the trees, and\r\nthe trees and shrubs, all of which he had carefully noted to himself and had\r\nnamed in passing and had remembered.\r\n“When we have named a thing, we have begun to see it,” he often said. “And\r\nin so doing we praise and give continual thanks to our heavenly Father.",
    " Thus it\r\nis to God’s greater glory that we name the most obscure flower in His field.” He\r\nhad made a game of it when we were children, testing our abilities to identify by\r\nname, not the hawkweed or purple vetch or red milium, which everyone knew\r\nand admired, but the tiny heal-all, the spotted knapweed, and the lowly\r\nsquawroot. Salmon was the best of us. Even as a small boy of seven or eight, he\r\nknew the names and uses of hundreds of flowers and plants that the rest of us,\r\nincluding Father, barely noticed. He knew that the burnet weed will stanch a\r\nwound, that coltsfoot will cure a cough, and that a sick deer will eat\r\npickerelweed, and he knew where in forest and field to find them all.\r\nFather’s and my arrival at the settlement was not quite the grand occasion that\r\nI had expected. But it was more the fault of my high expectations than the\r\nsomewhat dismal reality I encountered, and my expectations, I felt, were more\r\nthe fault of Lyman than of Father. Earlier, as our journey into the mountains\r\nfrom Westport had progressed, Lyman had spoken to me with increasing\r\nfriendliness and sincerity. Then, lying side by side in the stale hay of the\r\nPartridge barn, he and I had talked long after the others had fallen to sleep. That\r\nwas when he told me to call him Lyman, since we were close in age, and I\r\nagreed, but with reluctance, for somehow my calling him by his given name\r\nseemed, in my eyes, at least, to demean him.\r\n“You’ll have to call me Owen, then,” I told him, and after he had done it\r\nseveral times, it no longer seemed so strange for me not to be addressing him in\r\nFather’s way, as Mr. Epps.\r\nHe was eager to hear about the famous Negro abolitionist and orator Frederick\r\nDouglass, the escaped slave who had visited Father several times in Springfield\r\nthe previous year. Lyman was mightily impressed that Father was sufficiently\r\nconnected to Mr.",
    " Douglass that the great man had actually visited our home and\r\nhad even stayed overnight with us. I may have been a little over-impressed with\r\nit myself and thus doubtless exaggerated somewhat the firmness of the\r\nconnection, for Father and Mr. Douglass had not yet formed the close association\r\nthat would mark their later relations. And that in turn might account for\r\nLyman’s exaggerated report of the Negro settlement in North Elba, in terms both\r\nof their number and of their achievements as settlers. He may have been trying\r\nto impress the son of a close friend of the famous Frederick Douglass.\r\nThere were, he said, close to a hundred Negroes living in North Elba, most of\r\nthem freedmen, with a small number of fugitives secreted among them,\r\nindividuals who could not be named. “Could be, Owen, that I myself am running\r\nfrom a slavemaster” he said, “and the next man be the freedman. You can’t know\r\nwhich is which, can’t tell one from the other, freedman or slave, unless I name\r\nhim for you—and even then, how you going to be sure? So long as you know\r\nthat one of us is free, then the next man is safe. Leastways up there in the\r\nmountains he’s safe, because the slave-catchers, they don’t dare show their faces\r\nin Timbuctoo.”\r\nThe Negroes were armed, he said, and would kill any man who came sneaking\r\naround looking to haul a single one of them, man, woman, or child, back to\r\nslavery. I lay there in the darkness next to him, rapt with pleasure, as he\r\ndescribed a remnant people settled in the wilderness and living off the land, an\r\nindustrious people, secure and vigilant, setting lookouts on the peaks, with\r\nelaborate signaling systems, rams’ horns and drums, to give the warning\r\nwhenever a stranger entered their wild domain. I pictured valiant Negroes\r\nambushing their enemies at the mountain passes.",
    "\r\nFor years, Father had told us stories about the Maroons of Jamaica, whom he\r\nso admired—those escaped slaves who had fled into the mountainous interior of\r\ntheir island and who for half a century fought off the mighty British army, until\r\nfinally the King of England gave up the fight and let them stay in their highland\r\nvillages, where they raised their families and ruled their territory unimpeded. I\r\nsaw the Negroes of Timbuctoo as a modern American version of those old\r\nJamaicans, and of the rebellious slaves who had followed Toussaint L’Ouverture\r\ninto the mountain fastness of Hispaniola, waiting for the moment when they\r\nwould have the numbers and the occasion to sweep down upon the sugarcane\r\nplantations along the coastal plain and strike a death blow against their French\r\nowners, freeing themselves from servitude forever. I imagined the Negroes of\r\nTimbuctoo to be warriors of that high order.\r\nLyman told me that they had built their cabins close together all in one place\r\nto make them easy to defend, and when they worked their fields, which were\r\noften located far from their cabins, they went armed with swords and guns. Even\r\nthe women and children, he said. I asked who was their general or leader. Was\r\nthere one among them who functioned as a chieftain, and how had they elected\r\nhim? I remember peering through a broken window in Mr. Partridge’s loft to the\r\nshrubby field behind the barn, where fireflies lit up the spring night like the\r\nsilent firing of the guns of a hundred scattered, hidden warriors—here, here,\r\nhere; gone, gone, gone—harassing their huge, clumsy enemy, maddening him\r\nwith the accumulated pain of many small blows struck by an army of black-\r\nskinned warriors made invisible by the darkness.\r\n“No one chief rules us,” Lyman said. “What we do, Owen, is reason together.",
    "\r\nWe sit and talk things out, mostly amongst the men who knows a thing or two.\r\nMen such as myself. And then we comes to an agreement together about how we\r\ngoing to do this and that. Course, there’s some folks who gets listened to more\r\nclosely than the others, there’s some who don’t get no never mind at all, and\r\nthere’s some who’re in between. Me, I’m one of the in-between fellows. On\r\naccount of my still being a young man and all. But with me working for Mister\r\nBrown now, that could change some. Folks up there thinks highly of Mister\r\nBrown,” he said, wistfully, as if he had forgotten that I was the son of Mr.\r\nBrown, almost as if he had forgotten for a moment that I was white, which\r\npleased me. More than that, it comforted me.\r\nIt never happened that when in the presence of a Negro I did not feel\r\nperceived as white and then at once begin to think of myself in those terms also.\r\nNo matter how used to the presence of Negroes I became—and since my early\r\nchildhood, Father, whenever possible, had brought all types of Negroes into our\r\nhousehold, providing us with daily, respectful proximity to them—a black\r\nperson made me constantly conscious of my whiteness. I could not forget it. It\r\nangered me in a way that left me secretly ashamed. And on those occasions, in a\r\nchildish way, I sometimes actually wished that Negroes did not exist as if their\r\nvery presence in our country were pestilential and the disease of race-\r\nconsciousness were their fault and not ours.\r\nI didn’t know how to inoculate myself against this disease, except to associate\r\nstrictly with whites, which I could never do and call myself a man. Because of\r\nour history together, I didn’t know how to see around or through a black\r\nperson’s race, and thus I could not see around or through my own. And\r\nwhenever I became aware of my whiteness, I was ashamed.",
    " Not just because of\r\nthe horrors of slavery, although that surely provided plenty of reason for any\r\nwhite American to feel ashamed of his race, but because, in the eyes of the God\r\nof my father and, most importantly, in the eyes of my father himself, race-\r\nconsciousness was wrong. Just as wrong as not being able to forget, whenever I\r\nfound myself in the presence of a woman, that I was a man and not just a fellow\r\nhuman being. It was as if race-consciousness, like sex-consciousness, were some\r\nkind of uncontrollable lust that left a white man with no regard for the deep,\r\npersonal relations of friendship and family.\r\nPride, lust, envy—these are the certain consequences of race-consciousness,\r\nwhether you are black or white, just as they are the consequences of thinking\r\nconstantly of your maleness or femaleness when in the presence of the other sex.\r\nIt affects you in such a way that you either feel proud of your race or sex, mere\r\naccidents of birth, or envy the other’s; proud, you think of the other person as\r\navailable for your base and sensual use, or else, ashamed, you wish to have the\r\nother person make use of you. You do not view yourself or the other person\r\nsimply as a person. Perhaps only the old New England Puritans or certain of their\r\nlatter-day descendants, like Father, were properly equipped, morally and\r\nintellectually, to recognize and defeat such serpentine failings. I, however,\r\ndespite Father’s best intentions and teaching, was not so equipped, and as a\r\nresult, I frequently added a fourth sin to the list-wrath. For on those occasions\r\nwhen I had become enraged by my inability to overcome my weakness, I\r\ndirected my anger, not at myself, as I should have, but against the person whose\r\nrace had made me conscious of my own race or the person whose sex had\r\nenflamed me.",
    " The latter I might defeat by living like an anchorite and\r\nwithholding myself from the company of women other than those related to me\r\nby blood, which, of course, is precisely what I have done. The former, however, I\r\ncould defeat only by abandoning my pledge to dedicate my life to the\r\ndestruction of slavery and arranging my life so as to associate only with white\r\npeople. But waging war against slavery was my sworn duty, as marriage was not,\r\nand by the time I had reached my young manhood, thanks to the imprint made\r\nupon my mind and spirit by Father, abdication of it was no longer imagineable.\r\nIt was for such complicated and barely understood reasons as these, then, that\r\nI found myself strangely and powerfully soothed by Lyman’s presence that night\r\nin the barn in Keene. It was the idea of an oppressed people’s flight to sanctuary\r\nin the impenetrable mountains that seduced me—that and the brief relief from\r\nthe burden of race-consciousness that came over me as I lay in the dark beside\r\nLyman Epps, a black man my own age who spoke to me as if I were not white, as\r\nif, in fact, I were black or he were white—as if we two were of the same race.\r\nI lay there in the hay, astonished and full of wonder and delight. My usual\r\nhigh agitation, which I had come to think of as a permanent aspect of my mind,\r\nhad ceased altogether. And for a few precious moments that night, I did not feel\r\nlike a stranger to myself. A peculiar restfulness had come over me like a warm\r\nbreeze—and I thought that all the years of my life so far, since the death of my\r\nmother long before, I had been traveling far from home, a child moving through\r\nthe world disguised as an adult; and now, unexpectedly, on this May night in a\r\nbarn in the Adirondack mountains, I had been allowed to remove my disguise\r\nand settle into my childhood bed, a boy again.",
    " I reached out in the dark and\r\ntook Lyman’s hand in mine, and held it for a long time, with neither of us\r\nmoving or saying anything, until, still holding his hand, I fell peacefully asleep.\r\nThe next day, on returning to my usual agitated state, I realized with horror\r\nthat, for all its innocence, my simple, affectionate gesture might well have been\r\nregarded by Lyman as brazen or even wanton, and therefore despicable. To my\r\nimmense relief, Lyman showed no sign of having misunderstood me, and we\r\ncontinued to engage one another for the rest of our journey to North Elba with\r\nthe same easy familiarity of the evening before. When our little caravan finally\r\narrived at our new home, Father paid him for his services with the sack of seed\r\nand supplies that he had promised, and Lyman waved a simple goodbye and\r\nwalked on down the road. And I did not see him again until Father and I rode\r\ninto the place called Timbuctoo.\r\nA few miles south of the village of North Elba, we passed off the old Military\r\nRoad onto a rutted, rocky lane and into the woods, with Father in the lead on\r\nAdelphi and me in the wagon behind him, driving the horse we had named\r\nPoke. From the condition of the trail, it was clear that not many wagons had\r\npassed this way before, and several times Father had to dismount and clear away\r\nfallen branches before I could proceed. Then suddenly we entered a cleared\r\nspace marred by the charred stumps of trees, and before us were some eight or\r\nten cabins, which were more like shanties than proper log cabins, little huts\r\nmade of sticks and old cast-off boards and patches of canvas.\r\nIt was a camp, not a village, with no sign of the palisade and neat log houses\r\nset around a protected square as I had imagined.",
    " There was indeed a flagpole set\r\nin the middle of the clearing, just as Lyman had said, but the pole, stuck into a\r\npile of rocks, was tilted at a pathetic angle, and dangling from the top was a\r\ntattered banner made from an old piece of red wool, a shirt or piece of a blanket,\r\nupon which I could make out a roughly cut five-pointed yellow star.\r\nExcept for a few undersized pigs rooting about in heaps of garbage and a half-\r\ndozen scrawny fowl picking at the wet, smelly ground that lay behind the\r\nprivies, the place looked abandoned. Then I saw several small children with\r\nsomber brown and black faces peering out from the doorways, and I noticed that\r\nhere and there an adult’s dark hand had drawn back a rag from a window so\r\nthat the owner of the hand could observe our approach unseen from the gloom\r\nof the cabin.\r\nAfter a moment, a bearded Negro man of middle-age appeared at the door of\r\none of the shacks and for a second regarded us with caution, when, apparently\r\nrecognizing Father from his earlier visit, he smiled broadly and said, “Mis-ter\r\nBrown!” and stepped forward to greet us. Then several others, men and women\r\nwith children trailing behind, emerged from their homes—which I must call\r\nhovels, for I do not know what else to call them, they were so poorly constructed\r\nand maintained. I could not imagine enduring the bitterly cold winter winds and\r\nsnow with no more protection than those sad bits of shelter provided. I myself\r\nwould have fled long since, I thought. Or else I would have built me a proper log\r\ncabin and fireplace. The lassitude and disarray of these people amazed and\r\nbewildered me. They seemed exhausted and demoralized.\r\nStepping from one of the huts came a man who, after a few seconds of\r\nthinking he was a stranger, I realized was my friend Lyman Epps.",
    " He looked\r\noddly unlike himself here, smaller, thinner, flat-faced, as if all the force had gone\r\nout of him. Even his skin, which previously had been the color of anthracite, had\r\nlost its depth and glow and had turned flint gray. Father had commenced to\r\nspeak with several of the men, in particular to the middle-aged fellow with the\r\nbeard who had come forward before the others and appeared to be their\r\nspokesman. Ignoring me, or so it seemed, Lyman edged past the wagon and\r\nattempted to position himself at the front of the group of men speaking with\r\nFather—a nervous little colored man he was, uneasy and, as I had first regarded\r\nhim down in Westport, not to be trusted.\r\nHe, of course, had not changed in the few days since I had last seen him.\r\nSitting up on my wagon, the son of the great John Brown, a prosperous white\r\nman come with his father to assist and uplift these poor, benighted souls, I was\r\nthe one who had changed. The other men did not defer to or even acknowledge\r\nLyman’s attempts to gain Father’s attention; they shouldered him aside and\r\nblocked him out entirely, as Father spoke to the group of his intention to survey\r\nand stake their property lines and register them with the county clerk’s office\r\nover in Elizabethtown.\r\nThis would entail certain changes in how they did business, he explained,\r\nbecause it meant that they would now be liable for taxes on their land. “But you\r\nwill own your land, my friends. No man, white or black, can encroach upon it,\r\nand you will therefore be free to use it as you please, even to sell it, if you wish,\r\nor to pass it on to your children.” But in order to pay taxes, he went on, they\r\nwould have to raise more than just enough to survive on; they would have to\r\nraise a cash crop or produce a product which they could then sell in the nearby\r\ntowns for cash money.",
    "\r\nI didn’t believe Father was telling these people anything they didn’t already\r\nknow. They weren’t European peasants or field hands straight off an Alabama\r\ncotton plantation. That was the problem, perhaps. Except for the fugitive slaves\r\namongst them, who could not make themselves known and, of course, could not\r\nown land in the United States anyhow and probably would soon disappear into\r\nCanada, where they could freely settle, the residents of Timbuctoo were men and\r\nwomen with city skills—blacksmiths like Lyman, waiters, barbers,\r\nharnessmakers—people who had made pennies at a trade and had saved them\r\nand bought their freedom or, thanks to the kindness of their owners or because\r\nthey were of no particular use as chattel, had been granted it.\r\nAt last, Lyman noticed my presence. Due to my innate shyness, but also\r\nbecause of the complexity and turbulence of my feelings, I hadn’t put myself\r\nforward and instead had waited for him to make the first gesture. Which he did,\r\nbut only after finding himself unable to gain Father’s attention. He held the ears\r\nof the horse Poke and touched the animal’s forehead with his own, then looked\r\nup at me and smiled and asked, “How’s the Morgan horses holding up, Mister\r\nBrown?”\r\n“Owen” I said, more a rebuke than a correction.\r\n“They seems rested up,” he said. “Fine pair of animals, ain’t they? Got some\r\nage on ‘em, but they gonna give you plenty of service. They be plowing your\r\nfields long after you gone from here,” he said, repeating what he had said to\r\nFather back in Westport—an empty remark now, where before it had been a\r\nfresh recommendation and a promise. A slender young woman, round-faced and\r\nwith slitted eyes, wearing a tattered yellow shift, a knitted shawl over her\r\nshoulders, had approached us and now stood behind Lyman, watching him.",
    " I\r\nraised my hat to acknowledge her, which caused her to look down at her bare\r\nfeet. She was a pretty, tea-brown woman, with glistening, wiry hair cut short\r\nand worn like a tight black skullcap, and she stood with her hands at her sides,\r\nas if waiting for instructions.\r\nLyman put one hand on her shoulder and drew her forward. “Come meet\r\nyoung Mister Brown. This here’s my wife, Susan,” he announced to me.\r\n“How ... how do,” I stammered, for I was surprised by this information, that\r\nLyman had a wife; in all our conversations, he hadn’t mentioned her, not even in\r\npassing. I hadn’t inquired into his marital state, but nevertheless it’s difficult to\r\nspend several days and nights with a person, as he had with me, and not\r\nmention a wife, if you have one, and consequently I had simply assumed that his\r\nsilence on the subject, like mine, meant that he was unmarried. Now I found\r\nmyself angry at him, as if he had deliberately deceived me.\r\n“You never mentioned you were married,” I said to him.\r\nFather, having heard me speak, turned and saw Lyman. “Ah, Mister Epps,\r\nthere you are!” he said, and at once Lyman left me and, with his hand still on his\r\nwife’s shoulder, moved towards the Old Man, who swung down from his horse\r\nand shook hands with him and made a pleasant fuss over the woman—as I\r\nshould have done.\r\nI did follow the Old Man’s example of getting down from the wagon, though,\r\nand joined him as he spoke with Lyman and his wife. Father was gracious with\r\nher, as he always was with women; regardless of their race or station, he\r\npointedly treated them as equal to himself. I myself was too shy to speak with\r\nany woman directly—except, of course, for my sisters and my stepmother, Mary.\r\nIt was Mary whom Father was speaking of when I drew up to him.",
    " He was\r\nexplaining that she was ill and needed more help with the household chores than\r\ncould be provided by Ruth and the younger children.\r\n“Since the birth of our infant who died this April past, my wife has been\r\npoorly!’ he said. “But not so poorly that she could not stand and work, until\r\nnow. I believe, however, that if she is allowed to keep to her bed for a spell, she\r\nwill recover.”\r\nThis was news to me, but Mary naturally did not confide in me, and I confess\r\nthat I did not make a habit of observing her condition. I bore great good will\r\ntowards the woman but could not help feeling somewhat distant from her,\r\nthrough no fault of her own, certainly. Unlike Ruth, Fred, Jason, and John, I had\r\nremained unable to shift my affections for our true mother over to my father’s\r\nwife.\r\n“Would you be willing to work for me in the fields?” Father asked Lyman.\r\n“Susan I would also like to hire, to keep house and care for the smaller children.\r\nYou could both put up at our place until the fall, eat at our table, and take a\r\nquarter-share in the harvest, so that you could then get your own farm off to a\r\nproper start next year.”\r\nI touched Father’s sleeve with my hand. “We have barely enough room for\r\nourselves, Father;’ I said in a low voice. “The boys and I can handle the planting\r\nand haying and the livestock ourselves. Ruth is capable of the rest, with the little\r\nones to help her.”\r\nFather gave me a hard look. “Owen,” was all he said. He resumed talking to\r\nLyman and Susan, and I stalked off. I knew that Lyman and his wife would agree\r\nat once to come over and live with us. However crowded it was at our place,\r\nthere would be more room for the couple there than in their shack here in\r\nTimbuctoo, and a quarter-share of our crop would probably be twice what the\r\nman could raise alone on his own land.",
    " At our table they would eat a full meal\r\nevery day, which they surely never did at their own. Also, Lyman’s standing in\r\nthe Negro community, which seemed to me on the low side, would rise\r\nconsiderably from his and his wife’s association with our family.\r\nBut I also knew what the Old Man was up to: if he was going to be of any use\r\nto these people, he needed to bring at least one of them into close affiliation\r\nwith our family, a trusted and trusting person who would help him penetrate the\r\ncommunity, to speak for him to the others and to inform him as to their thoughts\r\nand needs. It was how he always worked. Beyond surveying their land grants,\r\nbeyond teaching the Negroes how to farm in this climate and on this stingy soil,\r\nFather wanted to set up an Underground Railroad station in North Elba, where\r\nthere was none, at least no station with any known connections to the lines that\r\nran to Canada along the New York side of the Champlain Valley. He intended to\r\ncarry escaped slaves out of the South by way of the Adirondack mountain passes,\r\na route that until now had been used only in isolated cases, when some poor soul\r\nsomehow got off the main route by accident and slipped through the iron-mining\r\ncamps on the south side of Tahawus and followed rumor north through Indian\r\nPass to Timbuctoo and then, traveling alone and at great risk, worked his lonely\r\nway north and east to connect finally with the Lake Champlain line by means of\r\nthe Quaker stationmasters in Port Kent and Plattsburgh.\r\nIn Father’s mind, the passes and ridges of the Adirondacks were the\r\nnorthernmost extension of the entire Appalachian Range, which ran all the way\r\nback through New York State to the Pennsylvania Alleghenies down into\r\nVirginia and on into the very center of the slaveholding region.",
    " His map of the\r\nRailroad was unlike anyone else’s—unlike Harriet Tubman’s, unlike Frederick\r\nDouglass’s, unlike the Quakers’. On Father’s map, the southernmost lines fed like\r\ntaproots from the cotton plantations of Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia up\r\ninto the mountains of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, where the main\r\ntrunk line flowed north and east. It did not split one way towards Niagara and\r\nthe other towards the Hudson Valley and Lake Champlain, as the other maps had\r\nit, but ran in a single line between the two into the rocky heart of the\r\nAdirondacks, straight to North Elba, where a long night’s ride could get you over\r\nthe border into Canada.\r\nFather spoke often and elaborately of this map, and to implement it, he needed\r\nLyman Epps and his wife, Susan—because the Old Man worked his Railroad\r\nalone. He had always done it that way. Whether in Ohio or Pennsylvania or\r\nSpringfield, Massachusetts, John Brown ran his own Underground Railroad line,\r\nand that obliged him to forge his own connections to the Negroes. Except for the\r\nmembers of his immediate family, Father did not trust white people, not even\r\nthe lifelong radical abolitionists like himself, as much as he trusted black people.\r\n“In this work, it’s their lives that are at stake,” he often said. “Not ours. When it\r\ncomes to a showdown, white people can always go home and pretend to read\r\ntheir Bibles, if they want. A black man will have to fire his gun. Who would you\r\nrather have at your side, a well-meaning white fellow who can cut and run if he\r\nwants, or a Negro man whose freedom is on the line?”\r\nLater in the day, after Father had assured the community that they were the\r\nlegal landholders in Timbuctoo and that he would return and commence his\r\nsurvey on the following day, we took our leave of the gloomy place.",
    " In order to\r\nprepare his next day’s work, he carried with him all such bills of sale and\r\ncontracts and deeds as the landholders had in their possession—so greatly did\r\nthe Negroes trust the Old Man that they willingly delivered up to him their only\r\nevidence of their rights to their land. Not that Father would ever betray them;\r\nthey were right to trust him. But the effect Father had on Negroes was difficult\r\nto understand. Mostly I attributed it to the rage against slavery that he never\r\nceased to express; although sometimes, when I was down on Father myself, I\r\nattributed it to the gullibility of the Negroes. The fact is, more than any other\r\nwhite man, Father consistently managed to make Negro people believe that their\r\nstruggle against the evils of slavery and the daily pain and suffering imposed on\r\nthem by racial prejudice were his as well, despite the fact that he was so often a\r\nwhite man in a preacher’s suit sitting up on a very tall horse.\r\nLyman and Susan, with a single sack of belongings and some shabby bedding\r\nand a corn mattress tied in a roll, accompanied us as passengers in the wagon.\r\nThey sat in the box behind me, and I drove, silent and somber, and as before, the\r\nOld Man rode ahead on Adelphi. Every now and then he called back to Lyman\r\nand asked the name of a mountain or inquired as to the ownership of a\r\nparticular stretch of roadside land, and Lyman always had a ready answer—\r\nwhether it was the correct answer, I could not then say, but I did suspect that he\r\nwas making them up to please and impress the Old Man. Later, to my ongoing\r\nchagrin, I learned, of course, that he had been accurate in every case. He knew\r\nthe names of all the peaks in our sight, and he knew whose land was whose and\r\nthe history and use of every landmark. I was behaving like a spurned lover, I\r\nknew, but could not help myself.",
    "\r\nWhen we arrived back at the farm, Father presented Lyman and his wife to\r\nMary, who still lay abed next to the stove, looking very ill, I finally realized. Her\r\nappearance frightened me—her skin was slack and chalky, her small, plain face\r\nwas almost expressionless, and she moved and spoke slowly and with precision,\r\nas if she were in pain. Expressing pleasure to have Susan as a helpmate to Ruth,\r\nshe welcomed the couple to the house. “There is not much room here, as you\r\nsee, but the place is bright and airy,” she said to them in a weak voice.\r\n“We will have to get along like Shakers,” Father declared. “Which means that\r\nMister Epps will make his bed on the male side of the attic, and Missus Epps will\r\nsleep opposite with Ruth and the girls. I trust that won’t prove a difficult\r\narrangement,” he said to Lyman, who glanced overhead towards the attic and\r\nsmiled and said that it would be just fine. I do not know what his wife thought.\r\nThey had given over their privacy, perhaps, but in exchange had received\r\nsuperior shelter. It was, as Father’s joke implied, more than a little like the\r\nexchange many people made in those days, when they gave up their houses and\r\nneighbors and moved in with the Shakers, whose roofs, like ours, did not leak\r\nand whose tables provided plenty of simple fare.\r\nI touched Ruth’s arm and drew her with a signal to follow me outside. We\r\npassed around the corner of the house and made our way up the brushy slope in\r\nback, where we both sat on a broad, rough rock embedded in the hillside and\r\nlooked out over the shake roof of the house to the forested plain and mountains\r\nbeyond. It was mid-afternoon, and the sun was sliding off to our right a ways,\r\ncasting over us and the house and small barn long shadows from the pine trees\r\nthat grew on the hillside behind us.",
    " In the meadow, in dappled sunlight, the\r\nDevon cattle were grazing, and the sheep were scattered up on the scrub-covered\r\nhillside beyond. In front of the house, where the boys were stacking firewood,\r\nFather’s horse and the other horse stood waiting to be watered and set loose to\r\ngraze alongside the cattle.\r\nIt was a lovely scene, actually—a peaceful, orderly domicile and farm set\r\ndown in the midst of splendid scenery, a kind of ideal farmstead. Yet, for all\r\nthat, I saw it as a thrashing and violently upset scene, with its warring elements\r\nheld in place almost against their nature, constrained and barely kept in check\r\nby a trembling willfulness. Father’s, I suppose, but, to a lesser degree, mine also.\r\nRuth seemed to sense the high degree of my agitation, and she stroked the\r\nback of my hand, as if to calm me. “What’s the trouble, Owen?” she asked. “Did\r\nsomething untoward happen today?”\r\n“No, no, nothing. Although the place, Timbuctoo, was a disappointment to\r\nme,” I said and briefly described the sad state of the encampment.\r\nShe tried to comfort me by saying what I knew myself, that it could not be\r\notherwise, for the poor folks who lived there owned few tools and no livestock to\r\nspeak of, and, as Father had told us many times, they knew nothing of how to\r\nfarm in this climate. I had always admired Ruth’s character and in some ways\r\nenvied her, for she seemed to have no difficulty in making herself behave exactly\r\nas she should—the good daughter to Father, the loyal and loving stepdaughter to\r\nMary, and, to me and all the others in our family, the perfect sister.\r\nI, however, since earliest childhood, had struggled constantly with a rebellious\r\nspirit, my mind in a continuous state of disarray and brooding resentment, and\r\nso it seemed that I was forever being placed under the lash of self-chastizement\r\nand correction.",
    " Alone among my brothers and sisters, Ruth understood this\r\nabout me and did not condemn me for it. I could never have confessed to John\r\nor Jason or even to poor Fred what I then confessed to her. “Oh, Ruth,” I\r\nblurted, “I want very much just to leave this place!”\r\n“That’s a terrible wish,” she said in a hushed voice, as if I had blasphemed.\r\n“It shouldn’t be.”\r\n“But Father needs you, and Mother needs you.”\r\n“She’s not our mother.”\r\n“Yes, Owen, she is.”\r\n“Not to me.”\r\n“We have no other mother. And she’s ill and weak, and there’s so much to do\r\nhere before we can call it a proper farm. And Father can’t do what he came here\r\nto do, unless he has your help.”\r\n“I know all that. But I want to leave this place. I want to get away, that’s all.\r\nFrom everything. This farm, the Negroes, these mountains!” I said, waving my\r\nhand at the peaks in the distance, as if they were ugly to me. They weren’t ugly\r\nto me, but I was angry and confused—wrathful was what I was, for, uncertain as\r\nto the object of my anger, I was smearing it over everything in sight. “How can\r\nyou do it, Ruth? Don’t you wish our life were different? Don’t you wish we could\r\nlive normally someplace, like other people, in a town or even on a farm close to\r\nother farms? I want to live like the white people in Springfield, or even down\r\nthere in Westport. This place is awilderness,”I said. “And there’s no one here for\r\nus to be with, except the Negroes. You should see their place, over in\r\nTimbuctoo!” I said, fairly spitting the name. “We’re not like them. And we’re not\r\nlike the dumb, ignorant white farmers around here, either. We’re different than\r\nthat fellow Mister Partridge back in Keene, or the squatters living around here\r\ntrying to steal the land off the Negroes. We’re different. And alone.",
    "”\r\nRuth put her arm around me, and we were both silent, and after a moment, I\r\nmanaged to clear my mind somewhat and said to her, “I’m sorry, Ruth. I\r\nshouldn’t be like this with you.” She patted my hand sweetly, and we were silent\r\nfor a moment more. “Tell me what’s wrong with Mary,”I said. “Is it something\r\nserious? She won’t die, will she?”\r\nRuth did not answer for a long time. Then she said, “No, I don’t think it’s\r\nserious. She has female problems, Owen. That’s all. From her lying-in last fall\r\nwith the birth of Ellen, which hasn’t healed. She will heal, though, and be well\r\nagain, but only if she keeps to her bed and rests. Father knows how she is and\r\nwhat’s wrong. He understands what she needs. By bringing in the colored\r\nwoman, he’s protecting Mother against her own good nature and her need to be\r\nalways at work. And with the woman to help, I’ll be able to do the rest. And\r\nwith Mister Epps helping the boys run the farm, you’ll be free to work alongside\r\nFather and the Negroes. It’s only for a few months, Owen, and then our life will\r\nsettle down again, I’m sure of it.”\r\n“It’ll never settle down again!” I declared. “It’s never been settled! Not since\r\nour mother died have we been at peace in this family!”\r\n“That’s not true, Owen.”\r\n“Don’t you remember how it was before our mother died?”\r\n“No,” she declared, and then abruptly she stood and said, “Come, I must get\r\nback to the house. I’ve got churning—”\r\n“Wait a moment. Just let me tell you how it was then. Because it changed,\r\nRuth, after she died. Believe me, it changed” I said.\r\n“Owen, I know the story. You must settle your mind. You should pray, Owen,\r\nthat’s what. You should pray for forgiveness, and to obtain peace of mind. You’re\r\ntoo much alone, the way you’ve fallen from belief. I can’t talk to you,” she said\r\nfirmly, and moved off from the rock where I sat. “Only the Lord can give you\r\nwhat you need.",
    " I have to get back to the house,” she said, and she turned and\r\nleft me.\r\nI sat in the shade alone awhile then, remembering how it was when I entered the\r\nroom and learned that my mother had died. I remembered the darkness that\r\nswirled like black smoke about my mother’s head as she disappeared into it and\r\nwas gone. I recalled myself staring at the darkness. It had hardened into a flat\r\nblack circle that was located in the exact center of my vision, as if a hole had\r\nbeen burned into the lenses of my eyes, and no matter where I looked, it was\r\nthere, a wafer of darkness, with people and objects disappearing behind it as I\r\nturned my head from side to side. I carried that circle before me for many years,\r\nand when the hole in my lenses finally healed, there remained scars, opaque and\r\nwhitened, which every now and then swam into my field of vision and again\r\nblocked out the world before me.\r\nAs on this late spring afternoon in North Elba, when I stumbled half-blind\r\ndown from the meadow and entered the cabin, where Father and Lyman Epps\r\nand his wife, Susan, stood talking quietly with Mary, who lay abed on a pallet\r\nnear the stove, while Ruth sat on a stool nearby, calmly churning butter.\r\nI could not see Father at all, although I stared directly at his location and\r\nspoke directly to the spot where he stood. Father was in a circle of light,\r\nactually, situated somewhere behind it, as if occluded by a sun floating in the\r\nspace between me and him, so that he was eclipsed by it. On the peripheries I\r\nsaw Lyman, looking alarmed, and his wife, Susan, frightened also, by my wild\r\nvisage, no doubt, and the words that splashed from my mouth.\r\n“Father, I have to tell you something!",
    "” I began, and then I glimpsed Ruth\r\nlooking up at me, dismayed, and Mary seeming bewildered and pained by the\r\nforce of my entry, by the loud interruption of my ill-coordinated and off-balance\r\nbody lurching through the portal as I broke into the placidity of the room, my\r\nvoice loud and cracking as I spoke the words. “Father, you must let me leave!\r\nFather, I’m sorry... “ I began, and then I stopped myself. Struggling to make my\r\ndesire to flee these mountains known to him in a coherent way, wanting merely\r\nhis simple permission to go and live as I wished, I felt more like a child\r\noverwhelmed by a tantrum than a twenty-five-year-old man expressing his regret\r\nthat he must disappoint his father in order to satisfy himself.\r\n“You want to leave us?” Father said, pronouncing the words slowly, as if he\r\nbarely understood them. “You want to fall away from your family and abandon\r\nthe work we have come here to do? Just as you have fallen away from the Lord\r\nand His work?” He paused and drew his breath in through his teeth. “I love thee,\r\nOwen, and for just this reason I have prayed for thee ever since I first saw that\r\nyou had moved so far from the Lord and His word and will. I knew that it would\r\nlead here, and that there would come a time when your duty would seem\r\nmeaningless to you. So where do you wish to go, Owen?” His face, reddened and\r\ntight with anger, belied his calm words. His gray eyes had gone cold on me, and\r\nI felt an actual chill in my bones, as if a damp breeze had suddenly blown\r\nthrough the room.\r\n“Am I not a man, Father? Am I not free to go where I wish and live as I wish?”\r\n“I wouldn’t have you beside me or in my house, if you did not yourself choose\r\nto be there. Where do you wish to go, Owen?”\r\n“Well, I want only to leave here. I... I’m not sure where I want to go to. Back\r\nto Springfield, I guess. To join John there, maybe.",
    " To help him, or find work on\r\nmy own. I don’t know.”\r\n“So it’s not that you’ve learned of someplace else, then, where you can do your\r\nduty to God and your fellow man more effectively than you can here. It’s merely\r\nthat you’re loath to do it here. I say that you are behaving in a cowardly manner,\r\nOwen. Think like a slave, and you are one. A free man doesn’t flee his duty,\r\nunless he’s able to do it better someplace else. You disappoint me greatly,\r\nOwen,” he pronounced. “Springfield! What can you do in Springfield with regard\r\nto your duty, whether it’s your duty to your family or to your fellow man, that\r\nyou can’t better do here? We have all pledged, every one of us, to bend our lives\r\nto overcoming the scourge of slavery. Some of us do it in order to do God’s work,\r\nand some others simply because they are human beings who are themselves\r\ndiminished by the existence of slavery. But for all of us, it is our duty! We’ve all\r\ntaken a pledge that, not kept, will betray, not only God and our fellow man and\r\nnot only our family members, but ourselves! I can’t let you do that, Owen. Not\r\nwithout opposing you.\r\n“I cannot—”\r\n“Oh, stop! Father, stop, please!” I shouted, silencing him, sending him back\r\nbehind the light of the sun. At the edges, I saw Lyman and Susan step away, as if\r\nabout to flee. Mary had brought her hand to her mouth, and Ruth was rising\r\nfrom her stool, both of them looking at me as if my face were covered with\r\nblood. Which is indeed how I felt at that moment, as if my face were sheeted\r\nwith a spill of blood. “I can’t go, Father! And I can’t stay! I can’t give myself over\r\nto the slaves, and I can’t leave them! I can’t pray, and yet I can’t cease trying to\r\npray. I cannot believe in God, Father. But I can’t abandon my belief, either. What\r\nam I to do? Please, tell me. What am I to do?",
    "”\r\nHe reached out of the light then and placed both hands sweetly onto my\r\nshoulders and drew me to him in an embrace. “My poor boy,” he said in a voice\r\nalmost a whisper. “My poor boy.”\r\nMy thoughts and feelings were a tangled mass of contradictions, but his\r\nembrace settled them at once and straightened them and laid them down side by\r\nside in my mind, like logs of different sizes and kinds placed parallel to one\r\nanother. An unexpected, powerful wave of gratitude washed over me, when,\r\nsuddenly, I became aware of a clattering noise, the sound of boots against the\r\nfloor, the noise of several large people entering the dim room. I heard voices,\r\nOliver’s and Salmon’s, and the voices of several men—strangers.\r\nQuickly, I stepped back from Father and turned to see three men, accompanied\r\neagerly by Oliver, Salmon, and Watson behind, all six of them making their way\r\ninto the small room, the men with pack-baskets, their clothes mudded and\r\nswatched with briars and leaves, their dirty faces red and swollen from\r\nnumerous insect bites. They looked embarrassed to have come in upon us so\r\nabruptly and made awkward moves to get back outside, bumping one another\r\nand the boys behind, so there was for a moment a burly congestion at the door.\r\nFinally, one of the men, a tall, blond, bearded fellow, turned back to Father\r\nand smiled sheepishly and said, “I’m sorry, sir, but the lads said for us to come\r\nstraight inside. Forgive our rudeness for not first announcing ourselves.”\r\nFather moved straight to the man, and I found myself standing next to Lyman,\r\nwho gently touched my arm with his fingertips in a gesture of affection. In a\r\nformal and dry tone, Father said to the blond man, “I am John Brown. This is my\r\nfarm. How can I help you?",
    "”\r\nThe boys had removed themselves from the cabin, and the two other strangers\r\nhad followed and now stood in the yard, while the one who had spoken faced\r\nFather from the portal. He was of middle-age, tall and athletic-looking, but\r\nclearly not a hunter or woodsman or farmer: his clothing, although filthy and\r\nmatted with leaves and forest debris, was of too fine a cut, and his pack was a\r\nsportsman’s, not a hunter’s. I saw then that, despite his bright and polite manner,\r\nthe man was sick with insect bites—his face, neck, and hands were puffed up\r\nlike an adder. He and his companions appeared to have been stung a thousand\r\ntimes by mosquitoes and by the wretched clouds of black flies that populate the\r\nforests here. They swarm like a pestilence and are so numerous as to madden\r\nand blind a deer and drive it into the water and cause it to drown. If you don’t\r\ncover your skin with grease or carry a smutch, they can cloud out the light of\r\nday, fill your nostrils and ears, and swell up the flesh of your face until your eyes\r\nare forced shut.\r\nThe man then introduced himself as Mr. Richard Henry Dana, Esquire, of\r\nBoston. His companions, who had slouched to the ground next to the house in\r\napparent exhaustion, were a Mr. Metcalf and a Mr. Aikens, also of Boston, and\r\nall three, he said, were lawyers out on a wilderness holiday. They had come up\r\nfrom Westport, had passed several days visiting the mining village of Tahawus,\r\non the further side of Indian Pass, had ascended Mount Tahawus with a guide\r\nfrom the village, and then had struck out for North Elba on their own,\r\nanticipating a hike of some six or eight hours. But they had lost the blazes of the\r\ntrail, he explained, and had wandered through the thick, tangled forests for two\r\ndays with nothing for nourishment but a single trout caught with a bent pin and\r\npiece of red flannel by Mr. Aikens.",
    " “He thinks of himself as something of a\r\nwoodsman,” Mr. Dana said with a winning smile. Their one fire had been doused\r\nby rain, and the black flies had plagued them throughout their ordeal.\r\n“We ask you to spare us a little food, if you can,” Mr. Dana said to Father.\r\n“And allow us to sleep overnight here on the ground. And perhaps you’ll direct\r\nus on to North Elba and Osgood’s Tavern in the morning, where we’ve been\r\nexpected for two days now.”\r\nCalmly, Father directed Ruth to bring the men water and a pitcher of milk and\r\nsome corn bread and to feed them slowly, so they wouldn’t vomit it up. “We’ll\r\ngive you a proper meal later, when we all sit down for supper, but that should\r\nease you somewhat now,” he said, and he escorted the men outside, led the\r\nthree of them around to the shaded side of the house, and bade them lie down\r\nthere, while Ruth brought them nourishment and a salve for their insect bites.\r\nHe told Watson to bring the men a smutch against the flies and instructed the\r\nrest of us to attend to our labors—it was time to bring in the cattle and sheep.\r\nThere was work to be done, putting up the livestock and milking the cows and\r\nbuilding the cookfire in the stove, hauling water from the spring, bringing up a\r\nstring of trout from the river below, brushing down the horses for the night—the\r\ndaily round of work that we all fell to without a thought, as natural a part of our\r\nlives as breathing in and out.\r\nThe storm in my breast and mind had passed. But I knew that it would return.\r\nI knew also that it had weakened me so greatly that when it did return, I would\r\nbe even more dangerously tossed about than I had been today.",
    " I did not know\r\nwhat would bring it on—a cross word from Lyman, a disappointment concerning\r\nthe work with the Negroes, a further decline in Mary’s health, or an\r\nincomprehensible command from Father—but any one of these alone might be\r\nsufficient to set me off again. I was, during those first few weeks at North Elba,\r\nprecariously balanced between opposing commitments which were set to create\r\nthe shape of the rest of my life, and I knew that not to choose between them\r\nwould lead me inescapably to a resolution that expressed, not my will, but\r\nFather’s.\r\nMr. Dana was, of course, the world-famous author, who, many years later,\r\nafter Father’s execution had made him world-famous as well, published a\r\ndetailed account of his fortunate meeting with us that day at the edge of the\r\nwilderness. He described Ruth very nicely as “a bonny, buxom young woman of\r\nsome twenty summers, with fair skin and red hair,” and he praised her “good\r\nhumor, hearty kindness, good sense, and helpfulness.” He was complimentary\r\nalso to Mary. And even to me, whom he remembered as “a full-sized red-haired\r\nson, who seemed to be foreman of the farm.” Father he got right, and he even\r\nmentioned Lyman and his wife, Susan, exclaiming over the fact that they sat\r\nwith us at table that night and were introduced by Father to Mr. Dana and his\r\ncompanions properly and formally, with the prefixes Mr. and Mrs. Naturally, at\r\nthe time of his visit we did not know who he was. Nor did he know who we\r\nwere. To us, he and his companions were merely a set of pathetic city folks lost\r\nthree days in the woods. To him, we were a farm family settled in the\r\nwilderness, wholly admirable, exemplary even—an ideal American family of\r\nChristian yeomen. In his innocent eyes, we were bred to duty and principle, and\r\nheld to them, he wrote, by a power recognized by all as coming directly from\r\nabove.",
    "\r\nChapter 7\r\nHere, Miss Mayo, let me tell you a story, a true story, one of the very few ever\r\ntold of the Underground Railroad, for, as you must know by now, as soon as the\r\nCivil War began, the Underground Railroad was seen strictly as a preamble, and\r\na secret one at that. Its history, its true story, got lost, forgotten, dismissed, even\r\nby those whose lives were shaped by it, saved by it, sacrificed for it.\r\nBut that’s not what I’m intent on setting down here today, a lament or\r\ncomplaint. I merely want to tell you a small story, but one that will flower and\r\ngrow large with meaning later on, when you see it in the context of the larger\r\nstory, Father’s, not mine. Anyhow, let me commence. In the weeks that followed\r\nupon the events which I recently described to you, we Browns did indeed settle\r\ninto a life at the farm that corresponded to the author Mr. Dana’s somewhat\r\nfantastical view of us as exemplary American yeomen.\r\nFather and I divided the large attic into two chambers with sawn boards, and\r\nwith rocks taken from the brooks below the house, we constructed a second\r\nfireplace, so that in short order we had a proper farmhouse with a kitchen and\r\neating room, where Father and Mary slept, and a proper parlor downstairs, and\r\ntwo sleeping chambers upstairs for the rest of us. We rebuilt the old privy and\r\nrepaired and enlarged the crumbling barn and sheds so that we could adequately\r\nshelter our animals and store the hay and corn when they came in and firewood\r\nfor the winter.",
    " The boys spent most of their time clearing trees and extending\r\nour fields on both sides of the narrow road that passed by the house, cutting and\r\nburning the stumps and then planting vegetables in the burned-over ground, like\r\nIndians fertilizing the corn, potatoes, turnips, and other root crops with fish that\r\nthey pulled in great numbers from the streams that churned in those early days\r\nwith thick schools of silvery trout. Lyman, who was not especially skilled as a\r\nwoodcutter or farmer, but who had clever hands nonetheless, took to\r\nmanufacturing and repairing tools and harness for the farm: he constructed a\r\nfine chestnut harrow to follow the plow and an iron-railed sledge for hauling\r\nlogs out of the deep woods, and he and the Old Man set up a small tannery in\r\none of the sheds and commenced to tan the hides of the deer we shot and salted,\r\nand soon the women, Mary, Ruth, and Susan, were at work manufacturing shoes\r\nand leather aprons and other items of clothing to protect us against the\r\nelements.\r\nEvery morning, before beginning our day’s labor, we gathered together in the\r\nparlor for prayers and Father’s brief sermon, and even though I had grown long\r\nused to these solemn services, they nevertheless uplifted me, as I believe they\r\ndid the others, and made the day’s work easier, for despite my unbelief, the\r\nservices connected our labor to something larger than ourselves and our petty\r\ndaily needs.",
    " Father’s intention, I am sure, was precisely that—to lead us to\r\nunderstand our woodcutting and plowing and constant care of animals, the day-\r\nlong manufacture of our meals and the permanent ongoing repair of our tools\r\nand equipment, and our endless preparation for the long winter, such that we\r\nwould believe that we were participating in a great cycle of life, as if we were\r\ntiny arcs of an enormous curve, a universal template that began with birth and\r\nended with death and which, if participated in fully and without shirking, would\r\nlead us to a second and still larger cycle of rebirth and regeneration, to an\r\ninfinite spiral, as it were. Thus, as the fields were prepared and sown, so too\r\nwere our inner lives being prepared and sown, and as our land and our livestock\r\ngrew fruitful and multiplied, so did our spirits blossom and bear fruit, and as we\r\ndried and salted and stored our food and supplies in sawdust and hay for winter,\r\nso would our spirits and minds be prepared to endure the inescapable suffering\r\nand deaths of our loved ones, which would come to us as inevitably as the\r\nfreezing winds and the deep, drifting snows of winter.\r\nBut in those warm days of spring and early summer, as we settled into our\r\nfarm, the tumult that habitually inhabited my own mind was eased somewhat,\r\nand my earlier turbulence and confusion seemed almost to have occurred in the\r\nmind of another man than myself, some fellow younger than I, whose\r\nwrathfulness and turmoil had kept him from appreciating the singular beauty of\r\nthe place and the pleasures of hard work well done and the company of a large,\r\nskilled, and cheerfully employed family. Towards Lyman I felt a renewed sense\r\nof comradeships as if he were a brother, kin. and despite his having a wife, a\r\nwoman whom I grew quickly fond of, for her sober wit and decorum.",
    " My\r\nsquallish feelings of before appeared to wane and then to blow away like clouds\r\noff the mountains that daily stood before us in their forested summer majesty—\r\ngreat, green pillars holding up the sky—cloudsplitters, indeed.\r\nAs he had promised, the Old Man right away took himself off from the farm and\r\nbegan his survey of the lands granted by Mr. Gerrit Smith to the Negroes,\r\nassisted sometimes by me or Lyman, but increasingly accompanied by the\r\nsturdy, bearded fellow we had met on our first visit to Timbuctoo, a man who, as\r\nit turned out, was their unofficial chieftain and an altogether admirable\r\ngentleman. Elden Fleete was a freedman from Brooklyn, New York, a self-\r\neducated, somewhat bookish man whose mouth, like Father’s, was full of\r\nquotations from the Bible, but also from the plays of Shakespeare and authors of\r\nantiquity. He had been a printer and for many years had edited and published an\r\nabolitionist newspaper called The Gileadite, which circulated mainly among\r\nNegroes in Brooklyn and New York City and was little known elsewhere.\r\nAlthough to my mind it compared favorably to the better-known newspapers,\r\nsuch as The Liberator, published by William Lloyd Garrison—who, as I am well\r\naware, is your Professor Oswald Garrison Villard’s distinguished, and no doubt\r\nmuch admired, late grandfather. In my praise of Mr. Fleete’s little paper, I mean\r\nno criticism of your colleague’s ancestor.\r\nMr. Fleete, despite his bookishness, was a humorous, energetic man of high\r\nideals who had come to Timbuctoo not so much to own land and farm it as to\r\nhelp in the creation of an autonomous African community in the mountains of\r\nNorth America. He had come here strictly in order to establish a precedent and\r\nmodel for what he hoped would someday be a separate nation of Negro\r\nfreedmen on the North American continent.",
    " In those early days before the\r\nFugitive Slave Act and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, before it had become\r\ninescapably clear to everyone that the slavers had taken over every branch of the\r\ngovernment of the United States, abolitionists black and white were much\r\ndivided over how to deal with the fact that there were more than three million\r\npeople of African descent living in the United States. Regardless of how, or even\r\nwhether, slavery was banished from the land, so long as most whites regarded\r\nthem as inferior, these millions would remain here a despised, abject race\r\nincapable of rising to the level of white people. Certain Negroes, like Frederick\r\nDouglass, for example, and a few whites, like Father, persisted in believing that\r\nwhite people could eventually learn to regard Negroes as their equals; others\r\nthought that the only solution to the problem was to force all three million\r\nAmerican Negroes to return to Africa; and there were numerous positions\r\nbetween these two extremes. Mr. Fleete was among a small minority of black\r\nabolitionists who hoped that the United States government would establish in\r\nthe western territories a separate state for Negro freedmen, and he had been\r\ncalling for this in the pages of The Gileadite. The state would be named Gilead\r\nand would be ruled by a legislature and a governor elected by its citizenry. Its\r\npeople would be no more answerable to the government of the United States\r\nthan were the citizens of France or England. He had even written a constitution\r\nfor his nation of Gileadites, which was modeled closely on the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, except, of course, for the provisions therein designed to\r\nadvance and support chattel slavery.\r\nFather thought the notion of Gilead the height of absurdity and said so,\r\nfrequently and loud, but he had high regard for Mr.",
    " Fleete’s general intelligence\r\nand character, and as he was a man much admired by the other Negroes of\r\nTimbuctoo, the Old Man befriended him and worked easily with him in the\r\nseveral areas where they found agreement. They both recognized the need to\r\nmake a proper survey of the freedmen’s lands, they both felt the urgency of\r\nteaching the residents of Timbuctoo how best to survive as independent farmers\r\nand stockmen in this climate, and they agreed on the usefulness of establishing\r\nTimbuctoo as an actively operating station on the Underground Railroad.\r\nThey knew that the routes in the east along the Hudson and Champlain Valleys\r\nand in the west into Ontario by way of Niagara and Detroit were becoming\r\nincreasingly dangerous in those years and subject to betrayal and savage attack\r\nby pro-slavery people residing along the lines and by kidnappers hired by\r\nSouthern slaveholders. “The fact is, we’ve got to head up into the hills and move\r\nacross the ridges and peaks where we cannot be pursued,” the Old Man had\r\ndecided way back in Springfield. Also, he had long wished anyhow to establish\r\nan escape route for the slaves which would be protected, not by well-meaning\r\nwhites, but by heavily armed black men: he believed that only when the Negroes\r\nthemselves were able to threaten the slavers with deadly force would the cost of\r\nthe “peculiar institution” become so great as to crumble of its own weight. It was\r\nfrom these residents of Timbuctoo that he believed he would draw his initial\r\ncadre of armed black men.\r\nThus, with Mr. Fleete at his side, as soon as his surveys were finished and the\r\ndeeds registered at the county courthouse in Elizabethtown, Father at the first\r\nopportunity hiked the long way south to Indian Pass, crossing through the\r\ntangled forests where Mr.",
    " Dana, the author, and his Boston companions had\r\ngotten lost, on to the tiny village of Tahawus, which had been settled some years\r\nearlier for the purposes of mining iron ore from the red cliffs there. In that\r\nisolated place, living amongst a population of mostly Irish miners and their\r\nYankee supervisors, was a family named Wilkinson, people known to Father and\r\nMr. Fleete as dedicated and trustworthy abolitionists, who in the recent past had\r\nhidden an occasional escaped slave in their storage cellar or barn until such time\r\nas he or, as was sometimes the case, she could be passed along or directed\r\nnorthward through the forests to North Elba and thence on to Canada.\r\nThe head of the household, Mr. Jonas Wilkinson, in his capacity of engineer\r\nand geologist, had previously worked for Gerrit Smith on certain of his\r\nenterprises in the western section of the state of New York, having to do with the\r\nconstruction of canals, and it was through Mr. Smith that Father had first come\r\nto know of him. Mr. Fleete, of course, knew him strictly through his benevolence\r\ntowards the occasional escaped slave who passed through Tahawus and on to\r\nTimbuctoo.\r\nThe two, Mr. Fleete and Father, arranged to have Mr. Wilkinson notify them\r\nwhenever “cargo” sent from the South for trans-shipment north arrived at his\r\nhome. He was to send one of his sons through the forest to our place, and then\r\nFather and I, Mr. Fleete and Lyman Epps, carrying rifles as if on a hunt, would\r\ngo back with the boy, retrieve the cargo, and under cover of darkness transport\r\nit back to North Elba, where, as soon as possible, we would move it north by\r\nwagon to the next trans-shipping point, which at that time was Port Kent on\r\nLake Champlain, a mere forty miles south of the Canadian border.\r\nBy means of carefully worded letters to Mr.",
    " Smith at his home in Walpole,\r\nNew York, and to Frederick Douglass over in Rochester, the Old Man alerted\r\nmany of the agents, conductors, and stationmasters in downstate New York and\r\nPennsylvania and even as far south as Maryland that there was now an\r\neffectively manned link in the Underground Railroad that ran right up the center\r\nof New York State straight into the mountainous wilderness of the north, If we\r\nutilize this route, he wrote to Messrs. Smith and Douglass in a pair of letters which he\r\nasked me one evening to transcribe for him, there is unlikely to be any interference\r\nwith our shipments from those parties who remain hostile to our interests. It is my\r\nfond hope that in time this route can be extended southward through the Allegheny\r\nand Appalachian Mountains and that we will have reliable trans-shipping agents and\r\nconductors posted all the way to New Orleans. In a postscript, Father had me add, I\r\nmyself must first interview all who wish to join this enterprise, for, as you know, the\r\nstrength of any chain is determined by its weakest link.\r\nCautiously, I pointed out to him that it might prove impossible to interview\r\nthe agents and conductors, except for Mr. Wilkinson in Tahawus and the fellow\r\nin Port Kent, known to us only by name and reputation: Mr. Solomon Keifer was\r\na Quaker shipwright originally from Rhode Island, who for several years had\r\nbeen moving fugitive slaves north by boat. Father’s insistence on controlling\r\nevery aspect of the operation, I feared, would doom it, as it had doomed similar\r\nventures before.\r\nBut he would hear none of it. “If a thing can’t be done right, then it’s not\r\nworth doing,” he said. “It’s the Lord whose work this is, Owen, not Mister\r\nDouglass’s or Mister Smith’s. I trust only in the Lord. And in myself, who serves\r\nHim.",
    "”\r\nIf this venture failed, it would not be because Father hadn’t done his utmost to\r\nget the job done right. No, he declared, he would interview and appoint every\r\nman who wished to act as an agent or conductor for us. No exceptions. And if\r\nthat meant we could not extend our line and station now to those already in\r\nexistence among the slaves in the Southern states, well, then, so be it. We would\r\nfind another way to siphon off the human chattel from the plantations, another\r\nway to bring about the collapse of that satanic institution. “We will triumph in\r\nthe end,” he insisted. “But the end may be much further off than we realize, and\r\nwhen it comes, it may appear in terms that we cannot now imagine. In the\r\nmeantime, Owen, we must trust our principles large and small, for the end is\r\nalways and forever the Lord’s, and thus will take care of itself, with or without\r\nus.”\r\nWho could argue with him? Certainly not I—who at that age had too little\r\nexperience of the world, of the Lord’s will, and of slavery to know that he was\r\nwrong, and too little command of language and the forms of reasoning to name\r\nand rebut his fallacies. I was not altogether a passive or unquestioningly\r\nobedient son, but I was aware of my own limitations and so allowed him to rule\r\nme, in spite of our frequent disagreements and disputes.\r\nLate one bright afternoon in early June, Mr. Wilkinson’s young son, Daniel, a\r\nboy about the age of Watson, fourteen or fifteen, appeared at our farm bearing\r\nthe information that cargo had arrived in Tahawus, trans-shipped from the town\r\nof New Trenton in Oneida County. Mary, who was beginning by then to recover\r\nfrom her malady, although she was not yet able to take on any of the heavy\r\nhousehold duties, welcomed the boy in and gave him something to eat.",
    "\r\nMeanwhile, Oliver chased down Father, who was off in Timbuctoo helping to\r\nraise a barn, and Salmon came for me, who that afternoon had gone with\r\nWatson to build an Indian-style fishing weir on the tableland below, where the\r\nwest branch of the Au Sable passed through a rocky gorge on a corner of our\r\nland. Lyman remained waiting at the farm, where he had been constructing a\r\nsmall forge for smithing next to the tannery that he and Father had built.\r\nIt was nearly dusk before we all—Father, me, Lyman, and Mr. Fleete—\r\nforgathered at the house and then with considerable excitement struck out with\r\nthe Wilkinson lad for Tahawus, a good eight hours’ hike away. The boy was\r\nintelligent and articulate and proud to have been given such a heavy\r\nresponsibility, and as we walked rapidly along, he conveyed his father’s message\r\nto us in bits, barely restraining his pleasure. He told us that a Negro man and his\r\nwife, both in a somewhat debilitated condition, had arrived the previous night.\r\nThey had been forwarded by Mr. Frederick Douglass himself and had come\r\nmostly under cover of night alone from Utica, along cart tracks and footpaths\r\nthrough the woods all the way to the Wilkinsons’ house. They were from\r\nRichmond, Virginia, and had run off a fancy James River estate, had nearly been\r\ncaught twice and were terrified of being returned to their owner, who they\r\nbelieved would separate them by selling the man off as a field hand to Alabama,\r\nwhere their owner had interests in a cotton plantation. They were a well-spoken\r\ncouple, he said, and claimed they could read and write. And there was a\r\nconsiderable reward for their return, he added as a warning, for he knew that\r\nthis fact increased the danger of transporting them.",
    "\r\nI believe that this was the first time that young Daniel had been personally\r\ninvolved with helping slaves to escape, and the thing was for him a considerable\r\nadventure. For Father and me, of course, it was a welcome resumption of the\r\nactivity that had given us so much extreme satisfaction back in Ohio and\r\nPennsylvania, when we used to take off into the hills of Virginia and Maryland\r\nor drive down along the Ohio River with John and Jason and be gone from\r\nhome for days transporting whole wagonloads of escaped slaves north to\r\nCanada, traveling at night and hiding out in the barns of Quakers and other\r\nsympathizers or camping in the deep woods during the daylight hours. We had\r\nnot been able to participate in this activity since Father’s removal east to\r\nSpringfield, partially because there was in Springfield an already functioning\r\nnetwork of abolitionist transporters who were white and with whom Father\r\nwould not cooperate, and also because, with all the demands of the woolen\r\nbusiness there, he simply could not take off and turn day into night carrying\r\nNegroes under tarpaulins in the back of a wagon racing down country roads.\r\nAlso, in Springfield, there had been other venues available to his activism.\r\nFor Mr. Fleete, this was a great opportunity; without the material support and\r\nprotection of the Old Man, he had up to now been limited to only the most\r\npassive of roles in aiding the escapes of his enslaved brethren. Lyman Epps, like\r\nalmost every freedman in those days, wished to work on the Underground\r\nRailroad, but he also had a young man’s natural desire to test himself under fire.",
    "\r\nAs it was highly unlikely that we would meet up with a bounty-hunting slave-\r\ncatcher and be obliged to defend our cargo against seizure or that we would be\r\nseriously opposed by any local people up here in the mountains, this was a\r\nperfect opportunity for Lyman to do both without risking much. In those years,\r\nmost of the settlers in the Adirondacks were New Englanders, people who, even\r\nif not wholly sympathetic with the work being done by the radical abolitionists,\r\nwere nonetheless unwilling to obstruct it, so long as they themselves were not\r\nput in physical or legal danger. They did not like Negroes, but they did not\r\nespecially want to help those who enslaved them. If others wished to move them\r\nthrough to Canada, fine, they would not interfere. Even so, we had to be\r\nprepared for any emergency, and thus we marched on to Tahawus under cover\r\nof darkness, and armed.\r\nIn the weeks since we first arrived and took up residence there, we had grown\r\nincreasingly familiar with the forest pathways that linked the various\r\nAdirondack settlements, so that now, even at night, we were in no great danger\r\nof getting lost, especially since there was a bright, nearly full moon floating\r\noverhead. Most of the footpaths we used had been deer tracks laid down in\r\nancient times in the narrow valleys and defiles and along the connecting ridges,\r\nfollowed later by the Algonquin and Iroquois Indians, who never settled here but\r\nfor hundreds of years had fought each other for control of the region as a\r\nhunting preserve. Once you had in your mind a map of the land and understood\r\nthe logic of its topography, you could pretty well predict where the path from\r\none place to another would be found.",
    " In our first weeks in North Elba, Watson,\r\nSalmon, Oliver, and I had explored all the woods for several miles around the\r\nfarm and Timbuctoo and felt as much at home there now as we had back in the\r\nneat villages and cultivated fields of Ohio. Wed even taken to racing one another\r\nafter work up several of the nearby mountains and back to the house before\r\nsupper, vying amongst us to find the quickest route up and down Pitch-off or\r\nSentinel. Mr. Fleete and Lyman, of course, knew the woods intimately, for they\r\nhad resided there for nearly three years by then, and Father’s recent tramping\r\nover thousands of acres of field and forest with his surveying instruments had\r\ngiven him a refined intelligence concerning the neighborhood. When a place\r\nenters your daily life, you quickly lose your fear of it, and I almost had to laugh\r\nat my first awestruck, fearful impressions of these forested mountains and\r\nvalleys barely a month earlier, when we came up from Elizabethtown and Keene.\r\nIt was nearly dawn, and the moon had long since set behind us, when we\r\nfinally exited from the woods south of Indian Pass and approached the mines\r\nand furnaces of Tahawus and the settlement that surrounded them. We were\r\nmaking our way down a long, rock-strewn slope that appeared to have been\r\nburned clear in recent years.\r\nHovering over the marshes and stream below us, a pale haze reflected back the\r\nmorning light, with the dark, pointed tips of tall pines poking through. The\r\nvillage was an encampment, made up mostly of shanties for the Irish miners\r\nwhich, in their sad disarray and impoverishment, reminded me of the shanties of\r\nTimbuctoo, and as we passed by, we could see the miners emerging from their\r\ncold, damp hovels—gaunt, grim, gray-faced men and boys rising to begin their\r\nlong day’s work in the darkness of the earth.",
    " Behind them, standing at the door\r\nor hauling water or building an outdoor cookfire, were their brittle-looking\r\nwomen, downtrodden creatures in shabby sack frocks who looked too old to\r\nhave given birth to the babies they carried on their bony hips.\r\nThey barely looked up at us as we passed, so borne down by their labors were\r\nthey. We fell silent, as if out of respect—two white men and two black men\r\ncarrying rifles come from the woods, led by the son of the company\r\nsuperintendent. As we passed close to the open door of one of the shacks, Father\r\ntouched the brim of his palm-leaf hat and nodded to a woman who stood there\r\nand seemed to be watching us, her round Irish face impassive, expressionless, all\r\nbut dead to us. “Good morning, m’am,” Father said in a soft voice. She made no\r\nresponse. Her eyes were pale green and glowed coldly in the dim light of the\r\ndawn but seemed to see nothing. She looked like a woman who had been cast off\r\nand left like trash by an invading army.\r\nThe haze from the stream below had risen along the slope to the village,\r\nslowly enveloping it, erasing from our sight one by one the shanties and the\r\npoor, sullen souls who lived there, following us like a pale beast as we made our\r\nway along the muddy track that ran through the encampment. When we reached\r\nthe further edge, we saw ahead of us, situated on a pleasant rise of land, a\r\nproper house with a porch and an attached barn, the home of the supervisor of\r\nthe mines, Mr. Jonas Wilkinson. There I turned and, for an instant, looked back,\r\nand the miners’ camp was gone, swallowed by the fog.\r\nMr. Wilkinson told us, “They run off to a surprising degree, the Irish. Though\r\nthey’ve got nothing to run to, except back to the wharfs of Boston or New York.\r\nA lot of them are sickly by the time they get here and end up buried in the field\r\nyonder. They’re a sad lot.” Mr.",
    " Wilkinson was a round, blotch-faced man with\r\nthinning black hair and a porous-looking red nose that suggested a long-indulged\r\naffection for alcohol. “Ignorant and quarrelsome and addicted to drink,” he said.\r\n“The females as much as the men. And you can’t do much to improve them.\r\nAlthough my wife and I have certainly given it a try, she by schooling the little\r\nones and me by preaching every Sunday to them that will listen. But they breed\r\nfaster than you can teach them, and when it comes to proper religion, Mister\r\nBrown, they’re practically pagans. Superstitious papists without a priest is what\r\nthey are. I’ve about given up on ‘em and just try now to get as much work out\r\nof’em with as little expense as possible before they run off, or die.\r\n“Sorry for sounding so harsh,” he said to Father, who sat on a straight chair\r\nand grimly regarded the floor. “But what you’ve got with these Irish is the dead\r\nends of European peasantry. There’s little for them in this country. Little enough\r\nfor them back there in their own country, I suppose,“he added, pulling on his\r\nchin. “Which, of course, is why they come over in the first place. For them, poor\r\nsouls, I suppose it’s an improvement. They get to start their lives over.”\r\nFather stood then and said to Mrs. Wilkinson, who was putting a substantial\r\nbreakfast on the table for us, “M’am, if you don’t mind, I believe we’ll eat with\r\nthe Negroes in the barn and then rest there until nightfall.”\r\n“I sense that I’ve offended you, Mister Brown,” Mr. Wilkinson said. “No, sir.\r\nNo, you haven’t,” the Old Man answered. “I am curious, though, as to your\r\nreasons for agreeing to aid us in our efforts to carry Negro slaves off to Canada,\r\nwhen you appear to have so little fellow-feeling for the poor indentured men and\r\nwomen in your charge here.”\r\n“Ah!” Mr.",
    " Wilkinson said brightly—he’d heard this argument before and was\r\nprepared, even eager, to answer it. “Slavery is evil! That alone is reason enough\r\nfor a Christian man to want to aid and abet you. But beyond that, slavery\r\nprovides the Southerners with an unfair advantage in the labor market. No, sir,\r\nfor the economic health of our nation, we all must do what we can to bring\r\nabout the end of slave labor. And this is simply my small part, aiding you and\r\nyour son and your Negro friends here, and your friend the famous Mister\r\nDouglass.”\r\nHe pointed out that every one of his Irish miners had freely contracted to work\r\nhere, just as he himself had, and when their terms were over and they had met\r\nthe requirements of their contracts, they were free to go. Indeed, many of them,\r\nhe said, chose not to leave and continued on here in the mines. This was not\r\nslavery, he said, smiling broadly. “Your Negroes know the difference, I’m sure, if\r\nyou and your son do not. Ask the Negroes which they would prefer. Slavery in\r\nthe South, or working as a free man here in the iron mines of Tahawus?” He\r\nlooked to Mr. Fleete and Lyman, as if for an answer, but they remained\r\nexpressionless.\r\nFather simply said, “I see. Well, I am grateful to you for your help and for your\r\nkindness to us. But I do think, all the same, that we’ll take ourselves to the barn\r\nnow, for I wish to speak with our poor passengers out there, who are no doubt\r\nfeeling anxious about their situation and require from us a bit of reassurance.\r\nThey are, after all, in the hands of strangers and in a strange land.”\r\nEagerly, and evidently pleased that he had made himself understood if not\r\nadmired, Mr. Wilkinson escorted us from the room, leading us through a narrow\r\nwoodshed that connected to the barn.",
    " He said that he would send his wife along\r\nwith our breakfast and pointed us towards the hayloft above, where we saw\r\nlooking nervously down at us the faces of the man and woman who had been\r\nhidden there the previous night.\r\nAs soon as Mr. Wilkinson had left us, Mr. Fleete stepped forward in the dark\r\nroom, smiled up at the young man and woman, and said his own name, then\r\nintroduced Lyman Epps, Father, and me, in that order. “It’s safe to come down,”\r\nMr. Fleete assured the fugitives. “Help them down,” he said to Lyman, who\r\nscrambled up the ladder and assisted first the woman and then the man in\r\ndescending to the floor of the barn, where we all somberly shook hands. After\r\nweeks of running from the hounds of slavery, of trusting white and Negro\r\nstrangers not to betray them, of hiding out in ditches and under bridges and\r\ntrestles, of going days and nights without food or sleep, they were almost too\r\ntired to be frightened—but, nonetheless, their eyes darted warily from one of us\r\nto the other, for who knew, this could be no more than a white man’s clever\r\ntrap.\r\nThen suddenly, before anyone had a chance to speak and reassure them, Mrs.\r\nWilkinson entered from the house, carrying a tray of corn bread and eggs and\r\nsmoked pork and a pitcher of fresh milk. “I’ll be sure that no one disturbs you,”\r\nshe said cheerfully, and headed back into the house.\r\nFather looked at me, clear irritation on his face. “Disturb us?” he said in a low\r\nvoice. “These Wilkinsons have it all wrong. They can’t be trusted.”\r\nI knew that, as soon as we got back to North Elba, the Old Man would cut\r\ntheir link from the chain. And with no stationmaster to replace them, the line\r\nfrom the Deep South to here to Timbuctoo would be broken.",
    " Better, I thought, to\r\nlet the Wilkinsons continue to have it all wrong and keep the Railroad running\r\nthan to try to teach them what’s right by putting them off it.\r\nWe fell to devouring the food, all six of us—not, of course, until Father had\r\nsaid an eloquent, if somewhat lengthy, blessing. The fugitives, we quickly\r\nlearned, were named Emma and James Cannon, and they could not have been\r\nolder than twenty-one, which was unusual: most of the escaped slaves whom we\r\nhad aided in the past had been closer to middle-age or else were small children\r\nin the company of one or both parents. Occasionally, a young man came through\r\nunattached—angry, scarred with old wounds, and still bleeding from new—a\r\nman defiant from youth, with a runaway cast of mind and a hundred lashes on\r\nhis back to show for it. These two, however, were almost genteel in their ways,\r\nshy and decorous, the least likely type of slave to risk flight: one could say, if\r\none did not regard the condition of slavery itself as pain beyond all sorrow, that\r\nthey had not yet suffered enough to justify the hardship and chanciness of flight.\r\nBut the degradation and humiliation and the invasion and theft of a person’s\r\nsoul made possible by the legal ownership of that person’s body can occur\r\nwithout leaving any visible scars on the body, and that is frequently what\r\nhappened to the youngest and most delicate of enslaved women and men. As\r\nwas, no doubt, the case with the man and woman before us, whose owner, they\r\ntold us, had been powerful in the Virginia state legislature, a wealthy exporter of\r\ntobacco, and a partner in several vast Alabama cotton plantations. Emma\r\nCannon had served as maid to her owner’s wife and had resided in their\r\nmansion; James Cannon had been a clerk in the tobacco warehouse.",
    "\r\nThis was briefly and indirectly the story they told, or, rather, it was what I\r\ndeciphered of their hushed account, as they answered Mr. Fleete’s and Lyman’s\r\npolite questions, while Father and I sat back a ways and listened in silence. They\r\nhad been married without their owner’s consent or knowledge, and when the\r\nslave-master had begun to express carnal desires towards the young woman, she\r\nand her new husband had decided to flee, for she would have had no alternative\r\nbut to accede to her owner’s quickening advances. The reward for their capture\r\nwas sufficiently large, one thousand five hundred dollars for the woman and one\r\nthousand for the man, that they had no choice but to flee straight through to\r\nCanada, avoiding wherever possible the more popular and well-known routes.\r\nI thought, the woes of women always exceed those of the men who love them\r\nand are sworn to protect them and fail. I could not take my eyes from the tired,\r\nplacid face of this gold-colored woman. With her head wrapped in a white\r\nbandana, she seemed to me wholly accepting of the chaos and danger that\r\nsurrounded her here and that had pursued her and would follow her from here,\r\nand she seemed strangely beautiful for that. Especially when I compared her face\r\nto the darker face of her husband, who appeared more frightened than she,\r\nnervous and twitchy, a young man who was probably suffering serious regret for\r\nhaving fled the known world, even a precinct in hell, for these unknown forests\r\nof the far north.\r\nLater, when Father entered the conversation and began interrogating the\r\nyoung man and woman with regard to the character and abilities of the\r\nnumerous stationmasters and conductors who had brought them this far, I found\r\nmyself a comfortable corner of the barn, spread some straw, and lay down. Soon\r\nI found myself falling into a sort of reverie.",
    " The images of women—white\r\nwomen and black, sick and dying or aged beyond their years—began to haunt\r\nme like ghosts, or more like furies, all of them enraged at me for having\r\nabandoned them to their terrible fates. It was not exactly dream, not exactly\r\nfantasy, either, and I might have dispelled it by simply standing up and crossing\r\nthe large, dark room to where Father and the others sat. But instead I fairly well\r\ninvited the figures straight into my mind: the sullen, pale face of the Irish\r\nwoman with the morning mist rising around her—abandoned by me, who had\r\nbarely looked behind when we passed; and the scared, bewildered face of the\r\ngirl humiliated by me in the Springfield alley; and the vulnerable, exhausted, yet\r\nprofoundly willful face of the woman here in the barn across from me—a man\r\nwho could not save her, any more than her poor husband could, from the\r\nmemories of enslavement and the brutal lust of the man who had owned her;\r\nand the face of my stepmother, Mary, who had married at the age of nineteen,\r\ninherited five of another woman’s children, then borne eleven more and seen six\r\nof those eleven die, four going in that terrible winter of ’43, the last dying in\r\ninfancy only two months ago—and neither I nor their father could save a one of\r\nthem. Then the faces of the women swirled and merged and became the face of\r\nmy own mother, whom I would never see again, not on this earth and not in\r\nheaven, either, who was gone, simply that—gone from me and located nowhere\r\nelse in this perversely cruel universe, which first gives us life amongst others and\r\nthen takes the others off, one by one, until we are left alone, all of us, alone.\r\nI lay on my side with my coat drawn over my head and squeezed my eyes\r\nshut.",
    " It has been this way for women and men and their children, I thought, for\r\nthousands of years, from tribal times till this modern age, and it will be this way\r\nforever. Was this, then, that great cycle of birth, life, and death which my father\r\nspoke of with such admiration and belief? The cycle of women, strange\r\ncreatures, so like us men and yet so different from us, giving birth and watching\r\nhelplessly as their children die, or dying themselves on the birthing bed, or, if\r\nnot, then growing old too soon, while the sons who survive grow up to become\r\nthe husbands, fathers, and brothers who exhaust themselves failing in the\r\nattempt to save them, and who then, having failed, spin the wheel again and\r\nimpregnate them in the dark of night or on the back stairs or in the low attics of\r\nthe servant quarters—was this Father’s great cycle of life?\r\nThe fugitives’ story had set my mind to working in this morbid way, despite\r\nmy best attempts to think of other things, to think even of the mild adventure\r\nthat we men of North Elba were set on. I knew the likely story, the tale of rape\r\nthat the young woman across from me was not telling us, that she was perhaps\r\nnot even telling her poor husband. I had heard that tale in many of its lurid\r\nforms over the years, and there was no reason to think that she, uniquely, had\r\nnot been used by her owner to satisfy his sexual desires and that, risking death,\r\nshe had not fled her owner more to save her husband than her own violated self.\r\nHer owner! After all these years of hearing it spoken, the word still had the\r\npower to shock and repel me. A human being actually owned another, he could\r\nuse her in any way he wished, and he could sell her if he wished, as if she were\r\nan unwanted article of clothing.",
    " And he owned her husband as well—a fact that\r\nmade of their pledge of themselves in marriage, one to the other, a dark joke, a\r\nsickening, cruel fancy.\r\nI slept and woke and slept again, and when I woke a second time, seated on\r\nthe floor next to me was Mr. Fleete, leaning against a post and smoking his pipe\r\nin a meditative way. I asked him, “Do you have a wife or children, Mister\r\nFleete?”\r\n“No. My wife is dead, Mister Brown. She died young. At about the age of that\r\nwoman yonder. Died without children.”\r\n“And you never thought to marry again?”\r\nHe sighed and studied the pipe in his brown hand. A silver strand of smoke\r\ncurled upwards in the dim light towards the one small window high overhead.\r\n“Well, y’ know, I thought of it now and again, yes. Especially as regards\r\nchildren.”\r\n“Do you think you will marry, then?”\r\n“No, Mister Brown. The world does not need more children. And no woman\r\nneeds me for a husband. The one who did,”he said, “is dead. But I’ll be seeing\r\nher again in the sweet bye an’ bye. Won’t I?” he added, and smiled lightly, as if\r\nhe did not quite believe his own words.\r\n“Yes,” I said, and turned away to sleep again, to dream the childhood faces of\r\nmy sisters, Ruth and Annie and Sarah, each one exchanging her place with the\r\nothers in my dream, as if the three were one and as if present were mingled with\r\npast. In the dream, I was their father, not their brother, yet I was myself and not\r\nFather. They were all, first one, then two, then three female children wailing in\r\nsorrow, and I was pacing hectically around them, like the blindfolded horse tied\r\nto the bark-crusher, marching in a fixed circle, while the three little girls stood\r\ncrying in the center, lashed to the pole like witches condemned to be burned.",
    " I\r\ncould not tell if I myself had tied them there or instead was marching in a circle\r\naround them to protect them from those who would place sticks at their feet and\r\nset them afire.\r\nWhen I woke again, it was closer to midday, and a pillar of light fell straight\r\ndown from the high window onto the board floor of the barn. I stood and walked\r\nacross to where Lyman lay on his back atop a saddle blanket, staring at the\r\ndistant ceiling, lost in thought. The others appeared to be asleep—except for\r\nFather, who sat on guard by the door, with his rifle across his knees. His eyes\r\nfollowed me, but his head did not move as I came and sat next to my friend.\r\n“Lyman,” I said in a voice almost a whisper.\r\n“Hello, Owen,” he said without looking at me.\r\n“I want to ask you about your wife, Susan. Did you come out of slavery with\r\nher?”\r\n“Susan?”\r\n“I’m sorry. I know that I haven’t inquired much about her,” I said awkwardly.\r\n“She’s somewhat... shy.”\r\n“So she is. But mainly amongst white folks.”\r\n“I’m sorry for that.”\r\n“Not your fault, Owen.”\r\n“Well, did you?”\r\n“What?”\r\n“Come out of slavery together.”\r\n“No. She come north alone. Come out from Charleston, stowed away on a\r\ntimber boat and sneaked ashore in New Jersey. Down in Carolina, Susan was\r\nowned by a crazy man, and she’d a killed him if she hadn’t run off first.”\r\n“You don’t have any children,” I said.\r\n“No. No, we don’t. Susan has children, though. Three of them. They got sold\r\noff south, sent to Georgia someplace, she don’t know where.”\r\nWe were silent for a moment. Finally, I asked, “What about their father?”\r\n“What about him?”\r\n“Well, who was he?”\r\nLyman turned and looked at me, said nothing, and returned his gaze to the\r\nceiling.\r\nI stood then and went back to my corner, where I lay down on the floor and\r\nwrapped my coat around my head again as if to shut out the world and drifted\r\nback into a lurid sleep.",
    "\r\nLater, to Father, I said, “Tell me about my grandmother. Your mother.\r\nGrandfather’s first wife. I know little more than her name, Ruth. And that she\r\ndied young, when you were a boy.”\r\n“Yes,” he said, and looked away from me. “And I loved my mother beyond\r\nmeasure. Her kindness and piety were great... greater than that of any person,\r\nman or woman, I have since known.”\r\n“When she died, were you as bereft as I when my mother died?” “Yes, Owen. I\r\nsurely was. Which is why I took such pity on you then, and why I feel that in\r\nmany ways I understand you now somewhat better than I understand your older\r\nbrothers, who suffered less. I was like you, I was barely eight years old, when my\r\nmother died. And when Father remarried, I found it difficult to make a place in\r\nmy heart for my stepmother.”\r\n“I’ve long since come to love Mary as my own mother,” I said to him.\r\nHe turned to me. “No, Owen,” he said. “You have not. Although I know you do\r\nlove her. But it is your own true mother whom you still hold yourself for, as if\r\nawaiting her return. She won’t return, Owen. You’ll have to go to her. And if you\r\nbelieve you’re bound to be with her again in heaven, then you’ll be free to leave\r\noff this painful waiting and longing that keeps you from opening your heart to\r\nyour stepmother, and to all other women as well.” He knew this, he said,\r\nbecause it had been a danger to him also, and if it had not been for his Christian\r\nfaith, he would feel today as he had over forty years before, when his own\r\nmother died. “I cannot help you, son. Only the Lord can help you.”\r\nI stood and walked away from him without saying anything more and returned\r\nto my place in the room.\r\nOf the young man, James Cannon, I asked, “Do you have family in Canada\r\nwho will help you settle there?",
    "”\r\nHe did not look at me when he spoke, but kept his large, wet eyes fixed before\r\nhim, as if contemplating something that he could not share with me, a memory,\r\na childhood fear or sorrow. “Family? No, not exactly, Mister Brown. But I ’spect\r\nfolks will be there to help settle us. Leastways, so I hear. Mister Douglass done\r\nmade the arrangements.”\r\n“Everything will be different now, won’t it? Escaping from slavery is like a\r\nresurrection, isn’t it? A new life.”\r\nSlowly, he turned his head and gazed wide-eyed at me, as if puzzled by my\r\nwords. “More like birth, I’d say, Mister Brown. Resurrection is where you gets to\r\nbe born again.”\r\n“What is the name of the man who was your master?”\r\n“His name? Name Samuel;’ he said. “Mister Samuel Cannon.”\r\n“The same as yours.”\r\n“Yes, Mister Brown, same as mine. Same as his father, too. Same as my\r\nmother.”\r\n“So you were born a slave to Mister Samuel Cannon, and your mother was\r\nborn his father’s slave?”\r\n“Yes, Mister Brown. She surely wasn’t Mas’ Cannon’s wife.”\r\n“Who was your father, then? What happened to him?”\r\nHe looked away from me again. “Don’t know. Long gone.”\r\nLyman watched me from a few feet away, listening. Mr. Fleete was asleep;\r\nacross the room, still seated by the door with his rifle across his knees, Father\r\nlightly dozed. The woman, Emma Cannon, lay on her side next to her husband,\r\nwith her back to us, and I could not see if she was asleep.\r\n“Forgive me forasking,”I said in a low voice. “But your wife, Emma. Was her\r\nname also Cannon? I mean, before you married her?”\r\nHe was a young man, several years younger than I, but at that moment, when\r\nhe turned his large, dark face towards me and for a few seconds studied my face,\r\nhe appeared decades, epochs, whole long eons, older than I, and weary,\r\nendlessly weary, of my innocence.",
    " And when I saw his expression, it was as if in\r\na single stroke I’d finally lost that punishing innocence, and I felt ashamed of my\r\ninquiry. I said, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked into your personal affairs.\r\nForgive me, please.”\r\nHe must have despised me that afternoon, despised all us whites, the\r\nWilkinsons and even Father and every one of the other, more or less well-\r\nintentioned, white conductors and stationmasters whose extended hands he and\r\nhis wife had been obliged to grasp—hating us not in spite of our helping them to\r\nescape from slavery but because of it. In ways that were not true for Mr. Fleete\r\nand Lyman, we were unworthy of helping him and his young wife. And the\r\nterrible irony which trapped us all was that our very unworthiness was precisely\r\nthe thing that obliged us to help them in the first place.\r\nAt nightfall, Mrs. Wilkinson brought food to us a second time, potatoes and a\r\nsubstantial leg of mutton, and when we had eaten, Mr. Wilkinson came and\r\ncheerfully bade us farewell and let us out of the barn by a back door, into the\r\ndark, adjacent woods. Making our way down towards the valley below the\r\nhouse, we kept to the birch trees, as Mr. Wilkinson had urged, so as not to be\r\nseen by the men returning to their hovels from the mines. For both good and bad\r\nreasons, although he did not detail them to us, Mr. Wilkinson did not want his\r\nIrish workers to know of his involvement with the Underground Railroad.\r\nHidden by the darkness, as we passed among the thick white trunks of the\r\nbirch trees, we saw the miners. They were illuminated by the flickering light of\r\nthe whale oil lanterns they carried—shadowy, slumped figures moving silently\r\nuphill.",
    " It was like a march of dead souls that we observed, and the image\r\ntroubled me, and I found myself lingering behind the others, hanging back,\r\nfighting a strange impulse to leave the darkness and join them, to fall into line\r\nwith the returning miners and merge my life with theirs.\r\nFather grabbed at my sleeve. “Come, Owen,” he said. “I know what you feel,\r\nson. Come away. We cannot help them,” he said, and I turned reluctantly from\r\nthem and followed my father and the four Negroes into the forest.\r\nShortly before dawn, we emerged from the deep pine woods on the road just\r\nbelow our farm, where Mr. Fleete parted from us to return to his cabin in\r\nTimbuctoo. He would not be joining us for the next stage of our journey, from\r\nNorth Elba to Port Kent, nor would Lyman, for our route would carry us through\r\nseveral villages and a generally more settled region than the wilderness of the\r\npass between North Elba and Tahawus, and we did not want to attract undue\r\nattention to our wagon, as would surely occur if we were in the company of even\r\none of “Gerrit Smith’s North Elba niggers,’ as the settlers of Timbuctoo were\r\ncalled by the local whites. While there were indeed a number of white\r\nabolitionists residing in the region, the Thompson family foremost among them,\r\nalso the Nashes, the Edmondses, and some others, anti-Negro feeling was\r\nstarting to run high here, amongst the small farmers in particular, who believed\r\nthat, thanks to Mr. Smith’s land grants and now Father’s survey, the Negroes had\r\nobtained unfair access to the better part of the tablelands. This resentment fed\r\non the usual racial prejudices of poor and ignorant white farmers and was\r\nfattened by the oily words of land speculators and politicians working to please\r\nthe money-lenders.",
    " Father’s association with the Negroes was, of course, well\r\nknown, and the several Sunday sermons that he had given at the invitation of\r\nMr. Everett Thompson, who was a much-respected deacon in the North Elba\r\nPresbyterian Church, had enflamed many of the local people against us, and\r\nconsequently we had begun appearing in public with Negroes whenever\r\npossible. “We must not act in the presence of our neighbors as men who are\r\nashamed of doing the Lord’s work,” the Old Man had insisted, when I counseled\r\ncaution. “We must force them to confront us, and from that they will in time\r\nconfront their own consciences, so that when the spirit of the Lord enters them,\r\nthey will know what is right and will act accordingly.”\r\nBut Father was no fool, and he knew that it would be dangerous all around to\r\ninvite any such confrontation while transporting escaped slaves in our wagon,\r\nand thus he was obliged to dissuade both Mr. Fleete and Lyman from traveling\r\non with us. Mr. Fleete seemed almost grateful to be let off from it, but Lyman\r\nwas not. “You might wish I was along, Mister Brown, if some slave-catcher come\r\nupon you,” he said, as we walked along the road to our farm. The sun was rising\r\nfull in our face, cracking the horizon just south of the notch. Father and Lyman\r\nmarched in front, and Mr. and Mrs. Cannon and I came wearily along behind.\r\nThe long hike through Indian Pass from Tahawus had taken several hours longer\r\nthan the walk over the night before, as the fugitives were not shod as well as we\r\nand, despite the rigors of their flight, were not used to tramping at such length\r\nthrough rough terrain.\r\n“You may be sure that Owen and I can ably defend our cargo, if need be,”\r\nFather said to Lyman. I myself was not so sure. At that time I had not yet fired\r\nmy gun at another human being, and to my knowledge the Old Man hadn’t,\r\neither.",
    "\r\nAs we rounded the bend before our house, Father suddenly halted and drew\r\nback and hurried us all into the chokecherry bushes by the side of the road. He\r\nbade us get down out of sight and silenced us with the flat of his hand. “We have\r\nvisitors,’ he whispered. “Two horses at the front of the house.”\r\nThere was a narrow gully that ran back from the road into a dense thicket of\r\nsilver birch, and Father instructed the fugitives to hide there. “Do not move until\r\none of us comes for you,” he instructed them, and at once the man and woman\r\nslipped away from us into the gully and out of sight. Then he, Lyman, and I\r\napproached the house.\r\nThere were two men lounging at the door, one of them known to us—Caleb\r\nPartridge from Keene. The other was a long, leathery fellow with a patchwork\r\ngray and black beard on his face and the squint and facial color of a man who\r\nspent most of his time outdoors, although the clothes he wore belied that—a\r\nbrown suit and waistcoat and a tall black felt hat. He wore strapped to his waist,\r\nin stark contrast to his clothing, a holstered Colt Paterson, a five-shot revolver,\r\nthe sort of sidearm one usually associated with a police officer or Pinkerton\r\nagent. He was a manhunter. The other fellow, Partridge, although unarmed,\r\nlooked to be his assistant today, or perhaps his guide.\r\nAs we approached them, Partridge smiled. Watson and Salmon were just\r\nsetting out the cattle and sheep to graze in the near meadow, and I saw Oliver in\r\nthe distance behind the barn, carrying water and grain to the pigs and feed to\r\nthe fowl. Annie and Sarah were at play with their husk dolls on a stump in the\r\nyard beside the house. Ruth and Mary and Lyman’s wife, Susan, were nowhere\r\nto be seen, probably inside preparing breakfast.\r\nFather stopped a few feet before the visitors, who had gotten slowly to their\r\nfeet.",
    " He cradled his old Pennsylvania rifle, the one with the maplewood stock,\r\nloosely in his arm and said, “Mister Partridge.”\r\n“Good morning, Mister Brown. How d’ ye do? You’ve been off in Tahawus,\r\nyour wife tells us.”\r\n“Yes, we have. You will introduce your companion to me.”\r\n“Been hunting, Mister Brown?” the man said. His teeth were rotted and stained\r\nwith tobacco. “Looks like you come up empty.”\r\n“I do not know you, sir,” Father said. At the sound of his voice, Ruth and Mary\r\nhad come to the window and peered out at us. The boys had stopped their work\r\nand were watching us from a distance. Only the little girls went on as before, as\r\nif there were nothing out of the ordinary happening.\r\n“Billingsly,” the man said. “Abraham Billingsly. Of Albany.”\r\n“I take you to be a bounty-hunter, Mister Billingsly. A slave-catcher.”\r\n“I am an agent. I am an agent hired to return lost or stolen property to its legal\r\nand rightful owner. I have a contract,” he added, patting his breast pocket.\r\n“I do not permit slave-catchers to stand on my land, sir. Nor do I permit those\r\nwho associate with slave-catchers to stand on my land,” Father said to Partridge.\r\n“You will both have to vacate these premises. Immediately.”\r\nThe tall stranger took a step forward and smiled and stopped, as Lyman and I\r\nmoved to either side of Father and let our muskets be seen. In a sleepy drawl,\r\nthe slave-catcher said, “I merely wanted to make some inquiries of you, Mister\r\nBrown. That’s all. Your niggers is safe enough. I already seen the wench inside.\r\nHer and this one with you, neither of them is lost or stolen, leastways not so far\r\nas I know. Matter of fact, your good neighbor here, Mister Partridge, he vouched\r\nfor them himself. I don’t give no trouble to what you call ‘free’ niggers.”\r\n“I’m running you off my property, sir!” Father declared. “Leave now, or we\r\nwill shoot you dead!",
    "”\r\n“No need to get upset!” Partridge said. “This here fellow come by my house\r\nyesterday and requested me to take him over here to North Elba. That’s all! He’s\r\nafter some nigger couple from Virginia that’s killed a man down there and took\r\noff for Canada, pretending they was escaped slaves. They got a arrest warrant\r\nout for them.”\r\n“He has a contract, not a warrant,” Father said.\r\nThe slave-catcher said, “I heard there was escaped slaves passing through here,\r\nMister Brown, and that you might have something to do with handing them\r\nalong. You and your family are well-known, Mister Brown. And I heard there\r\nwas a nigger couple staying in your house. Seemed unusual, so I thought I’d just\r\nhave me a look at them. I see now that they ain’t but field-niggers, though. The\r\nones I’m looking for is a little yellow gal and dark-skinned boy about twenty\r\nyears old. House niggers, Brown. Not flatfoot darkies like yours.”\r\nFather then moved in close to both men, who were considerably taller than he\r\nand younger but who backed off from him, for he bore forward with singular\r\npurpose and barely contained fury. “I do not want to kill you in front of my wife\r\nand children,” Father said. “But by God, I will! Leave here at once!”\r\nPartridge stepped quickly away and made for his horse. The slave-catcher\r\nfollowed behind with as much leisure as he dared show, and the two mounted\r\ntheir horses and backed them off towards the road.\r\n“Aim your muskets, boys,” the Old Man said, and we raised our guns. I looked\r\ndown the barrel at the head of the slave-catcher. It felt wonderfully clarifying.\r\n“We’re leaving, Brown!” Partridge cried, and he put his horse on the road and\r\nkicked it into a gallop and disappeared around the bend.\r\nFor a few seconds, the other man remained and stared hard at Father, as if\r\nmemorizing his face.",
    " “Brown,” he said, “if you try to move the two niggers I’m\r\nlooking for, I’ll have to take them from you.” Then he turned his horse’s head\r\nand rode it slowly from the yard and down the road towards North Elba, passing\r\nwithin twenty feet of the man and woman he wished to capture and return to\r\nslavery.\r\nWe lowered our guns, and the family, including Susan, came and surrounded\r\nus, fearful, but relieved, and also proud of us. My ears were buzzing, and my\r\nheart pounded heavily, and I barely knew where I was or who was with me.\r\nMary was telling Father that the men had arrived the previous evening and had\r\ninterrogated Susan and had poked through all the outbuildings and rooms of the\r\nhouse. Mary had expected them to leave then, which was her reason for allowing\r\nthem to examine the place so thoroughly. She said, “I’d have turned them away\r\nat once, but they insisted on waiting for your return and asked to sleep in the\r\nbarn. We felt like prisoners, but I couldn’t very well refuse them. I’d have sent\r\none of the boys to warn you if we’d known where you were likeliest to come out\r\nof the forest to the road. I’m sure they believed you’d come walking in all\r\nunawares with the very couple they were seeking,” she said.\r\n“And we would have,” said Father. “But for their horses, which I spotted in\r\ntime.”\r\n“That was my doing!” Watson piped. “They had their horses in the barn, so’s\r\nto hide them from you. But when we went out at sunup to put out the stock, we\r\nfirst brought their horses out, as if doing them a kindness, which they couldn’t\r\nvery well object to.”\r\nFather complimented Watson for his cleverness, and then he declared that we\r\nmust give thanks to the Lord. Following his example, we all lowered our heads\r\nthere in the bright, sun-filled yard before the open door of our house, and Father\r\ncommenced to pray with more than his usual fervor.",
    " I felt a noticeable relief\r\nand, momentarily, a genuine uplifting of my spirit from the experience—not so\r\nmuch from Father’s address to the Lord, however, as from standing in the\r\nsunlight in a closed circle with my beloved family and our friends Lyman and\r\nSusan. There were yellow butterflies all around, a cloud of them in the sunlight,\r\nswirling in a spiral, like a beneficent whirlwind.\r\nA few moments later, Watson and I walked back down the road, past the gully\r\nwhere we had hidden Mr. and Mrs. Cannon, to examine the tracks of Partridge\r\nand the slave-catcher Billingsly, so as to be certain they had indeed gone. Then\r\nwe returned and went into the thicket and retrieved the frightened young couple\r\nfrom their hiding place and brought them to the house, where they were fed and\r\nhidden for the day in our attic, and as soon as the morning chores were finished,\r\nFather, Lyman, and I planned on joining them there, to sleep until dark.\r\nThanks to our encounter with Mr. Billingsly and his threats, Father had\r\nchanged his mind and had decided to allow Lyman to accompany us to Port\r\nKent. “I was glad to have him standing with us this morning,” he said to me, as\r\nwe moved through the flock of sheep, separating the first of our pregnant ewes\r\nfrom the others. “At times, I admit, the man seems light-headed, but when it\r\ncounts, he’s firm. I believe he has the courage to shoot a man.”\r\nI asked Father, “What do you think about what Mister Partridge said? About\r\nthe Virginia couple. That they killed a man. He meant their owner, I suppose.”\r\n“Perhaps they did kill the man. Their owner. I certainly hope so,” he said, his\r\nmouth like a crack in a rock. Gently holding one of the pregnant ewes, he\r\nexamined it for disease, poking through the fleece, comforting the animal while\r\nhe expertly parted the fleece with his fingertips. “Billingsly is a bounty-hunter,\r\nnot a marshal.",
    " And as soon as Partridge shows him the way to Timbuctoo, he’ll\r\nbe cut loose, so as not to get any share in the reward. And I don’t think Billingsly\r\nwill dare go up against us alone,” he said. Then he added, “Even so, just in case,\r\nwe’ll be better armed with Lyman along than we would without him.”\r\nWhen I awoke, it was not yet dark, but then, peering out the small attic window,\r\nI saw that Father and Lyman were outside, hitching the team to the wagon. Even\r\nin his fifties, the Old Man had physical energy exceeding mine and that of most\r\nyoung men; he required little more than four or five hours’ sleep for a long day’s\r\nor night’s work, and when he worked, day or night, he seldom stopped to rest.\r\nTo my surprise, Lyman, from his first arrival at our house, seemed naturally to\r\nkeep pace with the Old Man, which I admired and somewhat envied, for it made\r\nme feel lazy by contrast and ashamed, although neither of them was thoughtless\r\nenough to comment on my need for a normal portion of sleep or to upbraid me\r\nfor slothfulness, except as a light, affectionate tease.\r\nI hurried down the ladder to the kitchen, where our cargo, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCannon, freshly washed and for the first time looking unfrightened, were seated\r\nat the table with Mary, Ruth, Susan, and several of the children, cheerfully at\r\nplay with a string game apparently taught them by Mrs. Cannon. I cut myself a\r\nlarge slice of bread and ate and silently watched, until Father came inside and\r\ngave us the order to depart. We escorted Mr. and Mrs. Cannon outside and\r\nplaced them and their bundles and a basket of food for our journey into the back\r\nof the wagon, where the couple arranged themselves atop the several fleeces and\r\ntanned deerhides and pelts that Father had packed there. These he planned to\r\nsell in Port Kent, our ostensible reason for traveling to the town.",
    " Then, rifle in\r\nhand, Lyman climbed into the box, and Father covered the box and all its\r\ncontents with a canvas sheet, which he drew tight and tied with the children’s\r\ncord. I climbed up and took the reins. Father, holding both our rifles, joined me\r\nthere, and with a somber wave goodbye to the family gathered by the doorway,\r\nwe departed.\r\nWe saw no one along the road to North Elba until we reached the Thompson\r\nfarm, where Mr. Thompson and several of his sons were crossing the road with\r\ntheir cows, bringing them into the barn for milking, and we were forced to stop.\r\nMr. Thompson hailed us and walked over, while his boys moved the cattle. Of all\r\nthe white people in the region, he was probably our closest friend and associate.\r\nA fervent anti-slavery man, father of a brood of sons more numerous than our\r\nown, and a skilled farmer and carpenter, he was the only local man towards\r\nwhom Father’s admiration went without serious provisos attached. He was tall\r\nand bulky, built like a cider barrel, and, although red-faced and high-spirited,\r\nwas deeply religious and, like Father, a temperance man. I liked him for his\r\nhumorous ways and the ease with which he commanded his phalanx of sons,\r\nwhose ages corresponded fairly closely to ours. Although the eldest, Henry, was\r\nnearly my age, there were still babies being born annually in the Thompson\r\nhouse, one male child after another, numbering now sixteen. Mr. Thompson’s\r\nwife, the woman who had produced this brood, was large and cheerful, not\r\nunlike her husband, and it was perhaps only in hopes of at last bearing a\r\ndaughter that she continued to allow herself to become pregnant, for she was\r\nnearing middle-age and the natural end of her child-bearing years.\r\nFather raised his hand in greeting and touched the rim of his right ear, the\r\ncommon signal for conductors. Mr.",
    " Thompson gave the countersign and touched\r\nhis ear also. “I saw that fellow Partridge from Keene this morning,” he said to us.\r\n“Yes,” Father answered. “He and his friend, a man named Billingsly, they paid\r\nus a visit as well.”\r\nMr. Thompson took a long look at the wagon box. “Do you need help?”\r\n“No.”\r\n“Partridge and the bounty-hunter went on to the Negro settlement. You know,\r\nJohn, there’s plenty of folks hereabouts, folks like Partridge, who’d happily give\r\naid and comfort to a slave-catcher for the beauty of a dollar or two.”\r\n“Where might he light?” Father asked.\r\n“Anybody local would tell the man to wait out to Wilmington Notch. So if I\r\nwas you, I’d keep moving and moving fast when I got to the notch. It’ll be dark\r\nby then.”\r\n“Thank you kindly,” Father said.\r\nMr. Thompson nodded and stepped aside. His cows had crossed the road and\r\nwere making their slow way towards his barn. The sun had nearly set over the\r\nwooded hills west of Whiteface, and wide plum-colored streaks were spreading\r\nacross the pale yellow sky. I snapped the reins, and we moved on towards the\r\nroad that led out of North Elba and passed along the West Branch of the Au\r\nSable, across the flat, marshy grasslands to where the river turned northeast.\r\nSoon it was dark, with the nearly full moon flashing intermittently on our right\r\nbehind the black silhouettes of the trees. Whiteface towered on our left, its long,\r\npale scars brightly illuminated by the moonlight, and below us the glittering\r\nriver, making a great noise, narrowed and passed over rocks and cascades as the\r\nmountains on either side converged at the notch. For several miles here the road\r\nwas barely wide enough for a single wagon. On one side the land fell off\r\nprecipitously to the river, while on the other a sheer rock face where not even\r\nshrubs grew rose towards high ledges and outcroppings that nearly blocked the\r\nsky.",
    "\r\nWe had just entered the notch, when Father ordered me to halt the wagon, and\r\nafter I had done it, he got down and loosened the tarpaulin at the back and\r\nfolded it over so that Lyman could see out. In a low voice, he said to Lyman, “If\r\nsomeone gives chase, Mister Epps, just fire away.” Then he climbed back up\r\nbeside me, and we continued as before.\r\nThe darkened road turned and twisted, and I was obliged to hold the team to a\r\nwalking pace. The track was narrow and sometimes sloped abruptly down to the\r\nedge of the water, then ascended a ways to cross above an overhanging cliff,\r\nuntil, forced by a wall of huge boulders from an ancient landslide, it switch-\r\nbacked towards the river and descended to the rushing waters again. Day or\r\nnight, this was a mighty dangerous place. Highwayman, slave-catcher, bounty-\r\nhunter—one man alone could stop a wagon from passing here and could keep it\r\nfrom turning back as well, simply by felling a tree or rolling a boulder down\r\nfrom the embankment above. At every turning I was sure we would suddenly be\r\nbrought up short by an obstacle in the road and would be fired upon from the\r\ndarkness. Father kept his rifle at the ready and said nothing. The sounds of the\r\nhorses’ hooves were muffled by the roar of the water below, and I felt as if we\r\nwere passing through a long, dark cave, when gradually I saw that we had\r\nemerged from the notch, for the road had straightened somewhat and the hills\r\nseemed to have parted and backed away. The light of the moon splashed across\r\nthe tan backs of the horses; the noise of the river had diminished, and I could\r\nhear the comforting clop of the horses’ hooves again. It was then that I heard the\r\nrapid pounding of my heart, for I had grown considerably more alarmed by our\r\npassage through the notch, now that we were safely beyond, than when we were\r\nactually doing it.",
    " For a long time no one spoke, but after a while, when we were\r\nwell clear of the notch and passing through the relatively flat valley of the Au\r\nSable where it’s joined by the East Branch coming north from Keene, Father said,\r\n“I didn’t think Billingsly would want to go up against us alone. But the truth is,\r\nhe could have done us some damage back there.”\r\nWe were safe now, on the high, more or less straight, northeasterly road to the\r\nvillage of Keesville and on to Port Kent. This was the other of the two roads into\r\nthe Adirondack wilderness from Lake Champlain. The first was the toll road that\r\nwe’d taken on our arrival from Westport, through Elizabethtown and Keene and\r\nthe pass at Edmonds Lakes near our farm. This more northerly route, the old\r\nMilitary Road dating back to the days of the French and Indian wars, once you\r\ngot through the Wilmington Notch, was wide enough in places for two wagons\r\nto pass and took you across the rolling hills and fertile farmlands alongside the\r\nnow meandering Au Sable and Boquet Rivers directly to the shore of the vast\r\nlake. Our journey from here on was uneventful and sped by, as we passed\r\ndarkened farms and settlements, sighting an occasional herd of deer grazing at\r\nthe edge of a meadow or a fox darting into the brush beside the road, while the\r\nmoon slowly ascended from behind us to its high point overhead and then began\r\nits descent towards the lake.\r\nAfter crossing the swaying bridge over the falls at Keesville, we began to get\r\nglimpses of the lake now and then through the trees, until finally we came to the\r\nhigh, grassy head of land that forms the protective cove where Port Kent is\r\nlocated, and it was as if we had come to the edge of the sea.",
    " Father bade me to\r\nstop the wagon, and he got down and helped Lyman and our fugitives climb out\r\nof the wagon and stretch their limbs and enjoy the cool, fresh air off the lake.\r\nFor a few moments, we stood about and rested and ate a portion of the food that\r\nMary had packed for us. We did not speak much one to the other, but instead\r\nsimply gazed at the beauty of the land and sky and water that lay before us.\r\nThe moon had streaked the dark waters with skeins of molten silver. Way in\r\nthe east at the horizon, the velvety night sky was lit by the pale light of a false\r\ndawn, and from our place on the height of land overlooking the broad expanse\r\nof the lake, morning seemed imminent. The lake, one hundred four miles long\r\nfrom north to south, was at its widest here, more than twenty miles across to the\r\nstate of Vermont. A cool breeze blew sharply over the choppy waters to land,\r\nand on the far side of the lake a starry sky hovered above the Vermont horizon\r\nlike a deep blue curtain lit from below.\r\nWhen it was time to move on, Lyman Epps and Mr. and Mrs. Cannon of\r\nRichmond, Virginia, climbed back into the wagon, and Father once again tied\r\ndown the tarpaulin and came and joined me up front. We followed the road\r\ndown from the headland to the shore and soon entered the village of Port Kent.\r\nWe were headed for the boatyard owned and operated by the Quaker Solomon\r\nKeifer, whom we expected to show up at dawn to commence his day’s work\r\nthere. The village was still mostly asleep, although here and there we saw a\r\nwindow lit by candles or an oil lamp inside. We passed the main dock and\r\nseveral stone warehouses, after which came a row of small boathouses, until we\r\narrived at the last in the row, where we saw a small sign, Capt. S. I. Keifer, above\r\nthe closed door facing the lane.",
    " Here I drew the wagon to a halt and jumped\r\ndown and tied the horses to a hitching post. A narrow pier ran out a ways into\r\nthe lake, where a wide-bottomed schooner was tied up—the last leg of our\r\nfugitives’ journey, their final means of transport to freedom.\r\nA narrow wooden stairway led up from the shore to a crest of land above,\r\nwhere there were a number of houses and a church and meeting house, and\r\nFather immediately went that way, in search of Captain Keifer, while Lyman and\r\nI stayed with the wagon and our cargo. Feeling we were finally safe, I put my\r\nrifle down and untied the tarpaulin, and when I had done so, Lyman came and\r\nstood with me in the darkness, stretching his legs and rubbing his aching joints,\r\nwhich signs of discomfort caused me to beckon to Mr. and Mrs. Cannon to come\r\nout of the wagon. Slowly, first the man and then the woman emerged from the\r\nbox and brought their bundles with them and regarded the unlikely scene with\r\ncuriosity and some natural trepidation, for it must have looked to them that they\r\nwere about to set off on an ocean-going voyage.\r\nLyman laid his rifle in the box of the wagon and stepped behind the boathouse\r\na ways to relieve himself, and I began to explain to our fugitives that we were\r\nlocated on the shore of a lake barely forty miles south of Canada. This was the\r\nlast stop on the Underground Railroad, I was saying, when I heard a man’s voice\r\nfrom the darkness behind me.\r\n“Just stand where you are, Brown, and put your hands on your head,” he said\r\ncalmly, and when I turned, I saw him with his revolver on Lyman. It was Mr.\r\nBillingsly, the slave-catcher. I slowly lifted my hands and placed them on my\r\nhead as instructed and as Lyman had already done.\r\n“You niggers, you move over here by me,” the slave-catcher said to Mr. and\r\nMrs. Cannon. “And you,” he said to Lyman, “you stand by the wagon there with\r\nBrown.",
    "” I saw then that the man was carrying in his other hand a pair of\r\nmanacles. Extending them to me, he said, “Clamp these onto my prisoners,\r\nBrown.”\r\n“No,” I said. “I will not do that.”\r\nHe stared at me hard. “You people are crazy, is what.”\r\nHe turned to Lyman. “Here. You do it, then. Put these irons on them.” He held\r\nthe instruments out to him.\r\nLyman regarded the manacles coldly. He said, “You the slave-catcher, not me.”\r\nAt that instant, I saw Father step out of the darkness behind Billingsly. He held\r\nhis musket at waist level with both hands and had it aimed straight at the small\r\nof the man’s back. “Put down your gun, Mister Billingsly,” he said in a cold,\r\nalmost expressionless voice.\r\nThe slave-catcher’s eyes went dead, and he inhaled deeply and did as he was\r\ntold.\r\n“Lie on the ground, face-down” Father said. Behind Father stood a man whom\r\nI took to be Captain Keifer, a short, black-haired fellow with a fringe of beard on\r\nhis chin. There was a note in Father’s voice that frightened me, and it surely\r\nmust have terrified Billingsly, if he had any sense at all: it was the note of a man\r\nwhose mind was made up, who would not be stopped from completing the\r\nterrible action that he had already decided upon, no matter how the\r\ncircumstances changed. I knew that he had decided to kill the man. And in spite\r\nof being frightened by the tone in Father’s voice, I was excited by it.\r\nMr. Billingsly got down on his knees and then lay on his stomach, his face\r\npressed against the rocky ground, and when he had done so, Father stepped\r\nforward and, straddling the maris body, aimed his gun down at his head.\r\nLyman said, “You ain’t goin’ to kill the man, Mister Brown.”\r\n“I am,” Father said.\r\nCaptain Keifer moved forward then and said to Father, “I pray thee, Brown, do\r\nnot kill him. It is not for thee to execute the man.",
    "”\r\nLyman looked at me with disbelief, and I caught a glimpse of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCannon as they backed away from the scene to the front of the wagon and stood\r\nby the horses, as if preparing for flight.\r\nShoving the stock against his shoulder, Father looked coldly down the barrel at\r\nthe man’s head. I could see that Billingsly’s teeth were clenched and his eyes\r\nwere closed tightly, as if he expected nothing less than to hear the irritating\r\nexplosion of gunfire. It was very strange—he did not look like a man who\r\nbelieved he would die of it. He did not seem to believe that he was inside his\r\nown body and that his brain was about to be blown to bits.\r\n“Slave-catcher” Father said, “I am sending thee straight to hell.”\r\nI did not dare to rush Father and try to seize his weapon—the gun might go off\r\nand kill the slave-catcher beneath it, or our struggle with one another might give\r\nthe man the opportunity to escape, and I did not want that, either—so I stood as\r\nif rooted to the ground. But when Captain Keifer stepped firmly forward with his\r\nhands extended as if to grab Father from behind, I spoke out at last. “Wait,\r\nFather!” I cried. “Back off, and put the man in his own manacles! Let him wear\r\nthe manacles he planned to use on the Negroes. And let Lyman do it!” I said.\r\nSlowly, Father lowered his rifle and backed away from the slave-catcher. “Put\r\nyour hands behind your back,” he ordered, and the slave-catcher obeyed. “All\r\nright, Lyman. Place the chains on him, and lock them tight.”\r\nLyman reached down and grabbed up one of the two sets of manacles and\r\nclamped them onto the white man.\r\nFather rolled Billingsly over onto his back, groped through the man’s waistcoat\r\npockets until he found the keys, and tossed the keys far out into the cove.",
    " He\r\ngrabbed the second pair of manacles and heaved them into the darkness also,\r\nand when they fell into the water, there was a loud splash, and then silence.\r\nA moment passed, and Father said, “Put him into the wagon, Owen.” Lyman\r\nand I retrieved our guns and together hefted the slave-catcher onto his feet and\r\nshoved him into the box of the wagon. While Lyman stood guard over him, I\r\nquickly set about removing the hides and pelts, which Captain Keifer would be\r\nselling for us, and placed them inside the boathouse. Father escorted our poor,\r\nforlorn, very frightened fugitives directly to the boat, and the captain prepared\r\nto set sail at once, for the sun would soon rise and there would be many people\r\ncoming and going along the shore here.\r\n“Cast off!” the captain called to Father, who promptly untied the lines from\r\nthe pilings and tossed them onto the deck. The captain loosed and unfurled a\r\nsmall triangle of sail at the bow, which caught the breeze at once, and the\r\nschooner moved abruptly away from the dock. The captain was standing at the\r\nwheel in the bow, and the couple from Virginia were up on the foredeck,\r\nstanding together and watching, not us, but the dark northern sky, where there\r\nwas a star, clear and bold, a diamond. Over in the east, the sky had turned a pale\r\nblond color, with the tops of the mountains beyond the lake just visible at the\r\nhorizon. The captain scrambled forward and let out more sail, then returned to\r\nthe wheel, and in a few moments the boat had crossed the cove and was\r\nrounding the point at the far end, heading for open water.\r\nWe left Port Kent at once, carrying the slave-catcher out of town to the point on\r\nthe headlands above the lake where we had rested earlier, and here Father bade\r\nme to pull up. He and I climbed down from the wagon and came around to the\r\nrear, where Lyman and I got the fellow out.",
    "\r\nWhen we climbed into the wagon again, with Lyman stretched out in the back\r\nand Father and I seated up front, and prepared to leave him, the slave-catcher\r\nshot us a puzzled expression—it was the look of a man who did not understand\r\nwhy we had not killed him. Not because he thought we were murderers, but\r\nbecause the logic of the situation had demanded it. It seemed to make no sense\r\nto him that he was still alive, and he stared after us with an almost plaintive\r\nexpression, as if he wanted us to come back and properly execute him.\r\nFather said to me, “Drive on quickly, Owen. I cannot stand the sight of the\r\nman.” I slapped the reins, and we left him there, standing in the moonlight in\r\nthe middle of the track, his hands clamped behind him in irons.\r\nWe said nothing to one another for a long while, and then, finally, a few miles\r\nwest of Keesville, Father sighed heavily and said, “I am grateful to thee, Owen.”\r\n“You are? For what?”\r\n“For interfering with me. Back there at the lake.”\r\n“I feared you would be angry with me.”\r\n“No, son. I’m in no way angry. I’m grateful to you. I am. In saving Billingsly’s\r\nlife, you probably saved my soul from hell. Fact is, I’m not ready to kill a man,\r\nOwen.”\r\n“Not in cold blood,” I said.\r\n“Yes, and that’s the problem. My killing him would have been murder, pure\r\nand simple. I have no cold blood, Owen. Not a drop. I must acquire it.”\r\nI did not know what to say to that; I could not begin to grasp his meaning\r\nthen; so I said nothing and, for the remainder of our journey, drove mostly in\r\nsilence.",
    " There would come a time, however, and not many years later—in the\r\nsmoke and blood of Kansas, with the bodies of men and boys yanked from their\r\nwarm winter beds and hacked to death with machetes and lying now in chunks\r\nsteaming like fresh meat all around us in the frozen grass—when I would\r\nremember this small conversation, and I would understand it then, just as I am\r\nsure you do now.\r\nChapter 8\r\nOur involvement with the Underground Railroad aside, our concern for the\r\nwelfare of the Negroes of Timbuctoo, and our private virtues, along with the\r\nways in which those virtues organized our behavior—all that aside, Miss Mayo,\r\nwe were to every casual appearance very much like our North Elba neighbors.\r\nCountry people. A stranger passing through the broad valley that lay between\r\nWhiteface and Tahawus would have had little reason to remark upon us (unless,\r\nlike Mr. Dana and his party of lost hikers, he sat at table with us and stayed the\r\nnight). He would likely merely have thought that we Browns were nothing\r\nunusual for our time and place. Except, perhaps, for our way of speaking, which\r\na stranger would perceive at once and which was, I believe, regarded by some as\r\ndownright peculiar. And here, in the matter of the manner of our speaking, we\r\nget to a thing that was both striking and readily apparent to all who met us,\r\neven for a moment, a thing that, to my knowledge, has never been described\r\nbefore, certainly not in print.\r\nIt is perhaps inevitable that the speech mannerisms of a family will be\r\nsignificantly influenced by the single strongest member of that family, and so it\r\nwas with us. Thus, to a one, even to the littlest child, we sounded very like\r\nFather.",
    " Elaborately plainspoken, you might say—a manner or style of speech\r\nthat originated, so far as I know, with Grandfather Owen Brown, who, having\r\nhad a profound effect on Father’s way of speaking, is indirectly an influence on\r\nmy way, too, even here and now, and on that of the rest of the family as well. So\r\nlet me speak first of him.\r\nGrandfather, who was born and raised in Connecticut back before the\r\nRevolution, chose and spoke his words in that old, now-forgotten, New England\r\nPuritan manner—deliberately, carefully, with a few thees and thous for\r\nleavening, almost as if he were writing his words down on paper, instead of\r\nspeaking them aloud. He went beyond even the old New Englanders, however,\r\nfor Grandfather was a stammerer and as a child had trained himself to speak\r\nwith a formal, dry precision, slowly and in complete sentences, so as not to be\r\ncontrolled or confounded by his affliction. The man cultivated silences and used\r\nthem as exclamations. He seemed to rehearse his statements in his mind before\r\nmaking any utterance, which gave to him a stately manner overall and provided\r\nothers with the impression that he was an unusually reflective manas, indeed, he\r\nwas. By thinking his words first, by silently phrasing and parsing them in his\r\nmind, and only afterwards, when he was satisfied with their lightness, speaking\r\nthem aloud, Grandfather cultivated his thought more thoroughly than ordinary\r\nfolk, and as a result his words not only seemed, by virtue of the way they were\r\npresented, to be wise; they in fact, more often than not, were wise. “You think as\r\nyou speak, not vice versa” Father often said, and a man forced by an affliction\r\nsuch as stammering to control his speech will in turn soon learn to control his\r\nthoughts. So it was with Grandfather.",
    "\r\nFather, with no such handicap as stammering to straiten his way, was obliged\r\nto impose one upon himself. When he was a young man, he curbed his reckless\r\nspeech, and hence his thoughts, by placing into his mouth a stone that was\r\nsufficiently large to forbid easy and casual talk, and he carried the stone all day\r\nlong in silence, except when he deliberately plucked it out and unplugged his\r\nmouth, as it were. He used the trick of Demosthenes, but in reverse, and not to\r\novercome a handicap, but to simulate one, so as to obtain its compensatory\r\nadvantages, which he had observed and admired in his own father.\r\n“The inner man and the outer are one, unless ye be a hypocrite and\r\ndissembler. Control one of the two, and soon ye will control both,” the Old Man\r\noften said, applying his prescription as much to himself as to us children, whom\r\nhe was instructing. All his instructions, admonitions, and rules were as much for\r\nhim to follow, honor, and obey as for us. Never did I feel that Father had not\r\nhimself contended with passions or desires fully as strong as my own, or that he\r\nhad not, on numerous occasions, felt himself as weak, afraid, lonely, despondent,\r\nor frustrated as I and my brothers were, and my sisters, too. Quite the opposite.\r\nAnd from our point of view, all the more virtue accrued to him for his not\r\nhaving given himself over to those feelings. Thus his authority over us resided to\r\na considerable degree in our awareness of his, and not our, struggle with vice,\r\nand his, not our, triumph over it.\r\nSimilarly, whatever self-imposed deprivation, whatever forms of abstinence, he\r\nrequested of us, he demanded of himself also, despite what he confessed were\r\nhis larger-than-normal desires to indulge in them. We none of us drank tea or\r\ncoffee. We used no tobacco. We drank no whiskey, brandy, beer, or fermented\r\ncider, and kept none in the house.",
    " A visitor or houseguest unable to endure a\r\nmeal without these stimulants and intoxicants would have to provide his own\r\nand then would find himself in the uncomfortable position of being observed by\r\nall the children and even those of us who were adults with curiosity and slight\r\ncondescension, as if he were a Chinaman sucking on an opium pipe. If one of us\r\nsecretly indulged in the use of tobacco, tea, or coffee, or accepted a sip of\r\nwhiskey from a friend or an acquaintance, as each of us, especially we boys, did\r\nfrom time to time, his physical and mental reactions to it were all out of\r\nproportion to his expectations, and he backed off quickly and in fear. The high\r\ndegree of excitation provided by these stimulants and intoxicants, due perhaps to\r\nour lack of experience with their use and to our shame, was almost always\r\nsufficient to keep us from returning for a second try. In addition, there was the\r\nthreat of exile, of feeling cast out from the family, to keep us from disobeying\r\nFather’s rules of abstinence. No one of us wanted to be the only one unable to\r\nkeep his rules. Whether the rest of the family knew of it hardly mattered: we\r\nknew of it, and that was enough to guarantee an intolerable loneliness. An\r\noccasional taste of that loneliness, like the single sip of whiskey or puff of\r\ntobacco smoke, was all any of us needed to renew his commitment to purity,\r\nabstinence, self-discipline, and to the orderly comportment of his mind,\r\nlanguage, and private acts.\r\nWith regard to sexual matters, we all, except possibly poor Fred, were normal\r\nenough boys and then young men. Little as I know of what is normal for girls\r\nand women in such matters, I assume the same was true for the females in the\r\nfamily.",
    " And in this as in all things, Father’s advice bore the weight of a\r\nproscription and sometimes even that of a command: he advised us boys, offered\r\nas if in passing, with no room for discussion or further inquiry, to keep ourselves\r\npure and to marry young and to study St. Paul’s letters.\r\nForgive me for speaking of the subject—I wish above all to be as frank as I\r\nhave been truthful—but did Father believe that I, at least, was unable to forbear\r\nfrom self-abuse? It’s a question that has long worried me. I suspect he thought I\r\nwas, just as I was sure that my brothers, both older and younger, must\r\noccasionally have abandoned themselves to this vice, although none of us ever\r\nconfessed it. All of us—except Fred, whose sensitivity to sin and whose measure\r\nof guilt was so much greater than ours—possessed large animal spirits. John and\r\nJason married young; Fred did not marry. Nor did I. Ruth and Annie married\r\nyoung, as did Watson and Oliver, who, along with Fred, died young. But I lived\r\non for many long years, struggling even into old age to maintain my purity as\r\ndiligently and with the same meager degree of success and heaped-up\r\nunhappiness over failure as when I was a boy. In later years, naturally, my\r\nanimal spirits diminished to a great degree, and my struggle to control them\r\nabated at last. But without the struggle, there was no virtue; I take no particular\r\npride, therefore, in the relative purity of my old age.\r\nAll our virtues—of piety, honesty, abstinence, and so on, of cleanliness and\r\norderliness, of devotion to work and industry, of love of learning and of\r\nneighborliness—were the products and expressions of struggle. This was not\r\nmuch understood by those who observed us and later wrote about our life and\r\ncharacter.",
    " Remember, Father, first and perhaps foremost among us, and every\r\nother member of the family as well, even including the women, pious Mary,\r\nsweet Ruth, and my younger sisters, Annie and Sarah—all of us were normal\r\npeople. Which is to say, there was not a one of us who was not tempted by\r\nimpiety. And we were intelligently skeptical about so much—Father, after all,\r\nencouraged it in us practically from infancy—that it was difficult not to apply\r\nthat same skepticism to our entire way of life. Many was the time when we\r\nwanted to give ourselves over to another way. What was this crackbrained\r\nobsession with slavery and Negroes anyhow? one might well ask, and sometimes\r\nwe did ask it as, exhausted and exasperated by another of Father’s plans to move\r\nus to a new place or to start a school for Negro children or to drop everything\r\nand ride off in search of escaped slaves who, without us, would have made their\r\nown way to Canada safely just the same, we would look at one another and roll\r\nour eyes upward and trudge out to the barn in the dark of night and harness up\r\nthe horses yet again.\r\nAt bottom, then, we were ordinary people and were tempted, not just by\r\nimpiety, but by typical American dishonesty as well—and not so much to lie or\r\ncheat or steal, but simply to push an advantage on occasion, to charge for a\r\nservice or good whatever the buyer was willing to pay, for instance, instead of\r\ncharging only what was fair. That is, instead of asking no more than the cost of\r\nthat same service or good to us. Which was Father’s monetary policy’s ethical\r\nbase. We were all obliged to stand upon it firmly, yet here we were, always in\r\ndeep debt, scrambling for ways to avoid foreclosure, bankruptcy, imprisonment.",
    "\r\nHonesty in these matters, especially considering our dire circumstances, was thus\r\nalways the result of struggle, and was all the more virtuous therefore—even as\r\nour financial circumstances worsened, and Father tumbled towards out-and-out\r\nbankruptcy, and all around us others prospered.\r\nLikewise, our abstinence was achieved only through struggle against constant\r\ntemptation, for we did not remove ourselves, as Shakers and Mennonites do,\r\nfrom ordinary, daily contact with people who rationalized the indulgence of\r\nevery sensual appetite. On the contrary, we befriended and moved freely\r\namongst them all—drunkards, boisterers, brawlers, and sensualists of every\r\nstripe and type. They were everywhere in those days, especially out at the edges\r\nof civilized society, which is, after all, where we most often resided ourselves,\r\nand many of them were our strongest allies in the work. We associated with such\r\nfolks as much on principle as convenience and as a consequence of our natural\r\nsociability. We thought it necessary and right and believed that it helped in the\r\nwork, for there were many radical abolitionists whose genteel fastidiousness\r\nrendered them wholly ineffective, and Father enjoyed pointing them out to us.\r\n“Boston ladies,” he called them, although most of them were men.\r\nNo, we Browns maintained our virtue in the face of daily temptation, willfully,\r\nelaborately contriving it, as if the virtue were not worth much without it. And\r\nthough it may have sometimes encouraged in us a feeling of superiority to other\r\n“normal” people, that, too, was a temptation to be met, struggled with, and\r\novercome, in public and in private, just as I am doing here, even now. Just as\r\nFather himself did throughout his life.",
    "\r\nAlways, Father taught by example and instruction: the two were deliberately\r\ninterwoven; he made of our childhood understandings a fabric that could not be\r\nunraveled or torn. For instance, with regard to our well-known love of learning,\r\nhad we not watched since earliest childhood the Old Man every evening turn to\r\nhis bookcase and draw out from it a treasured, much-thumbed tome and\r\ncommence to read from it and comment on what he read there, we would not\r\nhave believed, due to our lack of formal education, that there was anything of\r\ngreat value to be obtained from books, especially such books as Father, no\r\nmatter how unsettled or hectic the circumstances, loved and studied all his life.\r\nLike most of our neighbors and friends, we would normally have thought that\r\nbooks of philosophy and history and natural science were better left to the\r\nlearned and were not proper fields of study for such rough country types as we.\r\nFather’s sustained example, however, led us to the experience itself. And by\r\nimitating his hard-earned love of learning, we were gradually filled with a love\r\nof learning ourselves, and thus we came to possess it as if it were a gift to be\r\ntreasured for life and not a dour, burdensome consequence of blind obedience,\r\ncast off as soon as darkness fell.\r\nWe all saw our father, Mary saw her husband, struggle with temptation—he\r\nmade us see it, he spoke of it constantly: his sensuality, his slothfulness, his vain\r\ndesire for wealth and fame, his pridefulness—and we saw him daily overcome\r\neach and every one of those temptations. How could we not go forward, then,\r\nand do likewise? We who were no more and no less sensual, slothful, vain, and\r\nproud than he? It was his weakness as much as his strength that guided and\r\ninstructed us; his pitiful, simple, common humanity that inspired us.",
    " Those who\r\nlater wrote that Father was like an infallible god to us were wrong.\r\nWe were much misunderstood always. That, I suppose, is yet another of the\r\nmany ways in which we Browns paid for our virtues. Poverty is one, too. We\r\nwere hard-working, a large and highly skilled family of workers, and yet,\r\nbecause of our devotion to our Negro neighbors and their cause, all our\r\nenterprises failed. Father was regarded by some, rightly, as a genius when it\r\ncame to livestock. And he was a self-taught surveyor of great skill and\r\nunderstood all the ways in which a piece of land was valuable or poor. He was a\r\ntanner capable at the age of twenty of organizing and operating a large tannery\r\non his own. He was a businessman who understood the subtle connections\r\nbetween the producer of wool, the wholesale purveyor of wool, the manipulation\r\nby the purveyor of the market price for wool, and the consequent exploitation of\r\nthe producer, and he was able to conceive and put into place a complex scheme\r\nto block that exploitation. And yet we ourselves remained poor, in permanent\r\ndebt, living on the kindness and philanthropy of men like Mr. Gerrit Smith and\r\nMr. Simon Perkins. For while in many ways we may well have been self-\r\nsufficient, growing all our own food and manufacturing all our clothing and\r\ntools, we were obliged to do it on land that, in the end, belonged to others.\r\nEven in North Elba, where Mr. Smith had deeded Father two hundred forty\r\nacres of first-rate tableland at one dollar per acre. Father died owing for most of\r\nit. The Old Man raised money, many thousands of dollars, for the Negroes from\r\nwhite strangers all over the United States, but when he died, his widow had not\r\na dollar to her name. I remember hunger; I remember cold; I remember public\r\nhumiliation—these were the hard prices we paid for our much-admired devotion\r\nto principle.",
    " And I did not think it would ever end, despite Father’s schemes and\r\nhis permanent willingness to launch every year a new enterprise for raising\r\nmoney: gathering wool all over Ohio and Pennsylvania and warehousing it for\r\nMr. Perkins in Springfield until the prices rose; buying and selling purebred\r\ncattle; speculating on land where canals were rumored to be going in any day\r\nnow; and on and on, his face bright with the vision of all his debts at last being\r\npaid off, of finally owning his own farm outright, of being able to provide for his\r\nlarge, ever-growing family against the rigors that he believed would characterize\r\nthe long years ahead. For he was sure that Mary would survive him—she was so\r\nmuch younger than he—and believed that she would be left with young children\r\nto care for. He did not want to die without having provided for his widow and\r\nchildren.\r\nTo all appearances, though, and compared with our neighbors, especially our\r\nNegro neighbors in North Elba, we did prosper. Our farm was a thriving\r\noperation. This was mainly due to hard work and Father’s great organizational\r\nskills. Although I was, in a sense, the foreman, Father was the executive and\r\nevery day laid out the tasks that we each would attend to. Much of farm life, of\r\ncourse, is a round, and the work is organized merely by the turning of the year\r\nand by the slow, regular rhythms of animal life, and it needs no executive, but\r\nwe were a large family with diverse skills and abilities, children at different\r\nstages of growth, from the youngest, who was then Sarah, to the eldest in\r\nresidence, me, a full-grown adult. And there were the other adults as well-Mary,\r\nour mother and stepmother, and sister Ruth, and Lyman and Susan Epps, who\r\nhad come to seem like permanent members of the household, like in-laws.",
    "\r\nWe were close, interlocked, like the gears and wheels, cogs and belts, of an\r\nelaborate machine. Whatever one of us thought, said, or did had an immediate,\r\nfelt effect on everyone else. It may be that our family in its closeness was\r\nsometimes thought by us to be suffocating and too much controlling of our daily\r\nlives, and it must have seemed that way often to outsiders; but we were never\r\nlonely, never without a sense of being useful and even necessary to the rest, and\r\nnever without support and encouragement, even in our moments of greatest\r\ndespair. For we each took strength, not from Father alone, but from the family as\r\na whole. Father, of course, was the family’s mainstay; he provided us with\r\nexample, instruction, understanding, and strength. As a result, when he himself\r\nweakened or fell into despair, it was very difficult for the rest of us not to do\r\nlikewise. And whenever Father’s belief in the rightness and necessity of his path\r\nwavered, as from time to time it did, or when his faith in his God was\r\nthreatened, as happened at least twice that I know of, his forward motion would\r\ninstantly stop. And when he stopped, the rest of us would slow and wobble on\r\nour respective pivots and would soon find ourselves stopped and lying on our\r\nsides as well.\r\nIn the terrible winter of ’43,1 remember, when the four children died—the\r\nfirst Sarah, Charles, Peter, and the baby, Austin—Father fell into such a\r\nprolonged numbness that, before he recovered his feelings, we ourselves had\r\ndescended into deepest despond, and he was obliged to nurse us, every one, back\r\nto health again.",
    " It was as if the sickness that took the children one after the\r\nother that bleak winter first invaded his spirit and from him spread like a\r\npestilence to Mary and thence to John and Jason and me and on to Ruth and the\r\nyounger children, even to poor Salmon, who was only a small boy at the time,\r\nseven years old, the youngest child not to be taken from us. It was an\r\nunsupportable burden. The fires dwindled and flickered out, and the ashes grew\r\ncold, and we walked about the house with our arms wrapped around ourselves\r\nand silently cursed the day of our birth. No one of us could rouse the other from\r\nhis despair.\r\nFather took to his Bible, and for the first time he did not read aloud or instruct\r\nus from it. He sat on a stool in the corner, muttering the words to himself, as if\r\nseeking, but not finding there, some explanation of why God had done this to us.\r\nPoverty he could endure with good spirits, and every setback and\r\ndisappointment he regarded as temporary. And he had lost a child before, the\r\nfirst Frederick, who had died at the age of five and for whom he had grieved,\r\nand after a normal period of mourning he had resumed his life—he even named\r\nhis next male child Frederick, as I have already described. But this disaster, this\r\nterrible loss, was beyond all his worst expectations, beyond all his\r\nunderstanding. His faith was sorely tested by it—that fact alone humiliated him\r\nand beat him down. To have four of his beloved children taken from him, each\r\nof them in its pitiful turn dying in his arms, this defeated him utterly. There was\r\nno one amongst us who could console or uplift him, for all of us, even Mary, had\r\ngrown so accustomed to relying on him for consolation and uplift that if he was\r\nemptied of force, then we were, too.\r\nThis was the other, the darker side of our family’s strength. When the Old Man\r\nwent down, we all went down.",
    " Happily, almost nothing ever discouraged or\r\ndefeated Father, except the death of children, which, by the time of his own\r\ndeath, he had endured so many times that his heart must have been nearly\r\ncovered over with a skein of thick gray scars.\r\nKnowing his terrible, long suffering, one can forgive him anything, I suppose. It\r\nrarely happened, he was so strong and so right, but there were times, certainly,\r\nwhen I felt called to forgive Father. Not by him—he seldom asked for my\r\nforgiveness, and when he did ask, it was for some trivial transgression, some\r\nslight oversight—but called upon by myself alone. In order to save me from him.\r\nForgive the Old Man, I would say to myself. Come on, now, grow large, Owen,\r\nand be generous with understanding and compassion. Yes, understanding,\r\nespecially that—for when one understands a human being, no matter how\r\noppressive he has been, compassion inevitably follows. Yet there was so much\r\nthat I could not understand about this man, my father, and the life we led\r\nbecause of him—my thoughts, my questions, were blocked, occluded: by the\r\nabsolute tightness of his cause, which none of us could question, ever; and by\r\nthe sheer power of Father’s personality, the relentlessness of it, how it wore us\r\ndown, until we seemed to have no personalities of our own, even to each other.\r\nCertainly we spoke like him, but we could not hear it ourselves. We had to be\r\ntold of it first by strangers.\r\nThe Old Man seemed to burn us out: whenever he rode off on one of his\r\njourneys to raise money for the work or on business of his own, he left us behind\r\nhim, glad to have him gone. Yes, thrilled to have him gone—but dry and cold\r\nand light, like pieces of char or bits of cinder, like ash. When the Old Man left,\r\nwe did not speak much, not to one another, not to strangers.",
    "\r\nI meant here to write about how we spoke and why our speech was so strangely\r\nmannered. I see that I have done something else. I close now, as ash, again... or\r\nstill: I do not know which.\r\nChapter 9\r\nIt’s as if I’m actually living there, in North Elba, and in those olden times when I\r\nwas young. As if, weeks ago, when I first began speaking of it, I went tumbling\r\ndown some twisting, narrow shaft that emerged there. And now, still clambering\r\nalong a descending maze of tunnels and caves, I am unable to find my way back\r\nagain to the surface of the earth, to my cabin in Altadena and daylight. The only\r\nlight down inside these cold, rock-walled chambers is the light of memory\r\nflaring up, illuminating rough pictures and writings overhead, like those the\r\nIndians drew in ages past to invoke and placate their pagan gods. I stand below,\r\ngazing in wonder at the pictures, and the figures begin to move and speak, and\r\nmy wonder, as you have seen so many times in these pages, turns first to warmth\r\nof recognition, then to gladness, and then, as the story told by the figures grows\r\nviolent or somber, turns fearful and sad, I stumble backwards away from the\r\npictures and into the darkness of the cave again. Soon I am falling, scrambling,\r\nclawing my way along yet another shaft in this warren, until the floor beneath\r\nmy feet finally levels out, and once more I stop and stand, and when the light of\r\nmemory spreads from my face, I see in its glow that I have arrived in a new\r\nchamber... and there, up on the walls—a mingling of shadow and light—it\r\nmoves and dances ... and another, different event in my long-ago, half-forgotten\r\nlife commences to unfold before me!",
    "\r\nToday as I write I find myself still situated in the chamber of that first summer in\r\nNorth Elba, the summer of ’50, when I was twenty-six, and I am recalling that it\r\nwas for me an especially instructive time, perhaps because of the absence at the\r\nfarm of my recently married elder brothers, John and Jason, who were ranked\r\nabove me at that time in Father’s little army and who, therefore, normally would\r\nhave superseded me in the work. Father’s work. The Lord’s work, as he\r\nconstantly reminded us, of freeing the slaves. For until the slaves were free—as\r\nhe told us over and over again—none of us were free.\r\nTo Father, white and black Americans alike were bound by slavery: the\r\nphysical condition of the enslaved, he insisted, was the moral condition of the\r\nfree. This was not some vague, safely abstract principle, such as propounded by\r\nthe New England philosophers. No, for Father, quite literally, we Americans,\r\nwhite as much as black, Northern as much as Southern, anti-slave as much as\r\npro-, we were, all of us, presently living under the rule of Satan. It was an\r\ninarguable truth to Father that man’s essential task while on this earth was to\r\nbring both his personal and his civic life into total accord with the will and\r\noverarching law of God. And since a republic is a type of state that by definition\r\nis governed by laws created and enforced by its citizens, whenever in a republic\r\nthose laws do not conform to the laws of God, because those laws can be\r\nchanged by men, they must be changed by men. And not to change them placed\r\nthe mortal soul of every one of its citizens in terrible jeopardy. Not to struggle\r\nconstantly to overthrow the system of slavery was to abandon our Republic, was\r\nto surrender our civic freedoms and responsibilities, was to give our mortal souls\r\nover to the rule of Satan.",
    " We were obliged to oppose slavery, then, not merely to\r\npreserve and perfect the Republic, although that alone was a worthy enough\r\ntask, but to defeat Satan. It was our holy, our peculiarly American, obligation.\r\nSimple. Or so it seemed. For even though I understood Father’s logic well\r\nenough, I didn’t always understand his applications of that logic to the specific\r\ncircumstances, contingencies, and conditions that arose daily in our lives. Which\r\nmeant that, on a day-to-day basis, I sometimes did not know right from wrong.\r\nFor instance, there was the time—after we had passed the young Negro\r\ncouple, Emma and James Cannon, on to safety, as we assumed—when we\r\ndiscovered that, in fact, there was considerable evidence that they had murdered\r\ntheir master and that there was indeed a warrant from the Commonwealth of\r\nVirginia for their arrest and return. When this came out, many of the whites in\r\nNorth Elba grew fearful and angry. These were the same, good people who,\r\nbefore this episode, as I have shown, had been quietly aiding Father and me and\r\nvarious of the Negroes of Timbuctoo in our attempts to spirit escaped slaves\r\nnorthward. Now, however, they wished us to cease this activity. And I found\r\nmyself in partial agreement with them.\r\nOne day several weeks after our misadventure with Billingsly, the bounty-\r\nhunter, there appeared up at our farm a United States marshal from Albany—\r\naccompanied by the ever-helpful Mr. Partridge of Keene. Bearing a warrant for\r\nthe immediate arrest and return of Emma and James Cannon for the murder of\r\ntheir owner, one Mr. Samuel Cannon of Richmond, Virginia, the marshal put to\r\nFather, as he had to numerous others in the village, a set of pointed questions\r\nregarding the whereabouts of the couple. Though his interrogation of Father was\r\nclearly based on detailed information that had been provided by his guide, Mr.",
    "\r\nPartridge, the marshal appeared to know nothing of our burly encounter in Port\r\nKent with Mr. Billingsly. Which was natural: it was not, after all, in the bounty-\r\nhunter’s interest to aid and abet the capture of his prey by a salaried officer of\r\nthe law, and thus it was unlikely that he would have reported, even to his\r\nhelper, Mr. Partridge, our having briefly kidnapped him, an incident he probably\r\nregarded with a certain degree of embarrassment anyhow.\r\nWhen Father simply answered that he knew nothing of the Negro couple, there\r\nwas little the marshal could do but pass north to the next known stop on the\r\nRailroad, there to interrogate the Quaker Captain Keifer. Up there, most officers\r\nof the law in those days had a pretty good idea of who was working on the\r\nUnderground Railroad and who was not and, unless prodded by warrants and\r\nwrits, did little to obstruct them.\r\nIt was our white neighbors, the Brewsters, the Nashes, and even Mr.\r\nThompson, who, when they learned of the warrant for the arrest of the Cannons,\r\ngrew frightened and came to Father and spoke angrily against our having\r\nescorted murderers north. Father sat on his stool and, while the men stood\r\naround him, heard them out. They were a delegation of three, apparently chosen\r\nto represent to Father the views and desires of the entire community. As known\r\nabolitionists themselves and friends of John Brown, they were no doubt thought\r\nto be more likely to get a hearing from him than if others, less sympathetic to\r\nthe cause, had come.\r\nMr. Thompson was their spokesman. “Helping slaves to escape from slavery is\r\na good thing to do,” he said. “A good thing. Upright. But, really, John, helping to\r\nspirit known murderers out of the country—that’s a different matter altogether.",
    "”\r\nHe told Father that, as we Browns could not assure the community that the\r\npeople we were escorting to freedom were decent Christians and not criminals or\r\nmoral reprobates, it was our neighbors’ wish that we cease our activities at once.\r\nIt was partly a consequence, he said, of our insistence on working outside and\r\nseparate from the churches and other white institutions and individuals who\r\ncould provide our cargo with bona fides to certify that the fugitives were not\r\ncriminals. But it was also a consequence, he pointed out, of Father’s\r\ndetermination to work with the Negroes of Timbuctoo, especially with men like\r\nElden Fleete and Lyman Epps, men who, Mr. Thompson and the others believed,\r\nhad no particular interest in farming here. All the whites but Father, Mr.\r\nThompson pointed out, had come here to North Elba solely to farm and raise\r\ntheir families in peace and security. Even many of the Negroes had come here\r\nfor that purpose. Now, however, everyone, white and black alike, was being\r\ninterrogated by a United States marshal, and bounty-hunters like Billingsly and\r\nlazy rascals like Partridge had taken to skulking around the place. “Let the\r\nabolitionist Negroes themselves, Fleete and Epps, conduct escaping slaves, or\r\npeople who claim to be escaping slaves, on to Canada on their own, if that’s\r\nwhat they want to do with their time,” Mr. Thompson told Father. “But we\r\nwhites, John, we should stay clear of it. Completely.”\r\nHe took a long while to make his case, and when he had finished, Father stood\r\nand drew himself up to his full height, which was not exceptional, but because of\r\nhis large face, he often appeared quite tall. He said, “Gentlemen, you are all my\r\nfriends. And I would like to put you at your ease, but I cannot just now.",
    " I will\r\nmake my complete answer to your charges and concerns, but I prefer to make it\r\nto the entire community, and not just you three. I’ll do it come Sunday morning\r\nin the church, where I have grown accustomed to speaking now and then. I\r\nwould be pleased if you gave this out to the others, so that all who have an\r\ninterest in the matter may hear me.”\r\nThen, with no further ceremony or words, he let them out of the house and, by\r\nabruptly turning his back and shutting fast the door, dismissed them.\r\nThat Sunday morning, a cold, rainy day, I remember, we all, including Lyman\r\nand Susan Epps, rode in the wagon into the village of North Elba and marched\r\ninto the little white Presbyterian church there and took our accustomed seats in\r\nour usual pew towards the front. We sat in a single row, with Father on the aisle.\r\nThere was an unusually large turnout, for this matter had generated considerable\r\nheat and feeling in the town. The small chapel was packed with red-faced\r\nfarmers and their families and smelled of their boots and wet wool clothing. The\r\nentire Thompson clan was present, taking up two pews to our one, and I noted\r\nRuth and young Henry Thompson exchange a significantly friendly glance, and I\r\nremember saying to myself, A-ha! What have we here?\r\nThe preacher, the Reverend Spofford Hall from Vermont, a scrawny, somewhat\r\ninsipid fellow whom Father abhorred for his lax liberalism in religion, gave out\r\nwith his usual, mechanical invocation, after which the small choir stood and\r\nsang the opening hymn. Sang it with unaccustomed force, I thought, due perhaps\r\nto four of the eight being Negroes from the settlement, who must have known\r\nthat there was scheduled in today’s ceremonies a thing of particular significance\r\nto them.",
    " They sounded like a choir three times their size, and Father’s knees\r\njoggled up and down in close time to the music, and his eyes glistened happily\r\nas they sang.\r\nAt last, the Reverend Hall stepped to the lectern set before the spare, New\r\nEngland-style altar and announced in his high, watery voice, “Today our\r\nneighbor Mister Brown will address us.” Then he stood down and turned the\r\nmeeting over to Father.\r\nIt was a sermon that I had heard by then numerous times and listened to often\r\nenough afterwards, and I can hear the Old Man’s voice today, these many years\r\nlater, as clearly as I did that cold, gray morning in North Elba. I see him standing\r\nthere, straight as a tree, screw-faced and tense, his wet, fox-red hair sticking up,\r\nand I listen to him begin his first sentence, and as I write, my mouth seems to\r\nopen, as if I am to speak his entire sermon for him, word for word.\r\n“Good morning, neighbors” the Old Man said.\r\n“Though outside these walls the rain falls, and the mountains be all hid in\r\nclouds, and though the chilled wind today blows out of the northwest, we here\r\ninside our small sanctuary are dry and warm together, are we not?\r\n“We are comfortable, friends and neighbors, and we are safe, and we sing\r\npraises to the Lord, our heavenly Father, and we offer Him our prayers of\r\nthanksgiving, so as to signify our pleasure and our heartfelt gratitude to Him\r\nwho, at His pleasure, hath granted that comfort and that safety to us. Do we not?\r\n“Comfort and safety which has been granted to us—we who clear the forests,\r\nwe who till the fields, we who raise our livestock. Little people of the valley\r\nbetween the mountains, that is what we are, friends. Men, women, and children\r\nstruggling merely to survive and if possible to prosper in a hard place in a hard\r\ntime. Are we not?\r\n“Comfort and safety granted to us—who deserve nothing.",
    " Who deserve neither\r\ncomfort nor safety, certainly, but who deserve neither discomfort nor danger,\r\neither. Understand me—granted to us, who deserve nothing! Not even to exist. Is\r\nthis not the case, friends?\r\n“I speak of everyone in the community, all of us—the blackest and the poorest\r\namong us, and the whitest and the richest. The most innocent, and the most\r\nfoully corrupted. The most pious, and the least pious. The young, and the old.\r\nFor we do not, not a one of us, deserve to live. It is not something the Lord owes\r\nus! Can you argue with that, friends?\r\n“So that, if there is a debt, neighbors, if there is something that is owed\r\nsomeone, then it runs the other way, does it not?\r\n“For who among us asked to be born? Who among us made such a request?\r\nNo, white or black, rich or poor, not a one of us had such a right or even the\r\nmeans to make that request. And now, having been born, having been granted\r\nair to breathe and a place to stand upon, having been shown a firmament set\r\nbetween the firmaments, having been wakened from the dreamless sleep of\r\nnothingness, now, who among us can say, This was owed me, this was long owed\r\nme? Or even, This, Lord, did I request of Thee?\r\n“The Lord giveth, neighbors, and the Lord taketh away. And does He not do so\r\nat His pleasure, friends? Not ours! No, it is only at the Lord’s own pleasure that\r\nwe exist, is it not?\r\n“We cannot cajole Him, we cannot argue our case, as if He were an\r\nElizabethtown judge and we a plaintiff’s attorney. We cannot even beg. No, all\r\nwe poor people can do, having come to an awareness of our lives, is give thanks.\r\nGive thanks, and then live out our lives according to that high, holy purpose, the\r\npurpose of continuing to give thanks, over and over again, amen.\r\n“Contemplate the alternative, neighbors. Briefly, just briefly, is all—for to\r\ncontemplate that alternative is truly painful.",
    " Nothingness is the alternative! A\r\nblasted absence! Contemplate nothingness for a few short seconds, neighbors,\r\nand you will turn away in horror, and then you will give thanks unto the Lord.\r\nThen you will sing His praises. And you will leap and dance with joy! Not for the\r\npleasure of being alive, for life is all too often no pleasure whatsoever, but you\r\nwill leap and dance with joy and thanksgiving for having had the opportunity to\r\nexist at all!\r\n“I am thinking, this rainy, cold morning, neighbors, of old Job. A farmer and\r\nstockman, like many of us here. I am thinking of a pious man with a large,\r\nloving family who, like us, lived in a broad valley surrounded by mountains,\r\nwhere there were wolves and lions and bears, where the cold winds blew in\r\nwinter, and where, beyond the mountains, there were enemies lurking who\r\ncoveted his fields and crops and envied the peacefulness and the fruitfulness of\r\nhis life. Can you imagine Job as a man very like us? Can you?\r\n“Against these enemies, and against the wolves and lions and bears, against\r\nthe cold winds of winter and the drought of summer, against sickness and\r\nplague, old Job and his loving family and neighbors nonetheless prospered and\r\nthrived, and they and their livestock multiplied in their numbers, until they had\r\nbecome a community in that ancient wilderness, a community much like ours\r\nhere in our modern, American wilderness.\r\n“And these good folks, old Job and his family and friends, they did everything\r\nright. They did it just so. In this they were perhaps superior even to us here in\r\nNorth Elba. For we are sometimes slack and slothful, are we not? And some of us\r\nkeep not the usual observances in religion, and from time to time we mistreat\r\none another in our families, or we fall to quarreling with each other, do we not?",
    "\r\nBut Job and his family and friends, they were, one and all, a consistently upright\r\npeople. Especially Job, the Bible tells us. Especially Job. He was a man who,\r\neven in that fine a community, was outstanding and much admired. Admired for\r\nhis piety, his judgement, and his decorum, admired for his kindness and\r\ngenerosity, for his integrity, and for his willingness to keep all God’s\r\ncommandments. Do you remember the story?\r\n“If we ourselves here today could be like any man in the Holy Bible,\r\nneighbors, we would be like Job. Am I right? Not for his wealth, naturally—\r\nalthough he had plenty of that, and we wouldn’t turn it away. And not simply\r\nfor the respect and admiration that he obtained from his family and neighbors,\r\nalthough none of us would scorn those. And not for his wisdom and clarity of\r\nmind, either.\r\n“No, we would want to be like Job because of his simple goodness, his\r\nstraightforward decency, and his charitableness. Recall the story. Job was a man\r\nwho rested easy with himself, the Bible says. We have all known one or two men\r\nlike that, and we might have envied them, but for the fact that in envying them\r\nwe would have become less like them than before, for one of their main virtues\r\nwas that they envied no man. And so we have tried strictly to love such men and\r\nto emulate them, have we not?\r\n“Well, old Job was an easy man to love. Even God, who loves all men equally,\r\nregarded Job as especially admirable, and thus, when Satan sat down on a rock\r\nto criticize these poor, forked creatures that were so beloved of God, the Lord\r\nsingled out Job for special praise. In this story, friends, the key to Satan’s\r\nmotives is that he did not comprehend God’s love of mankind, not even of Job,\r\nthe best of mankind, the champion human being of us all back in those ancient\r\nBiblical days.",
    " And so Satan spoke to God of mankind as if we were not worthy of\r\nGod’s love, and he said that, therefore, God should withdraw His love. ‘Take it\r\noff from them,’ Satan said.\r\n“You remember the story, neighbors. Satan argued with the Lord that the only\r\nreason we humans were in the slightest obedient to the Lord’s commandments\r\nwas because we expected and often received large rewards for it. For it was true,\r\nand it remaineth so, that we are far more likely to prosper when we keep His\r\ncommandments than when we do not keep them.\r\n“But Satan insinuated that we were a shrewdly calculating lot. That we were\r\nhypocrites. And thus we were not worthy of God’s love. And if we were not\r\nworthy of God’s love, Satan reasoned, then we were not worthy of the existence\r\nthat He had granted us even without our asking.\r\n“A gift unimagined is the gift of God’s love. Our very existence is that\r\nunimagined gift. That, neighbors and friends, that is why there is something and,\r\nfor us, not merely nothing! God’s love is the universe’s first and only cause,\r\nneighbors.\r\n“Well, no one ever called Satan a fool, did they? Throughout the Bible he is\r\ncalled many things, but never foolish. No, sir. He took a long look at this man\r\ncalled Job, this fine man living out there in the land of Uz with his seven sons\r\nand three daughters, his seven thousand sheep and his three thousand camels\r\nand his five hundred yoke of oxen—quite a plantation was Job’s place out there\r\nin Uz. And Satan said to the Lord, ‘You know that fellow Job, the one you’re\r\nalways bragging about, the man you’re so high on? Well, he’s a hypocrite, too.\r\nEven he!’\r\n“The Lord saith, Ah, yes, my servant Job! But you’re wrong. Job is a perfect\r\nman. He’s the most upright of them all, and he fears me, and he eschews evil.’\r\nThus saith the Lord, neighbors.",
    "\r\n“Satan said, ‘Sure, of course, he fears you and eschews evil and makes all the\r\nproper observances and so on. But it’s not for nothing. Look at the hedge you’ve\r\nbuilt around the man. Look how he’s rewarded for it. But just put forth thine\r\nhand against him, Lord, and the man will curse thee to thine face,’ said Satan.\r\n‘Believe me, that fellow Job, he’s a hypocrite! declared Satan. The same as the\r\nrest. He may be the best amongst men, but even he is a hypocrite.’\r\n“And so the Lord gave Satan permission to do with Job as he wished, so long\r\nas he did not slay him. All that old Job hath is in thy power,’ saith the Lord to\r\nSatan. ‘Go ahead, take away everything, and you’ll see what sort of man we have\r\nhere.’\r\n“You remember the story, neighbors. First came the Sabeans, who slew Job’s\r\noxen and his asses and even put the servants attending them to the sword. And\r\njust as Job was absorbing the news of this loss, another messenger came in and\r\ntold him that fire had fallen from the sky and burned up all his sheep. And then\r\nthree bands of Chaldeans fell upon Job’s camels, slew the servants attending\r\nthem, and stole the camels away to Chaldea. And then came the worst thing,\r\nfriends. Remember? While Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking\r\nwine together in the house of the eldest son, a great wind howled out of the\r\nwilderness and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon them and\r\nkilled them all!\r\n“And what did poor Job do in the face of these terrible events? Did he charge\r\nthe Lord foolishly? Did he rail against God, as you or I might have done? No, Job\r\nrent his mantle and shaved his head, and he made a public showing of his\r\nsorrow by returning himself as if to his infancy, bald and naked as a babe. And\r\nthen he fell down upon the ground, and, friends, he worshipped the Lord!",
    " ‘Naked\r\ncame I out of my mother’s womb; he said, ‘and naked shall I return thither. The\r\nLord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord!’\r\n“This, neighbors, was no hypocrite!\r\n“But Satan wasn’t satisfied yet. ‘He hath his life still! Satan pointed out to the\r\nLord. ‘But just put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone, and touch his flesh,\r\nand Job will curse thee to thy face.’\r\n“The Lord said, ‘Go on, try him.’ So Satan went forth, and he smote old Job\r\nwith sore boils from his foot to his crown. He smote him so badly that the poor\r\nman could only sit in agony among ashes, scraping his enflamed flesh with a\r\npotsherd. Such a figure of pathos and ruination was he that even his wife came\r\nout and said to him, ‘So, Job, dost thou still retain thine integrity? Curse God,\r\nand die,’ she said to him. ‘Husband, curse God and die.’ Harsh words, neighbors,\r\nare they not?\r\n“But wise old Job, he said to his wife, ‘Shall we receive good at the hand of\r\nGod and not evil also? Foolish woman! he said to her, but she understood him\r\nnot and left him alone there in the ashes.\r\n“You remember the story, neighbors. Then from the town came Job’s three\r\nfriends to comfort and grieve with him. Eliphaz and Bildad and Zophar were\r\ntheir names, and for seven days and seven nights they listened to Job recount his\r\nsorrows and curse, not God, never God, but his birth, his very birth.\r\n“Old Eliphaz the Temanite—a sensible man, we would say, if he came among\r\nus today in North Elba—Eliphaz argued that Job must have somehow offended\r\nGod. ‘For who ever perished! he said to Job, ‘who was also innocent? Tell me,\r\nwhere were the righteous cut off? Happy is the man,’ reasoned the Temanite,\r\n‘whom God correcteth. Cheer up,’ he told Job.",
    " ‘You are being chastized by the\r\nFather for your failings’\r\n“Have you not also been consoled like this, friends, in times of great suffering?\r\n“‘Oh, if only that were the case!’ was Job’s answer. ‘Oh, that my grief and my\r\ncalamity were so evenly weighed in the balance together!’\r\n“And so Bildad the Shuhite spoke unto Job. ‘Surely, friend Job, surely God\r\nwould not cast away a perfect man,’he said. And neither will he keep an evil-\r\ndoer. You cannot beone,’said Bildad to Job, ‘so you must perforce be the other.’\r\n“But Job cried, ‘No, no, no, a thousand times no! If I justify myself to the Lord,\r\nmine own mouth shall condemn me. If I say I am perfect, He shall prove me\r\nperverse. The Lord destroyeth the perfect and the wicked alike! Even if I were\r\nrighteous,’ Job said to his friend and neighbor Bildad, ‘I would not answer with\r\nthat. Instead, I would make supplication only to my Judge. For look ye, He\r\nbreaketh me without cause! And you, Bildad, you do not understand any of this.’\r\n“But we understand, do we not, neighbors?\r\n“Then Job’s friend Zophar the Naamathite gave it a try. ‘You must be lying,’ he\r\nsaid as kindly as he could. ‘You say to us that thy doctrine is clean, and thou art\r\nclean in the Lord’s eyes. Well, Job, old friend, that cannot be, else you would not\r\nbe in such a catastrophic condition. So confess, my brother. Prepare thine heart,\r\nand stretch out thy hands before thee towards Him. And then the Lord will\r\nreward thee!’\r\n“And Job said to Zophar, ‘No, no, no, no! Look around you, fool! Everywhere\r\nthe tabernacles are full of robbers, and they prosper. Everywhere those who\r\nprovoke God are secure. Therefore, you, my friends and neighbors,’saith Job to\r\nZophar, Bildad, and Eliphaz, ‘you are all physicians of no value.’\r\n“Hear me, friends and neighbors of this village of North Elba. Hear me.",
    " Job\r\nsaid, ‘You speak wickedly for God and talk deceitfully for Him. You speak in\r\nyour own interests only. Does not His excellency make you afraid? Does it not\r\nmake you tremble?\r\n“As for me,’ Job said to his friends and neighbors—and here I come to the\r\npoint of my preachment to you—Job said, As for me, though the Lord slay me,\r\nyet will I trust in Him and will maintain mine own ways before Him. Miserable\r\ncomforters are ye all!’ Job said to them. ‘Ye believe that one might plead with\r\nGod as a man pleadeth with his neighbor. I cannot find one wise man among\r\nyou.’\r\n“Have ye not known such miserable comforters as these, friends? They are all\r\naround us, are they not? Why, we might even be them ourselves, might we not?\r\n“Where, then, neighbors, shall wisdom be found? And where lieth the place of\r\nunderstanding?\r\n“Behold. I, John Brown, I say to you that it is just as the Bible shows us. The\r\nfear of the Lord, that is wisdom. And to depart from evil, that is understanding.\r\n“And you will remember, neighbors, from the old story, there came a\r\nwhirlwind, and out of the whirlwind the Lord answered Job’s cry. ‘Of Job’s\r\nfriends and neighbors,’ the Lord saith, ‘who is this that darkeneth counsel by\r\nwords without knowledge? And where was’t thou,’the Lord saith to Eliphaz,\r\nBildad, and Zophar, ‘where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?\r\nWhere wast thou when I placed the firmament between the firmaments?’\r\n“To them the Lord saith, ‘My wrath is kindled against thee! For you have not\r\nspoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.’ And the Lord took\r\nfrom them seven bullocks and seven rams each and gave them unto Job. And He\r\nblessed the latter end of Job’s life even more than at the beginning with sheep\r\nand camels and oxen and asses, and He gave him seven sons more and three\r\ndaughters.\r\n“Well, neighbors, there you have it.",
    " My answer to your charges against me!\r\nNow, shall I tell thee the meaning of the story of Job? Shall I again compare us\r\nhere in this sanctuary today to old Job out there in Uz, a man of principle?\r\n“Or shall I instead compare us to his friends and neighbors, to Eliphaz, Bildad,\r\nand Zophar, whose hypocrisy kindled the wrath of the Lord against them? Which\r\nof these ancients resembles us more?\r\n“For, look, ye have counseled me exactly as Job’s wife counseled him. Ye have\r\ntold me to forsake my integrity and curse God.\r\n“Ye hath brayed at me like Eliphaz. Ye hath spoken out against me as if\r\nwisdom were thine and thy feet were set in the place of understanding.\r\n“Remember, neighbors, in the fear of the Lord, that is where wisdom lies. And\r\nto depart from evil, that is understanding. And that is all ye need to know.\r\n“I say to you, miserable comforters! physicians of no value! I tell thee here and\r\nnow that I and my family shall continue as before—to fear the Lord and to\r\ndepart from evil. We seek wisdom and understanding. Those are our principles.\r\nWe shall live by our principles. You, my good neighbors, you may do as you\r\nwish.”\r\nHere the Old Man completed his remarks and stepped down and rejoined the\r\ncongregation. When he had taken his seat, he lowered his head in prayer, and\r\nfirst Mary, next to him, and then the rest of us alongside in the pew did likewise,\r\nand as I myself, the last in our group to do so, lowered my head, I noticed that\r\nthere were a good many other people amongst the congregation who were also\r\nfollowing Father’s example, as if in this argument with Job they wished\r\npointedly to separate themselves from the side of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.",
    "\r\nA moment later, the Reverend Hall walked up to the lectern, and although the\r\nservice resumed in its usual manner, I was not aware of it, for my thoughts were\r\nturning around the meaning of Father’s talk. I felt myself surrounded by a\r\nbuzzing light, as if by a swarm of golden bees, and I had to struggle to hear my\r\nthoughts. A terrible understanding had come over me in the midst of Father’s\r\ntalk, and I did not want to lose it, in spite of its being fearsome and threatening\r\nto me.\r\nIn Father’s words, the figure of Job was, of course, like no one so much as\r\nFather himself. As Job stood to God, Father did also. My terrible understanding\r\nwas that I, too, was like no one so much as Job. Not, however, in my relation to\r\nGod; but in my relation to Father.\r\nWho was Satan to me, then? Who would test my faithfulness to Father by\r\nafflicting me as Satan had afflicted Job? Would I, too, come to curse the day I\r\nwas born? Would I beg for my own death, as Job had cried out for his and, as I\r\nknew, Father, in his periods of greatest despondency, had also? Would I, like\r\nJob, like Father, be able to resist the blandishments and sophistries of the\r\nhypocrites?\r\nIn the Bible, Job is rewarded at the end for his faithfulness to the Lord, he\r\nreceives from Him new cattle and new children, and Satan is sent packing, along\r\nwith Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. But, as Father showed, Job’s reward is given\r\nas evidence of God’s power, not His justice. This is what the hypocrites found\r\nbeyond their understanding. The moral of the story would be the same even if\r\nGod had not rewarded Job at the end, for it was done merely to punish the\r\nhypocrites and confound Satan, not to comfort Job.\r\nWho, then, in Father’s story of my life, plays the role of Satan? Who wishes to\r\nprove me a hypocrite?",
    "\r\nThe terrible answer, the only possible answer, was that anyone who opposes\r\nFather as Satan opposes God, could, if I merely questioned Father, prove me a\r\nhypocrite. That answer turned me into a trapped animal, a fox with a paw\r\nclamped in an iron-toothed jaw. To escape it, I would be obliged to gnaw at my\r\nown flesh and separate my body from itself. Freed, I would be a crippled little\r\nbeast unable to care for himself, unable even to flee. I would have obtained\r\nfreedom, yes, but freedom for what? To huddle alone in the bushes nearby, there\r\nto die slowly of my self-inflicted wounds. No, I thought. Better the intimacy of\r\niron against my wrist. Better the familiarity of my own teeth closed inside my\r\nmouth. Better boils, a potsherd, ashes. Better to curse ever having been born.\r\nPredictably, with a few changes made—none of them, however, designed to\r\nplacate the wishes of our white neighbors—Father went straight back to work on\r\nthe Underground Railroad. In his mind, all our white neighbors were now\r\ncowards and hypocrites, every one of them, and periodically he denounced them\r\nto any of us in the family who would listen. He denounced even his good friend\r\nMr. Thompson, for, although the Old Man at first thought that he had\r\nsuccessfully shamed our neighbors with his sermon, his message evidently hadn’t\r\ntaken hold: no one in the village was willing anymore to aid him in his efforts to\r\nspirit fugitive slaves out of the country—except, of course, for the Negroes\r\nthemselves. And except for the rest of us Browns. Meaning me, I suppose,\r\nalthough there was considerable sacrifice required as well of the others in the\r\nfamily, who had to accommodate themselves to Father’s and my and Lyman’s\r\nfrequent and protracted absences from the farm.\r\nThe most significant change in our modus operandi, however, was in cutting\r\nMr.",
    " Wilkinson of the Tahawus mining camp out of the operation. In a flurry of\r\nletters to Mr. Frederick Douglass in Rochester, Father made it clear that he\r\nwould not work with the man. Thenceforth, cargo from the South would have to\r\nbe shipped to Father in North Elba via an agent named Reuben Shiloh, in care of\r\na Mrs. Ebenezer Rankin, resident of the town of Long Lake, New York, a small,\r\nrough lumbering community in the southern Adirondack wilderness about forty\r\nmiles from North Elba. Reuben Shiloh was in fact Father himself, a pseudonym.\r\nMrs. Rankin, his point of contact in Long Lake, was the elderly widow of a\r\nveteran of the War of the Revolution. She lived alone in a cabin on the land her\r\nhusband had homesteaded after the war, was regarded in the village as mildly\r\neccentric and harmless, and, due to her deep religious feeling and independence\r\nof spirit, was sympathetic to the cause. Father first met her after a sermon he\r\nhad made on the subject of abolitionism at the Congregational church there in\r\nLong Lake and, as was his wont, had trusted her instantly. Generally, the Old\r\nMan made decisions as to a person’s trustworthiness at once and without\r\nconsulting others. When it had to do with business matters, of course, he was\r\nusually wrong, well off the mark, absurdly so; but when it concerned the\r\nquestion of slavery, he was almost always right.\r\n“It’s a thing you can tell in an instant. You know it from a person’s speech or\r\nthe cast of his eyes, as soon as you begin to speak with him on the subject of\r\nrace,” he said, trying to explain his procedure. “Early on, Owen, I conceived the\r\nidea of placing myself, when speaking of such matters with white people, in the\r\nposition of a Negro.",
    "” Which is to say that he listened to whites and watched\r\nthem as if his self-respect, his well-being, his very life, were always at stake, and\r\nconsequently, as he claimed, he quickly saw things that most whites ignore or\r\nblind themselves to. For example, if he spoke of the horrors of slavery to a\r\nstranger and the man’s face went all slack and sad over it, as if he wished to be\r\nadmired for the tenderness of his feelings, then Father knew not to trust him. But\r\nif the man reacted, not with sadness and regret, but with righteous wrathfulness,\r\nthen he would brighten and feel secure in confiding in that person. Father said\r\nhe loved seeing that old-time righteous anger fill up a white man’s face. It\r\nhappened rarely, however. “No, Owen” he said, “when it comes to race and\r\nslavery, white people, try as they may, cannot hide their true feelings. Not to\r\ntheir fellow Americans who happen to be born black, that is. And not to me,\r\neither. Only to themselves.”\r\nMr. Wilkinson of Tahawus had not hidden his true feelings, not even from me,\r\nand I believe that he somewhat resented being cut away from the operation, not\r\nout of any love for the Negro or some deep desire to help destroy slavery, but\r\nbecause his work on the Railroad made it significantly easier for him to view\r\nhimself as a man who acted kindly towards people he regarded as his inferiors.\r\nPerhaps he believed that by working for the Underground Railroad and\r\nalongside Father, whose motives were pure, he might be able to strike a balance\r\nagainst his hard treatment of the indentured Irish miners and their families.",
    " At\r\nany rate, soon after he was dropped by the wayside, he joined, unbeknownst to\r\nus, with our known enemies, with the slave-catchers and bounty-hunters, with\r\nthe folks in the region who regarded us as fanatical trouble-makers, and with the\r\nmarshal from Albany, whose pursuit of the Virginia couple accused of murdering\r\ntheir master had continued throughout the summer.\r\nThe marshal, whose name was Saunders, had gotten himself caught in a\r\nsqueeze between the Canadian and American authorities and also between the\r\nstates of Virginia and New York, as the Canadians, after conducting an extensive\r\ninvestigation, had asserted unequivocably that the Cannons had never crossed\r\nthe border at all. The authorities in Virginia insisted that the couple had been\r\nlast located over in New-Trenton, New York, where they had been detained\r\nbriefly by a local deputy whom they had somehow bribed to leave their cell door\r\nunlocked—the money for the bribe possibly originating with Mr. Douglass, who\r\nhad visited the couple during their brief confinement. The New-Trenton deputy\r\nwas himself now awaiting trial, and in order to save his own skin was telling\r\nMarshal Saunders everything he knew or thought he knew about the Cannons\r\nand their confederates.\r\nMeanwhile, we were moving regular shipments of human cargo over Father’s,\r\nor Reuben Shiloh’s, new link between Long Lake and North Elba, and due to the\r\nrising vigilance of the authorities and the greater presence of slave-catchers west\r\nof us in Buffalo and east of us in Troy, our cargo was increasing significantly in\r\nvolume and degree of risk, so that three or four times a week we were obliged to\r\nmake a run down along the old Military Road from North Elba through the pine\r\nforests and across the swamps and muskegs to the cabin of Mrs.",
    " Rankin, where\r\nwe loaded up and then raced back through the night to Timbuctoo, and the next\r\nnight moved our cargo on to Port Kemp, where Captain Keifer carried it aboard\r\nhis boat and sailed it north to Canada.\r\nIt was a wild and exciting time. We were like a gang of outlaws, Lyman and I\r\nand Mr. Fleete and Father, armed and reckless, and several times we narrowly\r\nescaped capture. Lyman seemed to have found his proper vocation. He grew\r\nstern and brave and was no longer so garrulous and puffed up as he had\r\nsometimes been earlier. Our days on the farm now seemed merely to be resting\r\nperiods, interludes that we impatiently waited out, until we again received word\r\nfrom Mrs. Rankin that a new shipment for Reuben Shiloh had arrived in Long\r\nLake, and we would be off, Father and Mr. Fleete on horseback, Lyman and I in\r\nthe wagon, with our guns close at hand and supplies and tarpaulins and blankets\r\nstashed in the bed of the wagon. At Mrs. Rankin’s cabin we’d hole up for the\r\ndaylight hours in the shed she had out back, beneath which we had early on dug\r\na secret cellar hidingplace where the escaped slaves could await our arrival\r\nundetected. And then at sundown we’d load the fugitives into the wagon—men,\r\nwomen, and children in various combinations. We’d cover them with the\r\ntarpaulin and race back northeast to Timbuctoo, and if we made good time, we’d\r\nkeep right on towards Port Kent, arriving there just before sunrise, and Captain\r\nKeifer would transfer the cargo from our wagon to his boat. Later that same day,\r\nusually in the afternoon, we would pull into the yard in front of the house in\r\nNorth Elba, men and animals alike exhausted and hungry, and we’d eat and fall\r\ninto bed and sleep like corpses for ten or twelve hours.\r\nTwice, I remember, we were accosted by law officers—a sheriff in Long Lake\r\nand a deputy U.S.",
    " marshal in Ausable Forks—but on both occasions our wagon\r\nwas empty, and after suffering a brief and surly interrogation, we were allowed\r\nto continue unimpeded. Nonetheless, we were ready for the worst. Although we\r\nweren’t actually pursued at any time and thus weren’t obliged to fire our\r\nweapons, there was always the danger of betrayal and discovery. People would\r\nlook up from their work in the fields and woodlots and stare at us as we passed\r\nby or peer out the windows of their bedrooms late in the night when the sound\r\nof our horses’ hooves and the loud rattle and clack of the wagon disturbed their\r\nsleep. Those people must have known who we were and what we were up to.\r\nOur operation, however, was narrow, secretive, and private, cut off from any\r\ncommunications with the communities that surrounded us, cut off, even, from\r\nthe rest of the anti-slavery movement and its committees and churches and the\r\nold mainlines of the Underground Railroad. We worked in a kind of darkness\r\nand solitude, as if no one else on the planet were engaged in the same or similar\r\nactivities. As if there were no one who was not utterly opposed to our activities.\r\nAnd, as had happened in the past, back in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where for an\r\nextended period we shuttled fugitive slaves successfully out of the South into\r\nCanada, we got caught up in the day-to-day rhythms and excitement of the\r\nwork, and this put us off the larger rhythms of the movement as a whole. It was\r\nas if our little four-man operation, our overnight link between Long Lake and\r\nPort Kent, New York, were the entire anti-slavery program for America.",
    " It wasn’t\r\narrogance or pride that did it, although it did sometimes seem that Father\r\nhonestly believed that under his leadership our work was more crucial to the\r\nmovement than any other and that it was more rigorous and disciplined, morally\r\nclearer, better planned, and more efficiently executed than the work of everyone\r\nelse—beliefs dangerously close to arrogance and pride. No, we lost sight of the\r\nlarger picture because we were obliged to respond constantly and quickly day in\r\nand out to the immediate needs of desperate people who had entrusted their\r\nlives to us. And just as we forgot about the helpful existence of our distant or\r\nindirect allies, we forgot about the conniving actions of our distant and indirect\r\nenemies. We operated without reconnoiter and in the absence of intelligence.\r\nThus we were not prepared for the re-appearance, one hot August afternoon,\r\nof Marshal Saunders at the farm in North Elba. He arrived on horseback in the\r\ncompany of a pair of sober-visaged deputies, bearing testimony from Mr.\r\nWilkinson of the Tahawus mining camp, who the marshal claimed had accused\r\nFather and me and two unnamed Negroes presently residing in the vicinity of\r\nNorth Elba of having aided and abetted the escape of the indicted murderers\r\nJames and Emma Cannon, of Richmond, Virginia.\r\nThe officers came up on us shortly after we had returned from a two-night run\r\nto Port Kent with four Maryland Negroes—an elderly man, his daughter, and her\r\ntwo nearly grown sons. Our wagon was empty, and Father and I, fortunately,\r\nwere alone, as Lyman had accompanied Mr. Fleete back to Timbuctoo, there to\r\nrest and afterwards to do some much needed blacksmithing among the Negro\r\nfarmers.\r\nWe were standing outside the house by the water trough, stripped to our\r\nwaists, washing ourselves.",
    " The boys and the women, including Lyman’s wife,\r\nSusan, were cutting the first crop of hay in the front field. Father looked up at\r\nthe three men, who sat relaxed and open-faced on their horses as if they meant\r\nus no harm. Introductions were not necessary, and Marshal Saunders got straight\r\nto the point of this his second visit to our farm. When he had told us of Mr.\r\nWilkinson’s betrayal, he said, “Mister Brown, I’ve not come here to charge you\r\nand your son with anything. I’m here peaceable. But I do need to know the\r\nnames of the two colored men who helped you carry the Cannons through here.\r\nIt wasn’t but a month ago,” he said, with a slow smile. “You no doubt recall their\r\nnames.”\r\nFather dried himself deliberately and said nothing. He looked at me, and I saw\r\nhis boiling rage. Then he passed the drying cloth to me.\r\n“If we helped anyone named Cannon, and I don’t recall that we did, but if we\r\ndid, then my son and I did it alone,” Father said. “Wilkinson is a liar.”\r\nMarshal Saunders said that he was looking for a slim, dark Negro man in his\r\ntwenties and a heavy-set mulatto man in his fifties with a full beard. “I’m going\r\nto assume, Mister Brown, that you and your son here didn’t have no notion that\r\nthe coloreds from Virginia was murderers, all right? And you thought you was\r\nonly helping a couple of escaped slaves scoot through to Canada, that’s all. Just\r\nas was the case with Mister Wilkinson down there at Tahawus. And I don’t\r\nconsider him a liar, sir. I realize that you all were only doing what you thought\r\nwas your Christian duty. Your Negro associates, however, probably knew better.\r\nThey have their little secrets that they keep from us,” he said sourly. He believed\r\nthat they probably knew where the Cannons were hiding. His aim was to cut a\r\ndeal with our friends. The same deal, he said, that he was cutting with us.",
    " If they\r\ncould give him some small help in locating the Cannons, then he wouldn’t press\r\ncharges against anyone up here in North Elba. “They’re free niggers, far as I’m\r\nconcerned, and that’s how I’ll treat them, so long’s they do the same as you and\r\ngive me a bit of help in performing my duties as a federal officer of the law. You\r\nunderstand what I’m telling you, Mister Brown?”\r\nFather stared up at the man in silence. The horses shifted their weight,\r\nsweating under the sun. “Certainly I understand,” he finally said. “But I will not\r\nhelp you, sir. My son and I, if indeed we did help some poor Negro slaves escape\r\nfrom the evil clutches of some Southern slavemaster—a man who may well have\r\ndeserved to die anyhow, since well-treated slaves rarely risk the rigors of flight—\r\nthen we did so on our own.” The burden of proof lay with the marshal, Father\r\npointed out, and he believed that giving a stranger in a strange land a ride in\r\nyour wagon was not yet illegal in the state of New York.\r\nWell, yes, the marshal agreed. It was a gray area of the law, a person might\r\nsay. Father would benefit everyone concerned, however, himself included, if he\r\nsaw fit to aid the law. The marshal rolled his head slowly on his shoulders, as if\r\nhis neck were stiff and this were a casual conversation. The two deputies kept\r\ntheir right hands open and close to the handles of their revolvers.\r\nFather said, “You don’t know who you’re looking for, except on Mister\r\nWilkinson’s perjured say-so. And I can’t help you, and if I could, I’ll tell you\r\nfrankly, sir, I wouldn’t. Find your Negroes on your own,” he snapped, and he\r\nturned and walked towards the house.\r\n“It could all unravel on you, Brown!” the marshal called after.",
    " “I might bring\r\nWilkinson himself up here, so’s he can identify the two niggers for me, and when\r\nit comes to saving their own dusky skins, who knows what them fellows’ll say\r\nthen?”\r\nFather wheeled and glared at him. “Do as you wish! Bring Satan up from hell,\r\nif you Like, and have him pick a pair of Negroes from the crowd for you. I’ll not\r\nhelp with work like this!”\r\nThe three turned their horses abruptly then and rode out of the yard, and\r\nwithout looking back, they galloped down the road towards the settlement. A\r\nmoment later, when I went inside the house, I found Father already seated, still\r\nshirtless, at his writing table, furiously scratching out a letter.\r\n“Who are you writing to?” I asked him.\r\n“John and Jason.”\r\n“In Springfield? And Ohio?”\r\n“Yes, of course!”\r\n“They may not be there now!’ I said. “They might’ve already left for here.”\r\nBarely a week before, a letter from John had arrived, saying, among other\r\ncheering things, that he and Jason intended soon to come up to North Elba for a\r\nshort visit, to see the place and the family and to settle a few business matters\r\nwith Father that could best be discussed in person.\r\n“All the better. But in case they haven’t, this will bring them promptly.” He\r\nblotted the letter and passed it over to me to read.\r\nCome hither at once, boys, and come armed, for we need to snatch a few poor\r\ncreatures from out of the mouth of Satan before he devours them! A proper show\r\nof Christian force and clear intent to rain fire down upon the heads of these local\r\nmalefactors and hypocrites ought to clarify matters here, leastways enough so\r\nthat we can continue doing the Lord’s work and help bring about the downfall of\r\nslavery by making it too costly to maintain against the combined wills of white\r\nChristians and of the desperate, courageous slaves themselves. Come hither to\r\nNorth Elba now, my sons!",
    " Come and stand with us as true, courageous, righteous\r\nSoldiers of the Lord! Your loving father,\r\nJohn Brown\r\nI pointed out that it might be ten days or two weeks before they received his\r\nsummons, and the whole affair could well have blown over by then. “And\r\nbesides,”I said, “they might’ve already left Springfield to come here anyhow.\r\nWhy bother writing this at all?”\r\nFather looked up at me with an expression that flowed from puzzlement to\r\nslight disgust. “Owen, sometimes I think... ,” he said, then began again. “Owen, I\r\nsometimes believe that you must become a hotter man than you are.” And with a\r\nlittle wave of dismissal, he returned to his letter, signed it, and placed it into an\r\nenvelope and sealed it for mailing.\r\nI stood by the window for a moment and, peering out at the mountains, saw\r\nthat it was clouding up in the west to rain. I felt weary, almost dizzy, from two\r\nsleepless nights and ached in my bones for rest and wanted nothing more than to\r\nsleep for a day and a night. But I knew I could not do that yet. I pulled on a shirt\r\nand trudged from the house, across the yard towards the field, to help the family\r\nbring in the hay. Scythe in hand, I crossed the road, and as I neared the others, I\r\nheard rapid hoofbeats behind me and, turning, saw Father ride out. He was\r\nheaded towards the village to get his letter into the afternoon post to Westport,\r\nwhence it would make its slow way south to Massachusetts, and the sight of the\r\nman, wrapped in haste and single-mindedness and rage, fatigued me now\r\nbeyond all imagining. It nearly repelled me.",
    "\r\nA short ways beyond, bent over in the field, was the rest of my family—my\r\nstepmother and sisters in starched bonnets like white flower-tops and my\r\nbrothers under the shade of their straw hats working with their backs to me and\r\nagainst the wind that riffled across the field of yellow hay, flattening and\r\nsilvering it in the fading afternoon light. They seemed at such peace with the\r\nworld, so at ease with themselves, that I envied them and, momentarily weak\r\nand guilty, my conscience enflamed by Father’s example and his cruel remark,\r\nfelt cut off from them, as if I were a member of a completely different family.\r\nThere followed then a rapid succession of events, one leading swiftly to the next,\r\nand it seemed at the time that there was nothing we or anyone else could do to\r\nstop or deflect them. First, that same evening, when Father returned from\r\nposting his letter, he came all boiling with unusual rage. The family, me\r\nincluded, was at the table, eating supper, when he galloped into the yard on his\r\npoor old tired Morgan horse, strode into the house, and poured out his story in a\r\ntorrent of words, shocking us with the ferocity of his anger and frightening the\r\nyounger children. Sputtering and spitting, he bore us the news that when\r\nMarshal Saunders had earlier interrogated us, he had lied. It was a lie of\r\nomission, but a heinous lie nonetheless, Father declared, for the marshal had not\r\ntold us that he had brought Mr. Wilkinson along with him and that he had kept\r\nthe man hidden down the road a ways from the farm. Loud talk of murder and\r\nlying federal law officers and hypocrisy, of revenge and bloody rebellion, of\r\nlaying about with the jawbone of an ass and chopping off the heads of serpents\r\n—we were used to that from Father.",
    " But here, tonight, in our farmhouse kitchen,\r\nour domestic sanctuary seemed to have been invaded for the first time, and the\r\ncalls to violence were no longer made with regard to some distant or even\r\nimaginary place and time. They were more than metaphorical. Father wanted\r\nblood, real blood, and he wanted it now.\r\nThe Old Man had learned from the folks in Timbuctoo that after having been\r\nrebuked and rebuffed by Father, the marshal and his deputies had gathered up\r\nMr. Wilkinson from his hiding-place, and the four had ridden over to the Negro\r\nsettlement, where the traitorous villain Wilkinson had identified Lyman Epps\r\nand Mr. Fleete as our cohorts. Then, despite Lyman’s and Mr. Fleete’s insistence\r\nthat they knew nothing of the whereabouts of the couple wanted in Virginia for\r\nmurder, the marshal had placed both men under arrest and had marched them\r\noff to Elizabethtown, where, said Father, they were probably, even as he himself\r\nspoke, being placed under lock and key, as if the two had been returned to the\r\nmanacles of slavery.\r\n“This shall not be allowed to stand!” Father bellowed.\r\nSusan Epps was naturally alarmed as to her husband’s fate, and Ruth and Mary\r\nrushed to console her, as did I. Father, however, seemed blinded by his rage, and\r\nignoring the fears of the women and children, he stomped up and down in the\r\nroom, counting weapons and imagining violent confrontations along the trail\r\nbetween North Elba and the Elizabethtown jail, which both he and I knew the\r\nmarshal and his party would not reach until morning or even later, if on their\r\nway they stopped overnight in Keene at Mr. Partridge’s house, as we ourselves\r\nhad when first coming over here back in May.\r\n“We can still catch the culprits, you and I,” he said to me. “Lyman and Mister\r\nFleete are surely afoot, made to walk in chains like captured animals while the\r\nwhite men ride.",
    " They must have passed by here this very afternoon while you\r\nwere all at work in the fields,” he suddenly realized. “Didn’t you see them?” he\r\ndemanded. “Good Lord, didn’t a one of you children notice them on the road?\r\nFour white men astride horses and two black men treated like slaves before your\r\nvery noses, and not a one of you saw it?”\r\nI explained that we had all been hard at work bringing in the hay, that it was\r\nhot and we were way down at the lower end of the field by then, trying to beat\r\nthe rain. It had not rained after all, but had merely threatened to do so all\r\nafternoon long and into the evening. Now we heard distant thunder rumbling in\r\nthe west, and flashes of heat lightning crackled across the darkening sky.\r\n“Bah!” he exclaimed, grabbing down our muskets and checking the powder\r\nand bullets. “What we need are swords” he muttered to himself. “Broadswords!\r\nSo we can sweep down upon them like avenging angels!”\r\nBut as the evening wore on, the Old Man calmed somewhat and seemed to\r\nsettle upon a slightly more rational strategy for obtaining the release of our\r\nfriends, which relieved me. I had not liked much the idea of the two of us riding\r\nout alone in the dark and recklessly falling upon the marshal, his deputies, and\r\nMr. Wilkinson, and probably Partridge, too, with nothing but two small-bore\r\nmuskets and a pair of hand-axes between us. On reflection, Father now believed\r\nthat he might obtain the legal and financial help of Mr. Gerrit Smith, whose\r\ninfluence in these parts was great, and to this end the Old Man commenced to\r\nwrite a set of letters and pleas.",
    " He also proposed to ride over to Elizabethtown\r\ntomorrow morning himself, armed, in case of emergency, and accompanied by\r\nme—there to speak with the local authorities and try to get our friends released\r\non their own recognizance pending a trial, which he firmly believed would never\r\ntake place anyhow.\r\n“This whole thing is a dumbshow,” he now insisted. “A charade. It’s merely an\r\nattempt to intimidate the poor fellows,” he growled. He believed that Marshal\r\nSaunders was only interested in putting a feather in his cap for capturing the\r\nCannons and thus was trying to frighten our friends into betraying the poor\r\ncouple and had no intention of trying them in court. Father was sure that Lyman\r\nand Mr. Fleete had no more knowledge of the Cannons’ present whereabouts\r\nthan we and were as ignorant as we of the Cannons’ true reasons for fleeing their\r\nmaster and the state of Virginia—if indeed it was true that they slew the man in\r\nthe first place. And if they did, so be it. How could we blame them? Father\r\nalmost wished they had slain their master. “Only in an evil and inhuman land,\r\nOwen, is it a crime to slay the man who enslaves you. Remember that,” he said.\r\nWhen morning came and Father and I were preparing to leave for\r\nElizabethtown, who should arrive at our doorstep but dear John and sweet Jason\r\n—my beloved brothers. It was a great reunion for us all. They arrived on\r\nhorseback with the sun rising behind them, spotted first by Salmon, who gave\r\nthe cry that brought us all streaming from the house to greet them.\r\nThey were gentle men, both alike in that way, and loving towards everyone in\r\nthe family, especially towards our stepmother, Mary, and sister Ruth. With\r\nregard to Ruth they were probably no more devoted than I myself, but towards\r\nour stepmother they seemed as a pair to exhibit a greater affection and\r\nprotectiveness than I could ever muster.",
    " This had always confused me\r\nsomewhat, for their loss, when our mother died, had surely been as great as\r\nmine. Yet, apparently, it was not so, or at least for them the loss was not of a\r\nnature that restricted their ability to transfer deep affection and tenderness for\r\nour natural mother across to our stepmother. It sometimes seemed that the loss\r\nof our mother had actually enlarged my elder brothers’ capacity to love her\r\nreplacement, for they were more careful of Mary’s feelings than were her natural\r\nsons even, Watson, Salmon, and Oliver. How strange it is, that brothers and\r\nsisters can share every important childhood experience and yet end up\r\nresponding to those experiences in such dramatically different ways. What\r\nliberates and gives power to one child must often humiliate and weaken another,\r\nuntil it appears that our differences more than our sameness have come to bind\r\nus.\r\nMy elder brothers and I did not greatly resemble each other in physical ways,\r\neither, although it was clear to most people that we were blood kin. Even at that\r\nyoung age, in his late twenties, John was a large and thick-bodied fellow, strong\r\nand muscular and athletic-looking, but in the manner of a budding banker,\r\nperhaps, or a politician. He had a high and noble forehead, symmetrical features,\r\nlong, soft, dark brown hair that he combed straight back over his collar, giving\r\nhim the look of a scholar, which, in a manner of speaking, he was, for he had\r\nlearned accounting and was at that time deeply engaged in the study of several\r\nof the newer sciences, such as phrenology and hypnotism. His voice was deep\r\nand authoritative, and he had a great, loose laugh, which I had imitated when I\r\nwas a boy but now merely admired.",
    "\r\nJason was a shorter man than John, about the same height as Father, and\r\nmore slender than I with my woodsman’s build, but although he gave the\r\nappearance of delicacy, he was in fact extremely hardy and tough, a gristly man\r\nwho moved in a slow, measured way that suggested deep thought, for his brow\r\nwas characteristically as furrowed as a field in May, and his lips he kept pursed,\r\nlike a man auditioning his words in silence before speaking them. In another\r\nage, or if he had been born to high estate and privilege, Jason might have been a\r\nphilosopher or poet, a man like Mr. Emerson of Concord, perhaps, whose life,\r\nwhose every act, was determined by the shape and substance of his thought.\r\nJason was a man of sweet reasoning, his gentleness driven not by sentiment so\r\nmuch as by the innocence of logic. Unlike John, he was a man whom no one\r\nwould follow into battle; but then, unlike John, he had no desire to lead. By the\r\nsame token, he was equally disinclined to follow any man, even Father. A poor\r\nsoldier was Jason, he who would be neither private nor general.\r\nYet, fully as much as John and all our younger brothers, and as much as I at\r\nmy best, Jason was loyal to Father and to the rest of the family. He was not in\r\nthe slightest selfish; he was merely one who thought freely for himself. Contrary\r\nto how he has sometimes been portrayed in the various accounts of our family,\r\nJason was a man of great courage, too, and until the end, he stood alongside us;\r\nand when, before we went into Virginia, he left our side, he did so out of deep\r\nconviction, not cowardice or self-interest. I always admired, rather than\r\ncriticized, Jason for his willingness to resist Father’s imperative.\r\nFather had a power over us that seemed almost to emanate from his very\r\nbody, as if he were more of a purely male person than we.",
    " While I have in my\r\nlifetime met a few other such men, who, like Father, seemed to be more\r\nmasculine than the general run of men, as a rule they were brutal and stupid,\r\nwhich he surely was not. Like him, their beards were coarser, the hair on their\r\nhands, arms, and chests denser, their musculature and their bones tougher,\r\nheavier, more massy, than those of other men. They smelled more male-like than\r\nthe rest of us. Even bathed and suited up for church, they, like Father, gave off\r\nthe aroma of well-oiled saddle leather. None of those men, however, was as\r\nmorally sensitive and intelligent as the Old Man, traits that made his masculinity\r\nso much more formidable than theirs. In ancient times, figures like Father,\r\ncharacterized in their appearance and manner by an excess of masculinity, were\r\nprobably singled out in youth and made chieftain, clan leader, warlord. It was\r\ndifficult not to bow before such a man.\r\nSometimes I thought this was how most women felt in the presence of men\r\ngenerally—like a small, hairless child, soft and vulnerable, before the large,\r\nhairy, tough, and impervious adult. It’s what we mean, perhaps, by “womanish.”\r\nMen like Father seem to evoke in all of us, male as well as female, long-\r\nabandoned, childlike responses which make us malleable to their wishes and\r\nwill. Thus, when Father said, “Jump!” even though I was twenty-four, then\r\nthirty, then thirty-four years old, I jumped. I always jumped.\r\nI am not ashamed of that, however. For, truth to tell, it was his gentleness, not\r\nhis huge, male ferocity, that gathered us in and kept us there. We came to him\r\nwillingly, not out of fear. His pervasive gentleness was like a sweet liquor to us,\r\nan intoxicant that left us narcotized, inducing in us a morbid susceptibility to his\r\nwill.",
    " My most vivid memories of this most manly of men are of his face\r\nstreaming with tears after he had struggled vainly for long days and nights to\r\nsave his dying child. I think of his holding a freezing lamb against his naked\r\nchest under his shirt and coat, warming the creature with his own body, until\r\nthe tiny lamb came slowly back to life and the Old Man could place it down\r\nbeside its mother and step away and fairly laugh aloud with the pleasure of\r\nseeing it begin to nurse again. I remember Father tending to his wife and to each\r\nof his children when we were sick, hovering over us like a perfect physician,\r\nwhen he himself was ill and barely able to stand, tucking blankets around our\r\nshivering bodies, tending the fire, heating milk, manufacturing and\r\nadministering remedies and medicinal specifics, long past exhaustion, until one\r\nor the other of us would begin at last to recover and was finally well enough to\r\nspell him, and then and only then would he allow himself to be treated. And\r\nthough we often laughed and behind his back mocked Father for his long-\r\nwindedness and certain other peculiarities of speech when he was trying to teach\r\nus a new skill—for he was one of those who teach as much by verbal instruction\r\nand repetition as example—withal, he was the most patient and tender teacher\r\nany of us ever had, who suffered our ignorance and ineptitude gladly, and never\r\nseemed to forget how mysterious and peculiar the world looked to a child and\r\nhow even the simplest household or barnyard tasks seemed at first forbidding\r\nand complex.",
    "\r\nNo, it was the remarkable, perhaps unique, combination of his extreme\r\nmasculinity and his unabashedly feminine tenderness that brought us willingly\r\nunder his control and kept us there, so that, even when one or two or three of us\r\nseemed to wander off from his teachings and desires—as in the matter of\r\nreligion, or, later, when he determined to go down into Virginia—none of us\r\never departed from him altogether. We merely on those occasions took a few\r\ncautious steps to his right or left side and tried to aid him in his work from that\r\nposition, instead of from a position directly behind him. Even when John\r\nmarried Wealthy Hotchkiss and Jason married Ellen Sherbondy, and they moved\r\nout of the family household and set up on their own, they did it in ways that\r\nmerely established new orbits that allowed them to function as satellites circling\r\nFather, like moons around a planet, and thus they were held as powerfully as\r\nbefore by his larger orbit, while he himself circled the sun. At an age when most\r\nmen our age were running off to see the elephant, as we called it then—heading\r\nout to search for gold in California, staking out land in the further reaches of the\r\nWestern Reserve, or following the crowds of bright, ambitious men and boys to\r\nNew York and Washington—I and my brothers kept ourselves bound to our\r\nfather’s destiny.\r\nWith the sudden arrival at the farm of John and Jason, a day that turned out\r\nto be tumultuous and, ultimately, tragic began as a celebration of familial\r\nwarmth and union. Over breakfast, Father apprised his elder sons of the ongoing\r\nsituation with regard to the Underground Railroad, Marshal Saunders’s pursuit\r\nof the Cannons, Mr. Wilkinson’s betrayal of Lyman Epps and Mr. Fleete, and\r\ntheir recent arrest and removal to the Elizabeth town jail.",
    " And when he informed\r\nthem of his intention to ride over to Elizabethtown with me for the purpose of\r\narranging the release of the Negro men—“Even if it must be done at gunpoint,”\r\nhe said—John and Jason naturally chose to accompany and support us.\r\nOnce again, it fell to me to drive the wagon, while Father and my elder\r\nbrothers rode on horseback. “We’ll need the wagon to carry our friends back\r\nhome,” Father said, and, of course, I agreed, although Father or one of the others\r\ncould have driven it as well as I. Mary and Ruth and Susan Epps packed two\r\ndays’ food for us, and the entire family stood by the door and waved cheerfully,\r\nas if we were setting out on a deer hunt, and we rode uphill back along the\r\nCascade Road, east towards Keene and Elizabethtown.\r\nWe had not planned to stop in Keene, which we reached by noon, but as we\r\npassed by the rundown farm owned by Mr. Partridge, Father suddenly\r\ndetermined to pull up. “I believe I have some business with that man,” he grimly\r\nannounced, and pulled into the yard and dismounted. We followed, but did not\r\nget down from our horses, as he crossed the yard, strode across the porch, and\r\nrapped loudly on the door. There was a single, saddled horse at the porch rail, a\r\nbay that I thought I recognized but could not be sure until the door swung open\r\nand I saw Mr. Partridge’s long, dark, gloomy face and behind him glimpsed the\r\ngrizzled face of the slave-catcher Mr. Billingsly.\r\nBillingsly darted out of our line of sight into the darkness of the room, but he\r\nsurely knew that I and probably Father had spotted him when the door opened.\r\nThis was a dangerous situation, and I jumped down from the wagon and signaled\r\nto John and Jason, who dismounted and joined me at the porch steps.\r\n“What do you want here, Brown?” Mr.",
    " Partridge said, his voice a bit shaky\r\nwith fear, as the three of us came to stand behind Father, each with a musket in\r\nhand. Father, too, had his gun with him, slung under his right arm.\r\n“I’ve come to redeem my clock,” Father announced. He reached down into his\r\nleft pocket and drew out some coins, which he held in front of him, until Mr.\r\nPartridge unthinkingly extended his own palm. Father let the coins trickle into\r\nthe other man’s hand and said, “That, sir, is the cost of our food and lodging for\r\none night, which you established back in May. You may count it, and then you\r\nwill hand over my clock.”\r\n“You’re crazy, Brown,” he said, and he shoved the coins back at Father,\r\ngroping at the Old Man’s snuff-colored frock coat until he found a loosely open\r\npocket and dropped them in, whereupon he moved to shut the door in Father’s\r\nface. Father kicked the door back hard and shoved Mr. Partridge aside, and there\r\nstood revealed the slave-catcher Billingsly, who had drawn both his pistols.\r\nEverything that followed happened in less than two seconds. I saw Mr.\r\nPartridge’s dough-faced wife a ways behind Billingsly, her hands over her\r\nmouth, and beyond her was the old woman, her mother, calmly seated by the\r\nrear window, knitting, as if she were alone in the house. Mr. Partridge, his\r\nbearded face taut and drained white with fear, turned and grabbed Great-\r\nGrandfather’s clock from the fireplace mantel and extended it towards Father, a\r\nlast-chance peace offering. At that instant, Billingsly fired one of his pistols,\r\nmissing Father, who stood directly before him, missing everyone, although we\r\ndid not know it yet, and simultaneously several of us fired our rifles, a reckless,\r\nwild thing to do at such close range with so many innocent people close by, but\r\nwe were lucky, for no one was struck—except for the one man who deserved it,\r\nBillingsly the slave-catcher.",
    " He howled in pain and went down, rolling on the\r\nfloor and clutching at his thigh, where blood spurted crimson onto the rug.\r\nI had fired my gun, I know that, and I later learned that John had fired his, but\r\nI do not know which of us shot Billingsly. Whichever, John or me, it was the first\r\ntime one of us Browns had shot a man. I myself had meant not to hit anyone,\r\nintending merely to fire into the ceiling over everyone’s head, hoping, I suppose,\r\nto control the situation by striking terror into Billingsly, not a bullet. John later\r\nsaid that he had definitely meant to shoot the man dead but had not a clear shot,\r\nso merely had tried not to hit anyone else, especially the women.\r\nWho knew, then, which of us had shot him, and did it matter? One of John\r\nBrown’s sons had done the bloody deed, and the day would continue that way,\r\nwith John Brown and his sons wreaking havoc and spilling blood in the\r\nAdirondack mountain villages of New York. Whatever one of us did, we all did.\r\nThe man Billingsly was down, and his pistols were scattered across the floor.\r\nThere was a loud battery of shouts, bellows, commands, and, from at least one of\r\nthe women, high-pitched screams, and I do not know if I or my brothers or Mr.\r\nPartridge or even Billingsly was amongst the hounds who gave cry, although one\r\nof us Browns shouted, “He’s down! He’s down!” And another yelled at Partridge,\r\n“Don’t make a move, mister, or I swear it, I’ll kill you at once!” Several of us\r\nwere calling to the rest, “Are you hit? Are you hit?” And, “No! Missed me! The\r\ncoward missed me!” And, “Hold your fire! Hold your fire now!”\r\nOnly Father remained calm. He waited for silence, and when it came, the Old\r\nMan, as cool and unruffled as a frozen lake, took the clock out of Mr. Partridge’s\r\nhands.",
    " Then he looked down at the bleeding slave-catcher, who squirmed and\r\nwrithed on the floor in pain, and said in a clear, steady voice, “Mister Billingsly,\r\nthis is the second time that you are lucky that we Browns have not killed you. I\r\nadvise you, sir, to consider another line of business than hunting down escaped\r\nslaves.”\r\nHe turned, closed the door behind him, and placed the clock into the front of\r\nthe wagon, below the driver’s bench. Then the Old Man and John and Jason\r\nmounted their horses. I jumped up into the wagon, and we rode quickly off,\r\naway from the valley, into the mountains and over the ridge to Elizabethtown,\r\nwhere, at around four o’clock in the afternoon, we drew up before the stately\r\nbrick courthouse.\r\nThe jail was behind and belowstairs, and we walked directly there. I did not\r\nknow Father’s plan, or if he actually had one, beyond somehow convincing the\r\nElizabethtown jailer to release Mr. Fleete and Lyman into our custody, which did\r\nnot to me seem likely. But Father was adept at improvisation, so it was perhaps\r\nfortuitous, when we four Browns marched into the jail, armed and passably\r\ndangerous-looking, our faces flushed and hearts still beating rapidly from the\r\nshooting back in Keene, that we ran face-first into Mr. Wilkinson of Tahawus. He\r\nlooked surprised and frightened to see us, naturally. He appeared to have just\r\ncome in from a hard ride himself.\r\n“Mister Wilkinson” Father said, “tell me your business here.”\r\nThe man backed off and turned to the jailer, a small, mustachioed man seated\r\nbehind a cluttered desk, putting papers away. “This here’s John Brown!”\r\nWilkinson exclaimed to the jailer, who did not appear to care. “He’s come to\r\nbreak the niggers out of jail!”\r\nAt once, Father placed the mouth of the barrel of his musket next to the ear of\r\nMr. Wilkinson. “You’re right about that;’ he said.",
    " “Jailer, you can march back to\r\nthe cells with my sons here and uncage the two colored men and bring them\r\nforward, if you will be so kind. Otherwise, I will blow this man’s brains out.”\r\nMr. Wilkinson whimpered and said that he had nothing to do with their being\r\njailed, that it was all the fault of Marshal Saunders.\r\n“Then what are you here for?”\r\n“I came for my own business,”he said.\r\n“You lie, Wilkinson. Jailer,” Father said, “tell me this maris business here.\r\nNow!” He cocked the hammer of his gun. Mr. Wilkinson shut his eyes tightly, as\r\nif he expected to hear the gun go off that instant.\r\nSlowly, carefully, the jailer stood. John, Jason, and I all had our guns trained\r\non him. “Wal, he come in to identify the niggers back there and sign some\r\npapers to it. Marshal said he was to do that. Hey, listen, Mister Brown,” he said,\r\n“I don’t know nothin’ about these here niggers. You can do with them whatever\r\nthe hell you want.”\r\n“Has Mister Wilkinson so sworn, that the men you have locked up for the\r\nmarshal are indeed the fellows he says they are? Because I’m here to tell you\r\nthey are not,” Father said.\r\n“Wal, no, not yet he ain’t. They’s just a couple of coloreds, far’s I’m concerned,\r\nand I’m holdin’ ’em for the marshal, like he asked, till he comes back from Port\r\nKent.”\r\n“With no arrest warrant.”\r\n“Wal... yes, sir. Yes. That’s so.”\r\nGrabbing Mr. Wilkinson by his shirt collar, Father drew him to the steel door\r\nthat led to the cells and said to the jailer, “Come along, and bring your keys.\r\nMister Wilkinson here is going to tell you that the men you have locked up are\r\nnot the men the marshal is seeking.”\r\n“Wal, sir, y’ know I can’t release them without the marshal’s say-so,” the man\r\nsaid, although he was already unlocking the door to the jail.\r\n“You will do as I say,”said Father.",
    "\r\n“Yes, sir, I b’lieve I will,” he said, and he swung open the door, and we all\r\nwalked into the cell block and went straightway back to where Mr. Fleete and\r\nLyman awaited us. They both grinned broadly when they saw us and came to\r\nthe front of their shared cell and grasped the bars, watching as the jailer\r\nunlocked the cell door and swung it wide.\r\n“Mister Brown, we are mightly relieved to see you,” said Mr. Fleete. “That\r\nthere fellow, he’s the one told the marshal we run the Cannons off to Canada,”\r\nsaid Lyman, pointing sternly at Mr. Wilkinson. “They come up on us over in\r\nTimbuctoo yesterday evening. Said we knew where the Cannons was hiding.\r\nSaid they killed their master down in Virginia. We don’t know nothing about\r\nthat, now, do we, Mister Brown?”\r\n“No, Lyman, we don’t,”said Father.\r\n“This ain’t legal, you know” the jailer said to Father, as we all marched back\r\nout to his office. Father still held Mr. Wilkinson by his shirt collar and had his\r\ngun tight against the man’s ear.\r\n“Just don’t try to stop us,” said Father, “and no harm will come to either of\r\nyou. We’ll all worry about what’s legal and what isn’t later on. Right now,\r\nhowever, these men have not been charged and therefore are free.” He let go of\r\nMr. Wilkinson and lowered his gun, and we did like wise with ours and, with\r\nMr. Fleete and Lyman in the lead, made to leave the jader’s office. John was the\r\nlast to depart from the building, and when he turned to draw the door closed\r\nbehind him, as he told us later, he saw the jailer extract a handgun from his\r\ndesk, and he shot the man. It happened so quickly and unexpectedly that we\r\nbarely knew of it, except for the loud gunshot and the sulphurous smell of the\r\npowder, for we were already outside and crossing the grass towards the horses\r\nand wagon.\r\n“Go!” John shouted, and we ran. “He pulled a gun!",
    "”\r\nI leapt onto the wagon seat and grabbed the reins, and Mr. Fleete and Lyman,\r\ntheir faces filled with fear, jumped into the back. Father, Jason, and John\r\nmounted their horses, and we all broke for the road out of town. When the\r\nwagon passed the open door of the jail, with the others on horseback racing on\r\nahead, I looked to my side and saw the jailer come to the door. He had been\r\nwounded in his left arm, but he held a revolver in his right, and he aimed\r\ncarefully and fired once, and then we were gone, the horses pounding up the\r\nroad, heading north out of town—towards the pass to Ausable Forks this time,\r\ninstead of back the way we had come, through Keene, where we had shot\r\nBillingsly.\r\nIt was not until we had run nearly a mile that I took it into my head to check\r\nmy passengers, and when I glanced back I saw with dismay that Mr. Fleete had\r\nbeen shot in the chest. Lyman sat ashen-faced and expressionless beside him,\r\nlooking out at the passing scenery as if he were alone. Father and the others\r\nwere still a ways ahead of us, too far to call, and so I drove on. Shortly, when we\r\nhad gotten several miles out of town, I drew the wagon up under a tall spruce\r\ntree beside the road at the crest of a short hill. I turned in the seat and stepped\r\ninto the back, where Mr. Fleete lay.\r\nAs if explaining a living man’s absence, not a dead man’s presence, Lyman\r\nsaid, “Ol’ Elden Fleete, he’s gone back to Africa.”\r\n“Oh, Lord!” I cried. “What have we done? What have we done, Lyman?”\r\n“It ain’t we that killed him, Owen.”\r\nThen Father and John and Jason appeared on horseback beside the wagon,\r\nand they looked down and saw what had happened and grew dark with anger\r\nand sorrow. Especially Father. “Bring him on back to Timbuctoo, where he can\r\nbe dressed out for a proper burial. I only wish it were the slave-catcher who was\r\ndead,” he said, “not the slave.",
    "”\r\n“Mister Fleete was not a slave, Father” I said.\r\n“We know that, Owen. We know it. But those other fellows don’t.” He clucked\r\nto his horse, and we all fell into a somber line and made our slow way back\r\ndown through Wilmington Notch to North Elba.\r\nThere was a terrible sadness amongst all the Negroes when we delivered Mr.\r\nFleete’s body over to them, but no indications of surprise. For them, I suppose,\r\nthe astonishing thing was that one of them had managed to live so long without\r\nhaving run from the world and hid from it in a hole. That was something about\r\nNegroes which I found mystifying in those days—that they constantly expected\r\ndeath and yet did not anticipate it. Later, of course, I came to the same\r\nviewpoint myself.\r\nBut the consequences of our rash acts were not as dire as I, for one, expected,\r\nalthough they were, indeed, catastrophic for the Negro community in general.\r\nWe had inflicted a serious wound on the slave-catcher (not a mortal one, it\r\nseemed), and that was probably a positive good. Although it seemed to me that\r\nthere had been more than enough blood spilt. On the way back from Elizabeth\r\ntown, John confided that he hoped Billingsly would come looking for revenge,\r\nso we could kill him properly. Two white men wounded for one black man dead:\r\nthat was the trade-off. Not quite fair, I thought, but closer to even than most of\r\nthese exchanges allowed. And we had surely scared our Keene neighbor Mr.\r\nPartridge straight back to his deer-hunting ways, stifling any rising ambitions he\r\nmay have held for assisting slave-catchers and sharing in the rewards of that\r\nheinous activity. The unfortunate jailer in Elizabethtown, whose name I never\r\nlearned, was one of those who, in Father’s phrase, were merely doing their duty,\r\nand though he had paid dearly for it, he would have a scar to show and a tale to\r\ntell for the rest of his days.",
    " He would be able to say that he had been one of the\r\nfirst innocent victims of the Browns’ nigger madness. Mr. Wilkinson, our one-\r\ntime ally, had beat his retreat back to Tahawus, where he would continue to\r\ndrive his Irish miners, but with no further pretensions to providing aid and\r\nsuccor to Negroes, and that was actually in the interests of Negroes and those of\r\nus who might have otherwise allied ourselves with him. It’s always useful to\r\nknow your enemy and to have him know you, as Father was fond of saying.\r\nDespite their astonishment and sadness on learning of the death of Mr. Fleete,\r\nour family was overjoyed, of course, to see us return to the farm that night\r\nuninjured, and Susan wept with relief at the sight of her husband freed from jail.\r\nHowever, their anxiety, as we learned on our arrival home, had been greatly\r\nincreased that afternoon by a piece of intelligence they had received in our\r\nabsence from Captain Keifer. He had sent his eldest son down to North Elba on\r\nhorseback to warn us of what we already knew, that Marshal Saunders had come\r\nlooking for the Cannons in Port Kent, and to inform us of what we had not even\r\nguessed—that in truth, as the marshal had claimed, Captain Keifer had not\r\ntransported the Negro couple to Canada after all. Further, the two had been\r\nsurprised in the kitchen of the Quaker’s home by the marshal and his deputies,\r\nand the man had promptly arrested the couple and was now transporting them\r\nsouth to Albany, whence they would be returned to Richmond, Virginia, there to\r\nstand trial for the brutal slaying of their master.\r\n“What! How could that be?” Father demanded. “He deceived us, then! The\r\nQuaker lied! Good Lord, is there no one on this earth we can trust?”\r\nPatiently, Mary related to him what the boy had told her.",
    " His father’s boat had\r\nbeen forced back a few miles north of Plattsburgh by a sudden, dangerous turn\r\nin the weather, and by the time Captain Keifer made a second attempt to take\r\nthem into Canada, his Underground Railroad operatives on the further side of\r\nthe border had been notified by Canadian authorities that the couple was wanted\r\nin the United States, not for fleeing slavery, for which there were at that time no\r\nfederal warrants, but for crossing state lines in flight from arrest for murder, and\r\nas a result they had refused to accept them. Not knowing what else to do with\r\nthe couple, Captain Keifer had brought them into his own home in Port Kent and\r\nhad attempted to hide and protect them there until such time as he could\r\narrange to move them into Canada by some other means. Most of the villagers in\r\nPort Kent were soon aware of the presence of the Negro couple and did not\r\nobject, and consequently Captain Keifer had grown careless as to their easy\r\ncoming and going about the place. Thus it was not difficult for the marshal and\r\nhis deputies to take them by surprise.\r\n“Surely”‘ Mary said, “the poor man is desolated by this turn of events. He\r\nasked his son to beg you for your understanding and forgiveness, Mister Brown,”\r\nshe said, addressing him as she always did—although in his absence she, like the\r\nrest of us, generally referred to him as Father or the Old Man. “The boy himself\r\nwas mighty agitated and seemed burdened by guilt. Poor lad, all full of his thees\r\nand thous.” She had comforted him as much as she could and sent him back with\r\nassurances to Captain Keifer that Father would bear him no ill will and would\r\nnot judge him for this calamity. After all, Captain Keifer had more to fear now\r\nfrom the law than did any of us, she pointed out. “He has been harboring people\r\nwho he knew were accused murderers, not just escaped slaves.",
    "”\r\nFather sat heavily down at the table and sighed. I sensed that he was giving\r\nsomething up. John and Jason and I glanced at one another nervously. What\r\nnow? The ride from Father’s peaks to his valleys was often a rough one, and we\r\nwere still perched on the heights of our day’s adventure, trying to sort out the\r\nmeanings of our bloody encounters and the death of Mr. Fleete, hoping to be\r\nable to use them to energize us and entitle us to further brave acts. We were\r\nyoung men, after all, armed, freshly tested in battle, and puffed up with\r\nrighteous wrath, and it did not take much in those days to set our hearts to\r\npounding. Even Jason. We did not want Father to abandon us now and, as was\r\nhis wont at times like this, to slump down into a slough of despond, where we\r\nwould doubtless have to follow.\r\n“Let me have one of my babies,” Father said in a low voice. “Annie or Sarah.\r\nLet me have Sarah. Bring me little Sarie, will you, Ruth?” Suddenly, the Old Man\r\nlooked very tired—bone-weary and aged.\r\nRuth went obediently to the sleeping loft to fetch the child. Father said,\r\n“Everything seems to have come undone, doesn’t it, children? Our neighbors\r\nhave abandoned us. Men have been shot. Blood spilt. And a beloved, courageous\r\nfriend has been shot dead. And now those whom we would assist in their plight\r\nhave been captured by the enemy and taken off south to be hung, or worse. Oh, I\r\ncan barely think of it!”\r\nNo one answered. The younger boys, Watson, Salmon, and Oliver, lounged at\r\nthe door to the further room, waiting eagerly for the bloody details, who shot\r\nwhom and where, which they knew would come later, when we elder sons went\r\nupstairs to bed and were freed by the absence of our parents to brag to one\r\nanother. Mary silently placed food down on the table, and Lyman, John, Jason,\r\nand I all drew up our stools and set to eating.",
    " In a moment, Ruth returned\r\ncarrying the sleepy-eyed Sarah, and deposited the child on Father’s lap. He\r\nsmiled wanly down into her puffy face, and when she rose to wakefulness,\r\nrecognized him, and grinned, he brightened somewhat and began to rock her\r\nslowly in his arms.\r\n“John says I must return to Springfield,” he said to us. In a calm, low voice, he\r\nexplained that he was needed there to settle some painful arguments and tangled\r\ndisputes between the woolen buyers and the sheep farmers in Ohio and our main\r\nsupport, Mr. Perkins—old claims and counter-claims that John thought would be\r\nmore easily resolved if Father was there to face down these nettlesome people in\r\nperson. It had seemed a bad idea to Father at first. “Now... now I don’t know,\r\nmaybe he’s right. I had hoped to be needed more here, however, than in\r\nSpringfield,” he said, and he sighed heavily again. “I think our Negro friends\r\nacross the valley in Timbuctoo, like our white friends here in North Elba, will no\r\nlonger want to work with us. What think you, Lyman?”\r\nLyman looked up from his plate of ham and corn bread and baked beans,\r\nchewed silently for a moment, and finally said, “Mister Brown, I can’t speak for\r\nthem other folks. Just for me and my wife here. And we’re going to do whatever\r\nyou decide you need us for. You and your boys, you got me out of that jail\r\ntoday. And if it was me instead of poor ol’ Elden that got killed, and he was the\r\none sitting here tonight eating supper, I know he’d be telling you the same thing.\r\nBut them other folks over at Timbuctoo, they’re probably going to want to lay\r\nlow for a spell. Sort of playing possum, you know. They got to, Mister Brown.\r\nYou can understand that.”\r\n“Playing possum, eh? But not you and Susan?”\r\n“No, no, we’re colored folks, too, Mister Brown. For sure. But we’re living here\r\nnow in this house.",
    " We’re not settled with them across the valley in Timbuctoo no\r\nmore. That’s why we’ve got to take more consideration of what you people do\r\nthan they do over there. It’s like we got this here debt that we owe to you and\r\nthe family, Mister Brown. And we want to be paying it off” He looked across the\r\nroom at his wife as if for confirmation, and she nodded, and he went back to\r\neating.\r\n“All right, then,” Father said. “It’s settled.”\r\n“What is?” said I, warm corn bread and butter like soft, crumbled gold in my\r\nmouth.\r\n“We’ll go down to Springfield with John and Jason.”\r\n“We?”\r\nFather shot me a hard look. “You and I. Isn’t that what, not so long ago, you\r\nwere begging for, Owen? I need you there, for a month at least, while Jason\r\nreturns to Ohio and sets things right for us out west and sees to his wife and\r\npoor Fred, who have been making do on their own these months. Taking care of\r\nFred is no simple matter, as you know. The good woman probably did not\r\nbargain for that when she agreed to marry Jason.”\r\n“Ellen loves Fred, Father,” Jason said. “Believe me, he’s no burden to her. She\r\nhas no fear of him, even when he goes off on one of his spells.”\r\n“Yes, well, even so, she needs you, son. And I need you there, too, to make\r\nwhat payments we can for the unsold fleeces and to explain our delay to the\r\nrest.”\r\nAs fast as it could be said, then, it had been decided. Father, John, and I would\r\nreturn to Springfield, Jason would head back to Ohio, and Lyman and Susan\r\nEpps would stay on at the farm with the remainder of the family, tending to the\r\nharvest and setting the farm up properly for winter. Lyman had replaced me, as I\r\nhad replaced Jason. And there was more.",
    " Father wished to travel to England, he\r\nsaid, where, according to John, the price for wool was now up to seventy dollars\r\nper hundredweight, nearly twice what Brown & Perkins was getting for it in\r\nSpringfield. He would go there and attempt to convince the British to buy\r\nAmerican wool for the first time. By setting the British buyers off against the\r\nAmerican, he might thereby break the monopoly that was crippling the\r\nproducers and driving Father and Mr. Perkins deeper and deeper into debt as\r\nthey purchased the wool and held it in the Springfield warehouse, waiting for\r\nthe prices to rise.\r\nBut England? To travel across the sea and attempt to penetrate a market and\r\ndeal with men we knew nothing about? That seemed foolish to me.\r\nNot to Father. He would empty the warehouse and sail over with it. The tariffs\r\nwere down. American fleeces could compete with the best in the world now, he\r\ninsisted. John Bull had only to see it before his eyes and have a knowing man\r\nlike Father explain to him the fine conditions under which those fleeces had\r\nbeen grown and make the necessary guarantees for future delivery, and the\r\nfellow would snap it up. Everyone knew that our free Ohio and Pennsylvania\r\nsheepmen could out-produce the poor, beaten-down Scots and Irish, once the\r\nmarket was opened to them. The only reason no one had done it before this was\r\nthat the individual sheepman was incapable of delivering the required quantity\r\nof wool, and the devious American buyers had colluded and done everything\r\nthey could to discourage and sabotage cooperatives like ours. “This is the\r\nsolution!” he exclaimed, happy now, excited again, sailing before a fresh breeze,\r\nwell out of his doldrums of a few minutes earlier.\r\nIt was almost too much to keep up with, these switches and turns, descents\r\nand ascents of feeling and intention.",
    " Jason was happy enough, and looked it,\r\npursing his lips in an anticipatory smile of returning to the arms of his bride and\r\nthe comfort of their home in Ohio. And John was well-pleased, for he had come\r\nto feel like a proper businessman down there in Springfield and had moved into\r\nmore or less permanent quarters with his wife, Wealthy. And Lyman could not\r\nhave been in the slightest discouraged by the prospect of becoming foreman of\r\nthe farm, with his wife, Susan, with Mary and Ruth and a hard-working brood of\r\nboys and girls to help him.\r\nI wondered how Mary regarded the Old Man’s decision: relief, I supposed, for\r\nhis decision to call off the war against slavery for a spell but dread and anxiety\r\nas well, for his forthcoming absence from her side as autumn and winter came\r\non.\r\nBut the one, perhaps the only one, who felt deflated by these new plans,\r\nsurely, was I, Owen Brown, he who barely three months before had wanted\r\nnothing so much as to return from the wilderness of these mountains to the\r\nbustling river town of Springfield. Something had altered my feelings in those\r\nintervening months. The work with Father and the others on the Underground\r\nRailroad, to be sure, those excitements and risks and the sense of being engaged\r\nwholly in a moral enterprise—they had changed me. But something more lasting\r\nthan that had eliminated my earlier longing to leave this place, a thing that had\r\ngrown out of our life as a family settled on a farm in these mountains.\r\nFor as long as I could remember, we had as a family been unified and\r\nempowered by the single great Idea.",
    " But despite that, or perhaps because of it,\r\nwe had been fragmented and split off from one another—with Father charging\r\nabout the countryside and traveling back and forth on his various missions; with\r\nstrangers black and white coming into our household and departing as quickly as\r\nwe became familiar with them; with half a household here and another half\r\nthere; with plans and fantasies simultaneously multiplying and disintegrating, as\r\ncircumstances shifted subtly or got dramatically altered by forces invisible and\r\nbeyond our control; with the very shape and number of our family constantly\r\nchanging from one season to the next, as a new child was born every year, year\r\nafter year, 1834, ’35, ’36, ’37, all the way to ’48, and the terrible, sad deaths of\r\nchildren coming between those births, until we barely knew the names, birth\r\ndates, and death dates of our brothers and sisters. For every new child that\r\narrived, there seemed to be one recently departed, due to the ague, to dysentery,\r\nto consumption, to calamitous accidental scalding, from the first Fred, back\r\nwhen I was but six years old, to the first Sarah, and Charles, Peter, and Austin,\r\nwho all went in that horrific winter of ’43, to little Amelia in ’46, and most\r\nrecently, in Springfield, the baby Ellen. Now, after all that, there had come a\r\nsmall but significant measure of stability here among these Negro and white\r\nfarmers in these mountains, and for the first time in my life I felt I stood at the\r\ncenter of things.\r\nI had not expected that. I had not in fact known that such a feeling was even\r\npossible or that, once experienced, it would seem, not merely desireable, but\r\nnecessary. But it was here in North Elba and nowhere else that the whirl of the\r\none great Idea seemed for me to slow and even to cease hurtling me from one\r\nplace and set of feelings and loyalties to another.",
    " It was here that I felt like a\r\nnormal son and brother in a normal family, farming our rough acres of northern\r\nland, tending our livestock, and aiding our neighbors. I had even begun to\r\nimagine, on seeing my sister Ruth grow attracted to Henry Thompson, my own\r\npossibilities for finding a wife here, building a house, raising my own herd of\r\nsheep, fathering my own children. And, alongside my Negro and white neighbors\r\nalike, continuing to do my bit of the Lord’s and Father’s work.\r\nFor the Old Man, of course, this was not enough. It was not nearly enough; it\r\nwas in fact a sin, to be making a home and in addition doing merely our bit of\r\nthe Lord’s work. We had to be doing all of it; and all our work had to be the\r\nLord’s. Making a home had to be incidental. Or else we were doing Satan’s work.\r\nThus we Browns were once again shifting our mode of contention against\r\nthose who would oppose us, and shifting our base of operations as well. We\r\nwould head south to Springfield and thence to London, England, from where,\r\nFather said, we might well briefly cross over to the Continent and there make an\r\non-site study of Napoleon’s military campaigns in the Lowlands. Upon the sale of\r\nour wool, we would return freed at last of debt, so as to devote ourselves\r\ncompletely, once and for all, to the proper business of waging war against\r\nslavery.\r\n“Then shall all the world see the fruits of our discipline, of our principled\r\nsavagery, and of our strategic intelligence,” Father declared to us that last night\r\nin North Elba. Then might the war properly commence. This valley would be our\r\nbase camp, our headquarters, as we moved down the Appalachians.",
    " Modeling\r\nour tactics and our principles on the tactics and principles that brought about\r\nthe great achievements of Toussaint, Spartacus, and Nat Turner, we would\r\nliberate the South—plantation by plantation, town by town, county by county,\r\nstate by state—until we had at last broken the back of the beast.\r\nSo, yes, he had his plan, even then. And little by little he had made it known\r\nto us. He had maps and texts to support his theories, and he would draw them\r\nout in the evenings to illustrate them to us and demonstrate their feasibility.\r\nAlso, he was no doubt practicing for the time when he would have to place his\r\nplan before the gaze of more skeptical audiences than his wife and children and\r\nthe Negro members of his household, audiences made up of people like\r\nFrederick Douglass and Gerrit Smith, men whose support he personally would\r\ndepend upon and whose support his plan was in fact premised on.\r\nTo bed, then: the child Sarah, asleep on Father’s lap, carried to her bed by\r\nsister Ruth; the lads Watson, Salmon, and Oliver grumpily climbing to the loft, to\r\nawait the arrival of their elder brothers. And we did follow along shortly after,\r\nwith Lyman Epps, who surely would have preferred to be sleeping in a private\r\nchamber in his own bed with his wife, but who must live like a Shaker now,\r\ncelibate and communal. And Ruth and Susan Epps to the chamber where the\r\nfemales slept, where the little girls, Annie and Sarah, were slumbering already.\r\nLeaving Father and Mary alone downstairs in their bed near the parlor\r\nfireplace, where the Old Man, I knew, in his enthusiasm for this new turn of\r\nevents, and conscious of the oncoming prolonged absence from his wife and\r\nhome, would be reaching towards her in the darkness, doing the Lord’s work,\r\nbeing fruitful, multiplying. While Great-Grandfather Brown’s clock ticked loudly\r\nfrom the fireplace mantel.",
    "\r\nIII\r\nChapter 10\r\nA sparkling blue day it was, in early September of that year, when the Old Man\r\nand I took passage for Liverpool aboard the side-wheeler Cumbria, a packet out\r\nof Boston. We had arrived in the city three days earlier, after nearly a fortnight’s\r\nstay in Springfield, where Father had made his usual, tireless attempt to set\r\nthings right with his and Mr. Perkins’s creditors, succeeding only in extending\r\nhis and Mr. Perkins’s line of credit with the western sheepmen for the length of\r\ntime it would take him to sell in England the wool he could not sell in America.\r\nOr would not sell in America. Not for the sixty-five cents per pound he was then\r\nbeing offered—some ten to twenty cents per pound less than he had agreed to\r\npay the sheepmen in Ohio and Pennsylvania.\r\nIt was a simple problem. Father had taken shipment of vast quantities of wool\r\nfrom the west and had been storing it in the Springfield warehouse, after having\r\npromised, with Mr. Perkins’s guarantees, to pay the western producers\r\nsignificantly more for it than the woolen merchants and cloth manufacturers in\r\nNew England were then offering. And now, twelve and more months later, the\r\nproducers were clamoring for their money, which Father, of course, did not\r\nhave. To break a monopoly among the buyers, Father had tried to create a\r\nmonopoly among the sellers. Basically, the problem had arisen because the\r\nbuyers could afford to wait out the sellers.\r\nIn vain did I argue the wisdom of cutting all his losses off at once and\r\nreturning quickly to the farm in North Elba, there to build a small tannery, such\r\nas he had established in New Richmond when I was a child, back before Mother\r\ndied—a modest, local business adequate to our needs and in no way dependent\r\nupon his abilities to anticipate and resist the machinations of shrewd, calculating\r\nmen of great wealth residing elsewhere.",
    "\r\nTo me, paper money, promissory notes, letters and lines of credit, market\r\nfluctuations, tariff laws, and so on were as abstract and metaphysical as German\r\nspeculative philosophy. To Father, however, they were oddly concrete, as real as\r\nthe food he ate, as the water he heated for his morning shave, as the tobacco-\r\ncolored long-tailed wool suit he wore every day of his adult life. Consequently,\r\nhe believed that he could move among the elements of finance with the same\r\nease and control he employed in ordering up his supper in a hotel dining room\r\nor firing a kettle of cold water every morning or pressing out the wrinkles in his\r\ntrousers by placing them beneath his mattress while he slept. He was like the\r\nunlucky gambler who can’t believe in any luck but good and keeps on trying to\r\ncover his old losses by making new bets.\r\nI never thought Father mad, as he was so often later portrayed, except now\r\nand again, and especially in these matters of finance. But it was a madness that\r\nin those days he shared with most men of ability and restless intelligence. It was\r\nlike a plague, this dream of growing rich by speculation, and not to become\r\ninfected with it was a sign of dullness and low intelligence. My argument against\r\nFather’s scheme, then, carried very little weight. To him, it was the argument of\r\na simple man or a man with no ambition.\r\nBrother John, I believe, was on the Old Man’s side in this and had caught the\r\ndisease himself, although he had not as extreme a case as Father’s, and while\r\nJason seemed as immune from the plague as I, he, unlike me, appeared little\r\nbothered by the Old Man’s feverish schemes and delusions and, except when\r\nFather demanded his filial aid and comfort, tended quietly to his own affairs—\r\nhis vineyards and orchards in Ohio. Jason maintained a benign independence of\r\nFather that I envied but barely understood.",
    " “Owen,” he used to say to me, with\r\nthat sweet, yet slightly ironic, smile playing across his lips, “you’ve got to let it\r\nalone. The Old Man’s going to do what he wants, no matter how much you fret\r\nand fume over it. You might as well stand back, brother, and just try to enjoy the\r\nshow.”\r\nIt was never that easy for me. How was it possible not to go along with the Old\r\nMan and not fail him? I could not imagine myself doing it. I was tied to him like\r\na wife, a child, a slave, it sometimes seemed—although, of course, I well knew\r\nthat the chains that bound me to him were entirely of my own making. After all,\r\nfrom the end of my childhood, at about the age of sixteen, Father had not once\r\nforbade me from leading any sort of life that I wanted. That I was living his life,\r\nas it appeared, or one that was a mere appendage of his, was a measure not so\r\nmuch of his power as of my weakness.\r\nIn Boston for the few days before our departure on the Cumbria, I trailed after\r\nthe Old Man like a puppy as he attended afternoon and evening public and\r\nprivate meetings. Abolitionism was everywhere in Boston then. Argued and\r\narticulated with all the zeal and refined intelligence of the old Puritans’ debate\r\nover Free Will and Grace, it was, for all of that, mere talk, or so it seemed to\r\nFather and me—talk driven and framed by reckless passion, as if being right or\r\nwrong on the subject were more important to the debaters than saving people’s\r\nlives, not to mention their souls.\r\nWe were staying at the home of an abolitionist colleague of Father’s—a\r\nphilanthropic friend of Mr. Gerrit Smith’s, actually, from whom Father had\r\nobtained a general-purpose letter of introduction for use in England. The\r\ngentleman was the well-known Dr.",
    " Samuel Gridley Howe, and he and his\r\npleasant, hospitable wife, the poet Julia Ward Howe, an heiress, had given us a\r\nroom in their grand residence on Louisburg Square. It was a tall brick house with\r\nbow windows facing the street on every storey, so that you could stand and look\r\ndown upon the busy street below, like a captain of industry surveying his shop.\r\nThe city of Boston was like that then, a busy manufactory where everything,\r\nfrom bread and feathered hats to religious ideas and fine art, was manufactured,\r\npurveyed, distributed, consumed, and commented upon with remarkable\r\nefficiency and general alacrity, a humming machine in which every citizen was a\r\npart, from the humblest illiterate Irish newsboy or maid to the loftiest Harvard\r\nscholar or Beacon Hill theologian.\r\nI loved the city at once and might well have run off from Father then and there\r\nand made it my permanent home, like the young Ben Franklin fleeing his home\r\nto seek his fortune in Philadelphia, had I, like Franklin, a proper trade or some\r\nother means of making my living than that of caring for sheep or homesteading\r\nnorthern wildernesses. If, in other words, I had not been my father’s third son. It\r\nwas strange, although I did not recognize it as such then, to be so young and to\r\nbe filled already with regret. It was as if, at the age of twenty-six, I viewed my\r\ndaily life with a nostalgia for a life that I had never led and never would lead. I\r\nknew other young men who felt as I did, but they were men who had married\r\ntoo quickly and woke every morning with the vain desire to start their lives over\r\nagain, youths who, every day, by the time they dressed for work and came to the\r\ntable for breakfast, had to accept yet again that they were stuck with a life they\r\ndid not want. But no man of my acquaintance who was my age and was not\r\nunhappily married felt as sadly trapped as I.",
    " Nor would any one of them have\r\nunderstood it in me. They might well have wished to be me.\r\nI remember that we arrived in Boston from Springfield by train in the late\r\nafternoon and had no sooner set down our bags and paid our respects to Dr. and\r\nMrs. Howe than we were off, headed down the tilted brick sidewalks of Beacon\r\nHill to the Charles Street Meeting House to see and hear the famous Mr. Ralph\r\nWaldo Emerson, who was to speak that very evening on the wonderful subject of\r\nheroism. Dr. Howe had put Father onto this event with the observation that the\r\nConcord sage would be addressing the issue of the proper response to slavery for\r\nthe modern intellectual. It was apparently a talk the Doctor and his wife had\r\nalready been privileged to hear at the Concord Atheneum, where it had been\r\ndelivered to an audience of skeptics, a crew of Garrisonian, non-violent\r\nabolitionists, and had swept them all over to the radical side of the debate. An\r\ninflammatory gesture, then, was what Father expected, a call to arms, a\r\nprescriptive description of a new kind of American hero.\r\nWe arrived early and sat in the third row of seats, as close to the front as\r\npossible. Soon the large hall was filled, mostly with distinguished-looking men\r\nand women whose bearing and gazes were the epitome of benevolent\r\nintelligence and whose manners bespoke, not arrogance, but simple, if well-fed,\r\nself-confidence. A more civilized collection of human beings I had never seen,\r\nand I could not keep myself from turning in my seat and craning my neck to see\r\nand admire them as they entered from the darkening street and took their\r\nplaces.\r\nFather sat stiffly with his hands on his knees, staring straight ahead, as if he\r\nwere alone in the audience or were in an antechamber awaiting an interview\r\nwith a prospective employer.",
    " There were several people who must be famous, I\r\nthought, if only because of the way other folks, when this one or that entered\r\nand took his seat, at once stared and whispered to their companions. But I\r\nrecognized no one, of course. Could that handsome, eagle-eyed man be Charles\r\nSumner? Could that small burl of a woman next to him be the famous agitator\r\nfor female rights and abolition, Lydia Maria Child? Might the sublimely\r\nintelligent Transcendentalist philosopher William Everett Channing be here\r\namongst us?\r\nI knew none of these illustrious people, of course, except by their marvelous\r\nreputations, and I believed that anyone who looked more distinguished than\r\nFather, as these people surely did, must be at least as distinguished as he and\r\nthen some. Unlike Father, they had lived in Boston all their lives and came from\r\nwealthy old families and had been privileged by fine educations and social\r\nrelations with one another: they were bound to be beacons on a height. So I\r\nbelieved. And Father’s light, by comparison, was a flickering candle cupped in\r\nhis hand against the wind. I was, therefore, not so much ashamed of Father in\r\nthis context as sorry for him, especially sitting there stock-still and stiff in his\r\nseat, red-faced and tense, his large, workingman’s hands and wrists sticking out\r\nfrom his sleeves, his mouth tight, his gray eyes staring straight up at the podium.\r\nIn this impressive company of likeminded people, Father seemed, not enhanced,\r\nbut sadly, surprisingly diminished.\r\nAnd when a hush settled over the crowd and Mr. Emerson in utter simplicity\r\nand with no introduction came forward and began to speak, Father, poor Father,\r\nseemed even smaller than before, to the point of disappearing altogether from\r\nmy ken, which almost never happened in a public place, for I was rarely able to\r\nignore him or his reactions to a speech or sermon.",
    " Busily fashioning my own\r\nreaction around what I supposed was his, I seldom heard clearly the speech or\r\nsermon itself.\r\nThis occasion was different, however. To me, Mr. Emerson was every inch the\r\nideal poet and sage, and if a man may be said to be beautiful, he was that.\r\nSlender, but strong and supple-looking, like a man used to outdoor exercise, of\r\nmedium height with a noble carriage and easy, natural gestures, he stood before\r\nus and spoke in a voice that, while intimate and almost conversational in tone,\r\ncarried to the furthest reaches of the hall, for his every word seemed raptly\r\nattended to, even by the last few fellows to squeeze in at the door in back. From\r\nhis first sentence to his last, there was not a whisper or a rustle from the\r\naudience. He relied on none of the usual rhetorical flourishes of the arm and\r\nmighty brow that were then so popular with public speakers; none of the tricks\r\nof voice and variations of pace and volume to surprise the audience and gain its\r\nattention cheaply. Instead, he spoke simply, directly, in a way that made you feel\r\nthat he was speaking to you alone and to no one else in the hall. His bright eyes\r\nwere the color of bluebells and did not fix on any single person but fixed on the\r\nspace just above one’s own head, as if he were contemplating one’s thoughts as\r\nthey rose in the air. Now and again, he would glance down at the text before\r\nhim, as if to take in a new paragraph or sometimes an entire page, and then his\r\nlarge, handsome head would lift, and he would go on, with no hesitation or\r\nbreak in the flow of his speech. He was at that time in his mid-forties, I suppose,\r\nin the prime of his manhood, although he seemed both younger—in the clarity\r\nand openness of his expression—and older—in the wise self-assurance of his\r\ndelivery.",
    "\r\nAwed and rapt as I was, especially at the start, I did not make out much of\r\nwhat he said, as he was at first speaking of figures and literary works I had never\r\nheard of—a playwright named Beaumont Fletcher was one, and various\r\ncharacters from the plays. But I did catch that he was indeed speaking of\r\nheroism and how it had been misunderstood in the past, as much misunderstood\r\nby poets and playwrights as by politicians. He intended here, he declared, to\r\nunderstand it freshly. And he seemed, as Dr. Howe and his wife had promised, to\r\nbe applying that new understanding of heroism to our present dilemma with\r\nregard to the issue of slavery generally and the abolitionist movement in\r\nparticular.\r\nIn the work of the elder British dramatists, he said, there was a constant,\r\nobsessive recognition of gentility, just as skin color is recognized in our society\r\ntoday. A marvelous and original reversal, I thought, of how we normally think of\r\nthose two aspects of society—gentility, or the classes of men, and race. Opposites\r\nare made to seem apposite. Yes, this was a freshened way of looking at things.\r\nThen, after a while, he began to isolate and examine the various\r\nmanifestations of heroism, as if, on the surface, he were discussing merely the\r\nliterary heros, but all the same, with hints and subtle asides, indicating that our\r\npresent national crisis over slavery was the necessary field for such a person. He\r\nwas calling for the arrival of a man out of Plutarch, one of Father’s favorite\r\nauthors also, I noted with pleasure, a man who could refute the despondency\r\nand cowardice of our religious and political theorists with “a wild courage, a\r\nstoicism not of the schools, but of the blood!” Mr. Emerson wanted a “tart\r\ncathartic virtue!’ he said, that could contend with the violations of the laws of\r\nnature committed by our predecessors and by our contemporaries.",
    " And here he\r\nlapsed into language—or I should say, he rose to language—that, although not\r\nonce uttering the word itself, excoriated slavery horribly and with great\r\noriginality. It is a lock-jaw, he said, that bends a man’s head back to his heels. It\r\nis a hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes, an insanity that\r\nmakes him eat grass.\r\nA man must confront and confound all this external evil, he explained, with a\r\nmilitary attitude of the soul. This is the beginnings of heroism, this attitude. The\r\nhero advances to his own music, and there is somewhat that is not philosophical\r\nin heroism, he noted, somewhat not holy in it. “Heroism seems not to know that\r\nother souls are of one texture with it. It has pride. It is the extreme of individual\r\nnature,” he declared. These words struck fire with me, for, of course, they\r\ndescribed my father perfectly, and I wondered if the Old Man himself realized it.\r\nOr was that, too, characteristic of heroism—that the hero does not recognize\r\nhimself as heroic?\r\nThere was more, much more, that put me in mind of Father, as Mr. Emerson\r\ncontinued. Heroism, he told us, is almost ashamed of its body.\r\nAnd this: that the stoical temperance of the hero is loved by him for its\r\nelegance, not for its austerity. “A great man scarcely knows how he dines, how\r\nhe dresses, but without railing or precision, his living is natural and poetic.”\r\nMr. Emerson spoke in an aphoristic style that, no matter how obscure or\r\nabstract his thought and language, made it easy for me to understand his ideas\r\nand remember his words and quote them afterwards to those who were not so\r\nlucky as to have heard them in person. I remember, years later, spouting, as if\r\nthey were my own, Mr. Emerson’s words that night in Boston.",
    " My companions\r\nwere humble men, Negro and white men, huddled with me around a campfire in\r\nKansas or holed up in a freezing cabin in Iowa or a farmhouse in Maryland, and I\r\nwould try to inspire them by saying things like, “The characteristic of heroism is\r\nits persistency.” And, “If you would serve your brother, because it is fit for you\r\nto serve him, do not take back your words when you find that prudent people do\r\nnot commend you.” And this, which became thereafter my personal motto:\r\n“Always do what you are most afraid to do.”\r\nHigh counsel was how I took Mr. Emerson’s talk on heroism. High counsel, and\r\nprophecy, too. “Times of heroism!” he explained, “are generally times of terror.”\r\nAnd then he recalled for us the martyrdom of the brave Lovejoy who, in the\r\nname of the Bill of Rights and his right to shout against the sin of slavery, gave\r\nhimself over to the rage of the mob. We now are living in a time of terror, was\r\nMr. Emerson’s point, and thus are we likewise about to see the arrival of our\r\nheroes. They are coming soon. And we must be prepared to recognize them\r\nwhen they appear in our midst, and Mr. Emerson was bending all his\r\nconsiderable, all his incomparable, talents and wisdom to that end. Who could\r\nnot be grateful?\r\nWell, Father, for one. Perhaps Father alone. In the midst of the applause at the\r\nend of Mr. Emerson’s lecture, Father rose from his seat, to applaud the more\r\nenthusiastically, I first thought. But, no, it was to leave the hall, and with a\r\nglower on his face, he made his way past the laps of his neighbors and hurriedly,\r\npointedly, stalked up the aisle to the exit at the rear. Shocked and more than\r\nslightly embarrassed by his rude departure, I followed, head down, and joined\r\nhim on the street.\r\nFor a few moments, we walked in silence. “That man’s truly a boob!” Father\r\nblurted. “For the life of me, I can’t understand his fame.",
    " Unless the whole world\r\nis just as foolish as he is. Godless? He’s not even rational! You’d think, given his\r\ngodlessness, his sec-u-laahr-ity, he’d be at least rational” he said, and gave a\r\nsardonic laugh.\r\n“Yes, but didn’t... didn’t you admire his language?” Mr. Emerson had used\r\nlanguage in an oblique and original way that, while it made his personality shine\r\nbrilliantly, also had made the ostensible subject of his talk opaque, so that, to\r\nunderstand him, one had practically to invent for oneself what he was saying. I\r\nfound this experience nearly wonderful, as if he were speaking poetry. But I\r\nknew not what to point to in Mr. Emerson’s lecture that might have appealed to\r\nFather. If you did not swallow the whole of it, you could not accept a part. And\r\nif you accepted a part, you had to be nourished by the whole.\r\n“His language? Come on, Owen. Airy nonsense, that’s all it is. For substance,\r\nthe man offers us clouds, fogs, mists of words. ‘Times of terror; indeed! What\r\ndoes he know of terror? Ralph Waldo Emerson has neither the wit nor the soul to\r\nknow terror. And he surely has no Christian belief in him! That’s what ought to\r\nbe terrifying him, the state of his own naked soul.” He sputtered on as we\r\nwalked back to Dr. Howe’s residence, where the good Mrs. Howe had promised\r\nto leave us some cold supper.\r\nI followed silently, pondering the meaning and import of his fulmination, even\r\nas I nurtured an odd thought which had come to me towards the end of Mr.\r\nEmerson’s peroration—that Father resembled no man so much as the Concord\r\npoet himself. The Old Man was a rough-cut, Puritan version of Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson, it seemed to me that first night in Boston and for many years\r\nafterwards, and even unto the present time, when it matters probably not at all.\r\nBut it was that night of some personal significance to me.",
    "\r\nEven physically, the two looked enough alike to have been brothers—although\r\nFather would have been the cruder, more muscular version. They both wore old-\r\nfashioned, hawk-nosed, Yankee faces with pale, deep-set eyes that looked out at\r\nthe world with such an unblinking gaze as to force you to avert your own gaze\r\nat once or give yourself over to the man’s will. And just as easily and selflessly as\r\nFather believed in his God, Mr. Emerson believed in the power and everlasting\r\ntruth of what he called Nature. For both men, God, or Nature, was beginning,\r\ncause, and end, and man was merely an agent for beginning, cause, and end.\r\nAs I walked, dropping further and further behind the Old Man in my reverie, I\r\nfound myself amusing myself with the picture of Mr. Emerson coming off a\r\nmeeting with Father and imagined him saying the same things to his son about\r\nthe crazy man John Brown. “The man’s truly a boob! For the life of me, I can’t\r\nunderstand his fame!” For if there was a flaw in Mr. Emerson’s argument, it is\r\nthat he was probably incapable of seeing my father as the very hero he was\r\ncalling for. And if there was a flaw in my father’s heroism, it may be that he\r\ncould not see himself in Mr. Emerson’s portrait.\r\nWe turned off Charles Street to make our way uphill towards Louisburg\r\nSquare, and I remember a young man striding downhill in our direction, well-\r\ndressed, fresh-faced, and whistling a tune—no tune I recognized; like a bird he\r\nwas, whistling for the sheer pleasure of it. A purely happy fellow, undivided in\r\nhimself, it seemed, as if he’d been successfully courting a lovely maiden and had\r\nbeen invited to return tomorrow evening to continue. He whistled past and\r\ncontinued down the street, to his bachelor rooms, no doubt. A happy man!",
    " I\r\nstopped in my tracks and watched him for a few seconds, wondering what it felt\r\nlike, to be so uncomplicatedly happy as he, when Father called, “Hurry, Owen!\r\nKeep up, keep up! Don’t stare after people like a bumpkin.”\r\nI quickly caught up to him, and when we had walked on in silence a ways, the\r\nOld Man, in a low voice that suggested he was having second thoughts, asked\r\nme what was my true opinion of Mr. Emerson’s lecture. I saw that he was now\r\nsomewhat embarrassed by his earlier outburst and that some of the poet’s words\r\nmay in fact have touched him. Perhaps he had been stung by their similarity to\r\nhis own thoughts and beliefs and had never before heard them so handsomely\r\nexpressed, and thus his anger had been directed not at Mr. Emerson but at\r\nhimself.\r\n“Truthfully?”\r\n“Yes.”\r\n“Well, I have to say, I took his words as high counsel, Father. And prophecy.”\r\nHe did not answer at first. Then he said, “High counsel, eh? You heard that?\r\nYou heard that and nothing else, nothing that contradicted your beliefs?”\r\n“No. What I heard only corroborated my beliefs and strengthened me in them.\r\nNot everything Mister Emerson said was altogether clear to me, of course, but all\r\nof it was very beautiful. All of it.”\r\nI thought that Father would then upbraid me, but instead he pursed his lips as\r\nhe often did when thinking something through for the first time and said, “Very\r\ninteresting. That’s interesting to me, Owen. And prophecy? You heard that, too?”\r\n“Well, yes. I believe so.”\r\n“Very interesting. High counsel and prophecy. Well, who knows? God speaks\r\nto us in unexpected ways. Even in the words of philosophers,” he said, and\r\nsmiled and reached up and put his arm over my shoulder.\r\nWe briskly walked that way, side by side, the remaining few blocks to Dr.",
    "\r\nHowe’s home, and the entire distance, as I strode along, I whistled the same,\r\nnearly tuneless tune that I’d heard the happy young man whistle before. I\r\nbelieve that I felt for those few moments just as he had; and it was grand.\r\nI was no more eager to depart with Father from Boston, even for a place as\r\ninviting as England, than I had been to leave Springfield for Timbuctoo, and for\r\nmany of the same reasons. Here, in a city amongst a multitude of distractions\r\nand competing truths, it was easier not to succumb to the singular force of\r\nFather’s truth. I was stronger here. Isolation—such as we had endured in\r\nTimbuctoo and even to a lesser degree back in Ohio and before that in New\r\nRichmond, and such as I knew I would endure with Father aboard a ship and in\r\na foreign land-bound me, bound all us Browns, the more tightly to the Old Man’s\r\nview of things.\r\nHere in Boston, however, even more than in Springfield, I saw good men and\r\nwomen everywhere who despised slavery, who had thought deeply and long on\r\nmatters of religion and moral philosophy, and who loved goodness and truth\r\nfully as much as did Father, and yet they seemed not so fierce and judgemental\r\nin their ways as he. Perhaps they were indeed soft and compromised by wealth\r\nand privilege, as Father claimed, made prideful by their fame and the admiration\r\nof their like-minded, high-minded compatriots. Perhaps Father was right, and\r\nthey were, as he liked to say, “boobs.” But I could not help but admire their easy\r\ntolerance of one another and their patient optimism. Father’s way was lonely,\r\npainfully lonely to me, and I never felt it so much as when we were circulating\r\nin cities amongst the men and women who should normally have been our\r\nnatural allies.\r\nIn the holy war against slavery, Father seemed more and more, and especially\r\nhere in Boston, like a Separatist.",
    " I found myself growing cross and impatient\r\nwith him for it and the next day nearly quarreled with him. He and I had gone\r\ndown to the docks from Dr. Howe’s to confirm our bookings aboard the Cumbria\r\nand to verify our Monday morning departure with the tide two days thence, and\r\nalso just to look at the ship itself, to appraise her size and proportions, so as to\r\nanticipate better the degree of our physical discomfort for the duration of our\r\njourney. Neither of us had ever traveled so far before—our longest journey by\r\nboat may have been the ferry across Lake Champlain from Vermont to New York\r\nor a horse-drawn barge on the Erie Canal. And though, naturally, we did not\r\nspeak of it to one another, we were both more than a little nervous and even\r\nsomewhat fearful.\r\nI had been noticing, as we walked along the thronged streets, printed\r\nadvertisements for an address by Mr. William Lloyd Garrison that evening at the\r\nPark Street Church. They had been posted all over the city, many of them\r\ndeliberately torn down and trampled underfoot, it seemed. Despite its\r\nreputation, Boston was no more undivided in those days over the issue of slavery\r\nthan any other Northern city—which is to say that the white citizens who\r\nopposed the institution altogether, who were for abolition, complete and forever,\r\nin all the states, were a distinct minority—a tiny minority. And those who were\r\nfor slavery, who thought it a positive good, which ought to be extended over all\r\nthe western territories, they, too, were a tiny minority. The vast majority in\r\nbetween just wanted the problem to go away. And while the majority did not\r\nexactly approve of the enslavement of Negroes, they deeply resented their white\r\nneighbors who had chosen to make an issue of it.",
    "\r\nIn Boston, however, numbered among the people who did make an issue of it\r\nwere some of the most respectable and admired citizens in the entire country.\r\nThanks to the reputations of Theodore Parker and William Ellery Channing and\r\nDr. and Mrs. Howe and dozens of other luminaries in the fields of education, the\r\narts, public service, commerce, and religion, it was here, more than anywhere\r\nelse in America, that civic virtue, high-mindedness, and theology had gotten\r\nassociated with abolitionism. Overt opposition to it, therefore, got expressed\r\nmostly by ruffians and drunkards, while the respectable citizens stayed home,\r\nsilently tolerated both sides, and felt smugly above the fray, as if the two\r\nminorities, in the eyes of God and the ongoing history of the Republic, neatly\r\ncanceled each other out.\r\nStopped for a moment at a crowded intersection, I suggested to Father that it\r\nwould be nice if we could hear Mr. William Lloyd Garrison speak tonight at the\r\nmeeting of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. “We might not have another\r\nchance to hear him in person,” I said brightly.\r\nHe shot me a puzzled, slightly irritated look and, without answering, darted\r\ninto the cobbled street and strode on ahead of me.\r\nI hurried to catch up, and when I was beside him again, I said in a loud voice,\r\n“Well, if not Ralph Waldo Emerson calling for a new heroism at the Charles\r\nStreet Meeting House, then why not William Lloyd Garrison denouncing slavery\r\nat the Park Street Church?”\r\n“What?”\r\n“If not the radical Transcendentalist, then why not the radical Christian? Are\r\nwe too pure for The Liberator, too?” Since my early childhood, Mr. Garrison’s\r\nsheet had come to us on the front lines like a trusted messenger sent from the\r\nheadquarters of the army waging war against slavery. Father had used that very\r\nfigure himself. Numerous times, I reminded him.",
    "\r\n“Yes, I have used the figure,” he admitted. “But you mistook it. I meant it as a\r\ncriticism of what’s exactly the problem with these pacifistic ‘society’ men and\r\nwomen.” We were by now down amongst the piers below the Custom House—a\r\nwhole city of wharves and warehouses, a clattering tangle of crates, bales, tubs,\r\nand kegs and all manner of cartons and free-standing goods arriving, departing,\r\nand stopped at various stages in between; of shippers and trans-shippers and\r\nreceivers of goods from all over the world. There was tea and silk from China,\r\nrum and molasses from the West Indies, carpets and ivory from India, and from\r\nthe European nations everything from French lace to Lancaster steel, from\r\nDresden paper to Portuguese wine.\r\n“They think that we’re the corporals and they’re the generals’ he went on.\r\n“And men like Garrison, all they’re interested in is becoming commander-in-\r\nchief. So they waste their time and other people’s money squabbling amongst\r\nthemselves, while our Negro brethren languish in slavery. Action, action, action,\r\nOwen! That’s what I want! Enough of this talk, talk, talk.”\r\n“Then you won’t go with me” I said.\r\nIt was a noisy, chaotic scene down there amongst the stone wharves and\r\nwarehouses, and difficult to carry on a normal conversation with wagons and\r\ncarts rumbling past and stevedores, lumpers, and teamsters hollering and\r\ndrunken seamen lurching through the throng. Although it was a September\r\nafternoon, it was as warm and humid as mid-summer, and most of the workmen\r\nwere shirtless and sweating. Seagulls screamed and begged in brazen crowds or\r\nwaddled along the edges of the piers or perched half-asleep on the stanchions\r\nand atop the hundreds of chimneys and masts of steamers and sailing ships and\r\ncoastal packets reaching into the sky like a forest of pines. The smells of fish and\r\nrum were heavy in the air.",
    " In later years, I always associated those odors with\r\nthe Boston waterfront: fish at the edge of turning, and the sweet, burnt-sugar\r\nsmell of Jamaican rum—a dizzying, in no way unpleasant smell that touched my\r\nbrain and staggered me like a drink of raw whiskey.\r\nFather said, “Well, yes, I might be willing to hear Mister Garrison. Out of\r\ncuriosity. But he’s elected to speak on the Sabbath.” He meant, of course, after\r\nsunset on a Saturday. “If it were to be a prayer meeting, fine. I’d attend. But\r\notherwise, no. And it does seem otherwise, as he is a Quaker.”\r\n“May I attend, then, and report back to you?”\r\n“As you wish. You’re not bound by my religion, Owen.” “No.”\r\n“I will return to the Howes’ and read awhile and pray.” “Why do I not feel\r\nreleased, Father?” I said.\r\nHe smiled back. “I dare not guess.”\r\nWe did not speak of it again but went about our business at the office of the\r\nshipping agent for the Cumbria—which, to these landlubbers and viewed from\r\nthe dock, appeared quite seaworthy—and returned to the Howes’ in time for a\r\npleasant early supper of stuffed grouse served on fancy China plates with\r\ngenuine antique silverware from France. Later that evening, still secretly angry\r\nwith Father, who remained closeted in our rooms at prayer, I headed out, by\r\nway of Beacon Street, to the Park Street Church, which was located not far from\r\nLouisburg Square on Beacon Hill. Beacon Street ran alongside the wide expanse\r\nof the famed Common, with a facing row opposite of large, old brick town\r\nhouses, the patrician homes of many of Boston’s elite.",
    " As I walked, I kept to that\r\nside of the street, close by the tall, elegant houses and as far from the darkened\r\nCommon as possible, for there—lurking among the shrubs and trees and\r\nappearing suddenly out of the darkness to glare and howl at the decorous, well-\r\ndressed men and women walking peacefully towards the church—was the\r\nenemy.\r\nThey were boys, mostly, and young men, idlers and drunkards, brawlers, louts,\r\nwhoremongers, and common thieves; there were numerous females among them,\r\ntoo, maps and doxies as wild and brutal looking as their brothers. It was not so\r\nmuch their unwashed physiognomies that made them appear brutal and coarse,\r\nas their rage. No matter how noble the human face in repose, how symmetrical,\r\nfresh, and clear it may appear, when the brow is bent and glowered down, the\r\nmouth misshapen by an obscene word, the nostrils flared in revulsion and the\r\nlips sneering, and when the fist gets doubled and held out like a weapon, one\r\nrecoils as if from a sub-species, as if from a demonic, bestial version of one’s self.\r\nHow can we all be humans alike, when one of us has turned suddenly so ugly?\r\nAnd when a whole crowd turns ugly, turns itself into a mob, what species is it\r\nthen?\r\nI could fairly well smell the brandy and beer on the breath of the youths who\r\nstuck their whiskered faces out at me and brayed their Negro-hating sentiments\r\nat me and the other men and women who were silently, peacefully walking the\r\nsidewalk alongside me. The gang cackled and screeched and sometimes even\r\ntossed a rock and then ducked back into the bushes out of sight, to be replaced a\r\nfew rods further on by another gang, whose drunken members would pick up the\r\nchant. “Nigger-lovers!” they hollered. “Yer nigger-lovers! Yer niggers yerself!\r\nUgly black niggers! Ugly black niggers!",
    "” And so on, stupidly, even idiotically,\r\nthey ranted—until we were walking a kind of gauntlet, it seemed, or proceeding\r\nthrough a maddened, howling mob to our own public hanging, headed not to a\r\nplace of worship but to a scaffold. How courageous, I thought, were these men\r\nand women beside me, many of them elderly, who walked in silence along the\r\nsidewalk, being jeered and tormented by people with murder in their eyes. That\r\nour pale complexions protected us, keeping us from being physically attacked by\r\nthem and possibly even killed, caused me to realize anew that white is as much a\r\ncolor as black. Our flag, our uniform, was our white skin, and while it provoked\r\nthis attack from our fellow whites, it also shielded us from serious harm.\r\nNonetheless, once inside the large, clean, rationally proportioned sanctuary of\r\nthe church, I breathed a great sigh of relief and realized that I had been seriously\r\nfrightened by the harassment of the mob—although it was hard to distinguish\r\nfear from anger. My legs felt watery, and my heart was thumping. I wanted to\r\nstrike out, to hit and hurt those foul mouths, and it had taken great restraint for\r\nme simply to appear to ignore them and walk serenely along to my meeting like\r\nthe others, instead of picking up a loose brick or thrown rock and hurling it back\r\nat the coward who had thrown it, or chasing the fellows into the bushes and\r\nthrashing them there. I was a big, sturdy young man then and could easily have\r\ntossed three or four of them around like so much cordwood. Indeed, had one of\r\nthem actually struck me with a rock, I believe I would have lost my serenity and\r\nrushed across Beacon Street after him. I was never a Quaker.\r\nNone of the others, however, as they entered the church, seemed in the\r\nslightest bothered by the caterwauling of the mob outside.",
    " They treated it like a\r\ndisagreeable rain and seemed to brush it off their cloaks and shawls as they\r\nentered the foyer and greeted one another cheerfully and took their seats inside.\r\nStanding there in the foyer, shivering with rage—or fear—and tamping down\r\nfantasies of violent retribution, I, however, suddenly felt ashamed of myself.\r\n“Action, action, action!” was Father’s call, but here, in this serene and pacifistic\r\ncontext, action seemed vile, easy, childish. Mr. Garrison’s perspective, I knew,\r\nand that of the Anti-Slavery Society as a whole, was based on the Quaker\r\nphilosophy of non-violence, and it was easy to criticize it from afar, while\r\ngnashing one’s teeth over the ongoing injustice of slavery and its growing power\r\nin Washington during those years. But here, in the face of the mob, pacifism\r\nseemed downright courageous and almost beautiful.\r\nI was suddenly glad that Father was not at my side, for although he, like me,\r\nprobably would not have charged into the woods of the Common to thrash his\r\ntormentors, he surely would have entered the foyer of the church growling and\r\nsnarling at the weakness of the Society members for not having created a stout\r\nand well-armed security force from amongst their membership and posting it all\r\nalong Park Street to protect their meetings.\r\n“If you behave as slaves, you will be treated as slaves,” he often said. He said\r\nit to freed Negroes; he said it to sympathetic whites. “If you wish to do the\r\nLord’s work on earth, you must gird your loins and buckle on your armor and\r\nsword and march straightway against the enemy.”\r\nAh, Father, how you shame me one minute and anger me the next. How your\r\npractical wisdom, which at times borders on a love of violence for its own sake,\r\nchallenges my intermittent pacifism, which borders on cowardice. Your voice\r\nstops me cold, and then divides me.",
    " One day and in one context, I am a warrior\r\nfor Christ. The next day, in a different context, I am one of His meekest lambs. If\r\nonly in the beginning, when I was a child, I had been able, like so many of my\r\nwhite countrymen, to believe that the fight to end slavery was not my fight, that\r\nit was merely one more item in the long list of human failings and society’s evils\r\nthat we must endure, then I surely would have become a happy, undivided man.\r\nWith thoughts like these, then, and in a kind of dulled despondency, I took my\r\nseat in a pew at the rear of the sanctuary, for the church was nearly filled by\r\nnow with proper Bostonians, all of them white people, well-dressed, with the\r\nbenignly expectant faces of people gathered for the dedication of an equestrian\r\nstatue. Indeed, the meeting itself, once it got under way, was not unlike just such\r\na ceremony. Father would have been appalled, and even I was somewhat\r\nembarrassed for being there.\r\nMy mind wandered during the benediction and the welcome to new members\r\nand guests, and I did not rise like the other newcomers to introduce myself to\r\nthe assembly—out of embarrassment, no doubt, but also because at the proper\r\nmoment I was thinking of something else and was not sure, when I saw a\r\nscattering of folks in the audience stand and heard them, one by one, say their\r\nnames, what the ceremony was all about. I was thinking about the packs of wild\r\nboys and men outside and their dark domain beyond.\r\nEven before Mr. Garrison appeared, I rose from my seat and left. In a moment,\r\nI was back on the street. The howlers were gone, disappeared into the darkness\r\nof the Common, where I supposed they now lurked, waiting for their prey to\r\nemerge from the church, when they would resume barking and snarling at them.",
    "\r\nI think back to that night from this vantage point a half-century later, and I\r\ncannot remember what, if anything, was in my mind when I crossed the street\r\nand stepped into the thicket there. I cannot imagine what my intentions were, as\r\nI stumbled down the unfamiliar slope in darkness and made my way towards the\r\nrough pasture in the middle, where in the distance I saw what appeared to be a\r\nscattering of small campfires and huts made of cast-off boards and old pieces of\r\ncanvas sheeting. Now and again, the figure of a man or a pair of men passed\r\nnear enough for me to see and be seen, and, once, a fellow said to me, “Evenin,\r\nmate,” almost as if hed recognized my face, and passed into the darkness close\r\nby. When I looked back over my shoulder to see where he had gone, I saw him\r\nstop and step forward from the shadows towards me, as if expecting me to\r\nfollow. I said nothing and plunged ahead, in the direction of the distant firelight.\r\nGiddy with an unidentifiable excitement and breathing heavily, as if after\r\ngreat exertion, I made my way slowly over the rough, cloddy ground, which\r\ngradually opened onto a broad, unmowed field. Oddly, I felt myself to be in no\r\ndanger. I was not being pushed from behind, but rather was being drawn\r\nforward, as if by some powerful, magnetic force emanating from in front of me.\r\nIt was a clear, warm night. The sky was crossed with broad swaths of stars and\r\na gibbous moon, which gave enough light for me gradually to gain a sense of the\r\nspace I was in. Although it lay just beyond a ridge of elms blackly silhouetted in\r\nthe moonlight, the city of Boston seemed miles from here.",
    " High-minded\r\nmeetings and church services, elegantly appointed dining rooms and parlors and\r\nuniversity lecture halls and counting houses, all the manufactories and dwelling\r\nplaces of proper Boston, seemed far away—and when I pictured Father at that\r\nmoment seated in Dr. Howe’s fine, paneled library in the house on Louisburg\r\nSquare, reading from the Doctor’s leather-bound edition of Milton or one of the\r\nold Puritan divines, it was as if the Old Man were located, not a mere half-mile\r\nfrom me, but someplace halfway to California.\r\nSuddenly, in a way that I had never experienced before, not even when I went\r\nroaming through the nighttime streets and alleyways of Springfield the previous\r\nspring, I felt free of Father. Free of the force of his personality and the authority\r\nof his mind. Free of his rightness. Yes, more than anything else, it was his\r\nrightness that so oppressed me in those years. I could in no way honestly or\r\nopenly oppose it. It exhausted me, humiliated and punished me, and divided me\r\nagainst my true self whenever I sought to liberate myself from his iron control of\r\nmy will. Inevitably, his moral correctness, which I could never deny, brought me\r\nto heel. It was in my bones and blood to follow him wherever his God led him.\r\nFor, although I did not believe in my father’s God, I believed in the principles\r\nthat my father attributed to Him. And so long as the Old Man did not waver in\r\nhis loyalty to those principles, I could not waver in my loyalty to the Old Man.\r\nYet tonight, in this strange sanctuary of darkness, I felt as if I were afloat on\r\nstilled, black waters, drifting in a slow, aimless swirl whose very aimlessness\r\nthrilled me.",
    " A slight shift in the breeze could fix my direction or alter it, and\r\nthus I wandered left and right around boulders and bushes, as the land sloped\r\ngradually away from the place where moments earlier I had departed from the\r\nstreet. I slipped past a knot of men gathered before a small fire and passing a\r\nclay jug and smoking short pipes. One of them spoke to me in a friendly voice.\r\n“Out lookin’ for y’ cat, lad?” he asked. I said no and passed on, and they laughed\r\nlightly behind me. Ghostly figures stepped forward and silently withdrew, and\r\nevery third or fourth of them hissed to me or beckoned for me to follow.\r\nWere these shadowy figures, these frail, gray wraiths and dark spirits, the\r\nsame demonic figures I had seen earlier howling at the good Quaker abolitionists\r\non their way to meeting? These people hardly seemed capable of raising their\r\nvoices, much less shrieking obscenities and tossing rocks and other missiles. But\r\nthen I saw a band of ruffians, seven or eight of them, boldly approaching me,\r\nswigging from a shared bottle and laughing boisterously. They marched straight\r\ntowards me, as if we were on a path and their intent was to force me out of it.\r\nThey were boys, fifteen or sixteen years old, amusing themselves by banding\r\ntogether and playing the bully to solitaries like me. As they neared me, one of\r\nthem hollered, “Out of our way, ye damned bunter, or we’ll slice off y’ prick and\r\nmake y’ eat it!” and the others laughed.\r\nShabby Irish laddies they were, all puffed up with alcohol and the rough\r\npleasure of each other’s company, and I knew what they thought I was, out here\r\nin the night alone—a catamite, a molly-coddle, in search of another. Possibly, in\r\na strange sense, they were right about who I was and what I was doing there, at\r\nleast for this one night in my life. They had no way of knowing for sure,\r\nhowever, and neither did I.",
    " But regardless, I was not about to play the girl for\r\nthem, or the nigger, and step aside so they could march past unimpeded. Instead,\r\nI waded straight into them, as if they were a low wave at a beach.\r\nThere is an anger that drives one, not to suicide or even to contemplate it, but\r\nto place oneself in a situation which has as its outcome only two logical\r\nconclusions—a miraculous triumph over one’s enemies, or one’s own death—so\r\nthat the line between suicide and martyrdom is drawn so fine as not to exist. It\r\nwas a contrivance of my own making, but I did not know it yet, when the first of\r\nthe lads reached forward as if to grasp me by my placket, and I tore his hand\r\naway with my right hand and clubbed him in his grinning face with my left,\r\nsending him sprawling.\r\nThat was as close to miraculous triumph as I came, however. At once, the rest\r\nof the gang was upon me like a pack of wolves taking down an elk in deep snow.\r\nIn pairs and from all sides, they darted in on me and struck me in the face and\r\nbelly and groin, kicked at my knees, and although I did some damage to them,\r\nthey soon had me crouched over, and in seconds, with several hard, well-placed\r\nkicks to my ankles, they had me on the ground face-down, curling in on myself\r\nto protect my head and nether parts from their continuing barrage of kicks and\r\nblows. They said not a word to me or to each other, and now that they had me\r\ndown, businesslike, went straight to work, pounding at me as if they wished to\r\nmurder me. The beating went on for many minutes, until I was beyond pain, or\r\nso encased by it that I could no longer distinguish the individual blows.",
    " Their\r\nboots and fists smacked loudly against my spine and ribs and the back of my\r\nhead and the meat of my arms and legs, pitching my limp body this way and\r\nthat, until finally the force of the blows tumbled me off the path into a shallow\r\ngully beside it, where there was enough bilge and foul-smelling trash that they\r\ndid not want to pursue me there.\r\nI lay still and kept my eyes shut and heard them spit at me but did not feel it. I\r\nheard them laugh and call me names that I did not understand, and then at last\r\nthey either grew bored with the game or thought me unconscious or dead, for\r\nthe spitting and derision ceased, and I heard their boots against the gravel as\r\nthey strode off. And then silence.\r\nFor a long while I lay there in the wet filth. Every time I tried to raise myself,\r\npain shot through my body and forced me back down. Then I believe I lost\r\nconsciousness, for the next I remember is the broad red face of a white-\r\nwhiskered police officer. I was lying on my back in the pathway, looking up at\r\nhis worried expression. I remember his words to me. “Well, now, lad, I guess\r\nyou’re not dead after all,” he said.\r\nIt took two policemen to bring me to Father at Dr. Howe’s house, where I was\r\nlaid out like a corpse on a pallet next to the fireplace in our chamber on the\r\nthird floor. The Doctor and Mrs. Howe wished to attend to me personally, but\r\nFather, after examining me for broken bones and not finding any, other than\r\nseveral likely cracked ribs, would have none of it and insisted on cleaning and\r\ncaring for me himself. To which I had no objection, for Father was a wonderful\r\nand knowledgeable nurse. I was not quite capable of making an objection\r\nanyhow, as I could barely speak through my bloodied and swollen mouth.",
    "\r\nBesides, I was deeply ashamed of my condition, of how I had gotten into it, and\r\nwanted as little fuss made over me as possible and as few witnesses. It was\r\nobvious that I had been set upon and beaten. The policeman, when he brought\r\nme through the door into the parlor, said only that he had found me like this in\r\nthe middle of the Common, but, oddly, no one interrogated me further, not the\r\npolice, not Dr. and Mrs. Howe, and not Father.\r\nAs soon as we were alone, Father stripped my torn clothing off and washed me\r\ndown in placid silence, as if I were one of his lambs and had been attacked by a\r\nwild animal or a pack of feral dogs. Throughout, Father said not a word. Finally,\r\nwhen he had me wrapped in a warm blanket and I was drifting towards sleep, he\r\npeered down at my face as if examining it for further wounds and said, “Owen,\r\ntell me now what happened to you tonight.”\r\n“Is it necessary?”\r\nHe answered that he wished only to know how I came to be walking at night\r\nthrough the woods and fields of the Common, when the place was a well-known\r\nhaunt of hooligans and prostitutes. “Your private business is your own business;’\r\nhe said, “but I pray that it’s not what it looks like.”\r\nI almost wished that it were; it would have been somehow more natural; but I\r\ncould not lie to him. I told him the story of my evening, just as I have related it\r\nnow—of my having passed along the gauntlet of taunts and derision on my way\r\nto the meeting, and of the strange, yet seductive, passivity of the abolitionists as\r\nthey walked through this assault and afterwards at the meeting, and of my slow-\r\nboiling, confused rage, how it eventually drove me from the meeting back to the\r\nstreet and thence into the Common.\r\nFather drew a chair up to my bed, and with thread and needle in hand and my\r\ntorn shirt, sat listening in grim, attentive silence as I spoke through broken lips.",
    "\r\n“I don’t truly know why I went there, though. It was because of what happened\r\nearlier, I suppose. There were all kinds of strange, demented people in that\r\nplace,”I said. “It’s as if the place has been specially set aside for them. I felt like I\r\nwas inside a vast cage with packs of wild animals roaming, and that I was one of\r\nthe animals.” I told him that when a group of them wished me to step aside and\r\ndefer to them, I had attacked them.\r\n“You attacked them?” His eyes opened wide, and he ceased sewing. “Yes.”\r\nHe reached out and set his hand on my head. “You went in there and\r\npurposely attacked this gang of Negro-hating hooligans?”\r\n“Yes. It looks that way. It felt that way, too.”\r\n“Didn’t you realize, son, that they were capable of stabbing you, of killing you,\r\nof simply beating you to death, as they nearly succeeded in doing? Didn’t you\r\nknow that, or are you merely that naive?”\r\n“No, I knew.”\r\n“Yet you went in there anyhow. You went after them.”\r\n“Yes.”\r\nGently he stroked my hair. “I see you freshly, son.” He sat back and looked\r\nsteadily at me. “You have as much of the lion in you as the lamb. In my prayers\r\ntonight, I will be thanking God for that,” he said, and smiled, and went\r\npeacefully back to his sewing, and I to sleep.\r\nThe next morning was a fine, bright day, still unseasonably warm. I woke feeling\r\nbroken, however, in pieces and chunks, barely able to stand, pummeled by a\r\nhundred shooting pains from crown to foot, and feverish. It was Sunday, and I\r\nremember, when Father marched me off to church services, that I was fuzzy-\r\nheaded and dizzy and only dimly aware of what we were up to. I did not\r\nrecognize the streets we passed along, and if Father had told me that we were\r\nnow in Liverpool and I had slept through the crossing to England, I would have\r\nbelieved him.",
    "\r\nAnd before long I did indeed think that I was dreaming, for our reality that\r\nmorning corresponded uncannily to a nighttime dream that I frequently had in\r\nthose years. Father and I were the only white people in a crowd of well-dressed\r\nNegroes. As we moved through the large gathering of black, brown, and tan\r\nmen, women, and children, they parted for us and nodded respectfully, some of\r\nthe men touching the brims of their hats, the women politely averting their\r\ngazes, the children looking at us with surprised eyes—lovely people of all the\r\nmany Negro shades, from pale butterscotch and ginger all the way to ebony and\r\neven a few of that most African hue of blue-black. It was as if every tribe of the\r\ncontinent of Africa, from Egypt to the southernmost tip, were represented there.\r\nFather walked cleanly through the crowd in his usual manner—back straight as\r\na hoe handle, head pitched slightly forward and led by his out-thrust jaw, arms\r\nswinging loosely at his sides, like a man pacing out a field for a survey—and I\r\nstruggled to keep up, my feet heavy and difficult to move, as if I were wading\r\nthrough mud or walking underwater.\r\nSoon the crowd closed around him and filled in between us, and I found\r\nmyself cut off from him, falling further and further back, and suddenly I became\r\nafraid, not so much of the Negroes who surrounded me as of being separated\r\nfrom Father. Like a small child, I cried out to him, “Father! Wait!” At that, the\r\ncrowd seemed to part again and to open up a corridor between us. Father slowly\r\nturned and peered at me. Then, impatiently waving me on, he resumed walking\r\nup the broad steps of a small brick church and entered and disappeared from my\r\nview into the darkness of the sanctuary. The narrow corridor through the crowd\r\nremained open, however.",
    " Laboriously, I made my way along it, sweating from\r\nthe effort and the heat of the day and the many aches and pains of my beating\r\nthe night before, when I had walked another gauntlet, that one amongst white\r\npeople. I was never so conscious as I was then, during those few moments that I\r\nspent traversing the short, paved space at the entrance to the Negro church of\r\nBoston, of the difference between the faces of the oppressors and the oppressed,\r\nor the faces of my white-skinned brethren and my black. And I was never so\r\nconscious of my own bewildering, sad difference from both. My face was\r\ninvisible to me. Father! I nearly cried out. Wait for me! I cannot bear to be so\r\nalone! Without thee beside me, I seem not to exist at all! Without thee to look\r\nupon me, whether I am amongst white people or black, I am invisible!\r\nI found him inside the church, of course, seated in a pew close to the front,\r\nand I took the empty seat next to him, fairly collapsing into it. He studied my\r\nface with sudden concern and felt my brow. “You’re unwell, son|’ he said.\r\n“Perhaps you should have stayed at the Howes’ today.”\r\n“No, no, I want to be here. I’m very happy here, Father,” I said to him. And I\r\nwas. Frightened of nameless things; and filled to overflowing with chaotic\r\nemotions; yet happy! I felt an inexplicable readiness, as if for a religious\r\nawakening, as if for an infusion of light and power. I sensed it coming, not from\r\na truly divine source like Father’s God, but from some other, up to now wholly\r\nunknown source of light and power, which lay outside myself and beyond all my\r\nprevious experiences of awakening, beyond all my earlier resolves and oaths, all\r\nthe sudden stages of my moral growth, all my old degrees and kinds of\r\nenlightenment and the pledges that had followed hard upon them. Filled with\r\ntrembling expectation, then, I waited to become a new man.",
    " Or, perhaps, for the\r\nfirst time, a man.\r\nAnd, indeed, it happened there, on that Sunday morning in September, in the\r\nAfrican American Meeting House on Belknap Street in Boston, Massachusetts.\r\nWhile the choir sang a familiar old Methodist hymn, I began to shake and shiver\r\nand then experienced a great seizure. I remember the beautiful Negro voices\r\npealing like heavy, dark bells, like distant thunder rolling down the valleys and\r\nacross the fields of North Elba, coming closer and closer to me:\r\nCome, O thou Traveler unknown,\r\nWhom still I hold but cannot see;\r\nMy company before is gone,\r\nAnd I am left alone with thee.\r\nWith thee all night I mean to stay\r\nAnd wrestle till the break of day!\r\nThe fingers of both my hands tingled and buzzed, and I believed that the\r\npower of movement had returned to my long-dead arm, and I looked down and\r\nsaw it move unbid, saw it bend at the elbow for the first time since boyhood,\r\nsaw it rise and fall as easily as my right arm, until I was clapping my hands\r\ntogether and swinging both arms like the rest of the congregation and like Father\r\nbeside me. The choir sang, and the preacher, a large, white-haired, full-faced\r\nman the color of mahogany, joined in at the second verse, and the rest of the\r\npeople sang, too, including Father, who knew the words well, for it was one of\r\nhis favorites.\r\nI could not sing, however. I knew the hymn by heart, but it was as if I had\r\nbeen struck dumb. I opened my mouth, and no sound came. In silence, I made\r\nthe words:\r\nI need not tell thee who I am;\r\nMy sin and mis’ry declare;\r\nThyself has call’d me by my name;\r\nLook on thy hands and read it there.\r\nBut who, I ask thee, who art thou?\r\nTell me thy name, and tell me now.",
    "\r\nI did not believe in ghosts then, nor angels nor spirits of any kind, but it was as\r\nif I myself had become one, ghost, angel, or spirit, as if I had been lifted by the\r\nmusic and the clapping and swaying of the congregation and now hovered above\r\nthem all, like a spot of reflected sunlight. Way down below, standing amongst\r\nthe crowd of black and brown people, I saw clearly the two white men, my\r\nfather and his large, red-haired son, swaying and clapping and singing with the\r\nothers. For a few moments, I was split off from my body, entire and yet wholly\r\ninvisible to the others, who sang with a mighty voice:\r\nIn vain thou strugglest to get free;\r\nI never will unloose my hold;\r\nArt thou the Man who died for me?\r\nThe secret of thy love unfold;\r\nWrestling, I will not let thee go,\r\nTill I thy name, thy nature, know’.\r\nAll the universe seemed contained for those moments in that room, and the\r\nroom was filled with music. I watched as my body below began to quake, and I\r\nsaw my head snap back and my eyes roll in their sockets. I saw Father stare at\r\nme with alarm, and when my body stiffened and jerked about as if in a death-\r\ndance, I saw him place his arms around my shoulders to calm and comfort me,\r\nfor he could not know that I was insensible of him and as much at peace as I had\r\never been in my life. I wished that I could reassure him of that, but I could not.\r\nThe standing crowd, intent on its singing and in perfect unison swinging their\r\narms and clapping their hands, appeared not to notice the grimly anxious white\r\nman in the snuff-colored suit and his large, flailing son.\r\nWhat though my shrinking flesh complain\r\nAnd murmur to contend so long?\r\nI rise superior to my pain: When I am weak, then am I strong.!\r\nAnd when my all of strength shall fail,\r\nI shall with the God-man prevail.",
    "\r\nSlowly, I descended and re-entered my body, and it seemed to soften\r\nsomewhat and then to resume its former comportment, and Father eased me\r\nback down into my seat. When I opened my eyes, there he was, looking\r\nearnestly into my face. I smiled up at him.\r\n“Son? Truthfully, now. Have you been brushed by an angel of the Lord?” was\r\nhis whispered question.\r\nI said, “Yes.”\r\nHe let a triumphant smile pass over his face and turned back to the front,\r\nwhere the members of the choir had now taken their seats and the preacher was\r\nmoving towards the altar to begin his sermon. With a great barrel of a voice,\r\nlarge and round, he began. “My children. My brothers and sisters. Let me speak\r\ntoday on this question. Let me ask, let all of us ask, ‘Why should the children of\r\na King go mourning all their days?’“\r\nHe continued, but I heard almost none of the sermon and little of what\r\nfollowed, for I was still be-dazzled; and would remain so for many days and even\r\nweeks afterwards: bedazzled by my new solidity and strength, and by my\r\nwonderful clarity of purpose.\r\nChapter 11\r\nFor Father, the long sea-voyage to England was a splendid occasion for his\r\nexpectations of success to rise steadily. Leaps and bounds, in fact. Solitude, any\r\nkind of extended isolation from the everyday world of petty disappointments and\r\nfrustrations, did that to him—released his fantasies from curtailment and got\r\nhim feverish with mental dramas and schemes, which, with each new day’s\r\ndreaming, he built upon freshly. Dream upon dream he went, quickly\r\nconstructing an immense tower of expectation too fragile to stand against the\r\nfirst opposing breeze and too brittle to bend before the press of mundane reality.\r\nBut there was no holding him back beforehand, no way of warning him or of\r\nforcing him to remember what happened last time.",
    " On a ship at sea for nearly a\r\nfortnight, with no one but the captain and crew and a handful of other\r\npassengers and me to correct him, the Old Man was free to sail, as it were, inside\r\nhis own thrilled mind. And so he did.\r\nThe captain of the Cumbria, Captain Ebediah Roote out of New Bedford, a\r\nsmall, trim cube of a man with Quaker chin-whiskers, wanted only to make his\r\npassengers comfortable and then to forget them and attend to his crew, craft,\r\nand cargo, which were worth so much more to his employers than the comfort of\r\nthe passengers. For this reason, he gave Father permission to conduct daily\r\nprayers and services in the main cabin, hoping no doubt that Father, with his\r\nevident fervor and tirelessness, would organize and sufficiently distract the rest\r\nof the passengers to keep them out from under foot. And, indeed, Father did just\r\nthat, and perhaps as a consequence, at least from the captain’s point of view, the\r\ncrossing for the first eleven days went smoothly.\r\nThe Cumbria was a steam-assisted, two-masted packet of fifteen hundred tons,\r\na small freighter built in the ’30s and renovated periodically since. She provided\r\nfew of the sumptuous diversions and accommodations of the more typical and\r\nmodern passenger ships that crossed between England and the United States\r\nthen. People who chose to travel aboard a freighter like ours were usually\r\nsupercargoes—small-businessmen or their agents accompanying their own cargo\r\n—or poor students and artists traveling on the cheap, or people who did not\r\nwant to be seen by members of their own society. We, I suppose, were\r\npassengers of both the first two types, businessmen, but, like poor students,\r\nwithout cargo, for our shipment of wool had gone before us.",
    " Nearly two hundred\r\nthousand pounds of borrowed Ohio and Pennsylvania wool, it lay ready for\r\nauction to the English cloth manufacturers—seven hundred bales of it stacked to\r\nthe roof and surrounded by hundreds of tons of Irish, Scottish, and Yorkshire\r\nwool in a warehouse in Liverpool.\r\nI remember cringing at the thought of it, almost with embarrassment, certainly\r\nwith dread. Father, on the other hand, contemplated the image with pride and\r\nheady anticipation of a great, hard-earned triumph. “When old John Bull sees\r\nthe quality of our stock, the price of his will drop like a stone, and ours will\r\nrise,” he frequently declared, rubbing his hands together with glee. “And then,\r\nfinally, our greedy New England merchants will find themselves competing\r\ninstead of conspiring with one another. They’ll be up against non-\r\ncollaborationists! Real money-men! After this, they’ll have to pay our price, or\r\nelse we’ll just sell it abroad!”\r\nHow, I asked him, could we be so sure that our wool was markedly superior to\r\nwhat the British grew?\r\n“How? How? We’ve seen the shoddy goods they try to foist off on us poor\r\ncolonials, pitching it to us at prices way above our own. Owen, that stuff’s grown\r\nby peasants!” he pronounced. The Irish and Scottish shepherds were poor and\r\ndemoralized, he explained. They were practically serfs, a conquered, abject\r\npopulation impoverished for generations by a feudal over-lordship. They were\r\nfarmers who couldn’t even own the land they worked or the animals they raised,\r\nand thus they had no more pride in the products of their labor than did slaves in\r\nthe American South.",
    " And off he’d go on an elaborate comparison between the\r\nproducts of slave labor and free, quite as if all the cotton being produced in the\r\nSouth by slave labor were not of sufficient quality to control the world market in\r\ncotton and make the slaveowners richer than Croesus and their senators and\r\ncongressmen powerful all out of proportion to their numbers.\r\nDream on, Old Man, I thought, but said nothing. Scheme on, Father. But even\r\nif you’re right, and the price of English wool drops like a stone because our\r\nproduct is so much more desirable in Liverpool than their own, the New England\r\nmerchants will simply turn around and buy cheap English wool instead of ours,\r\nand the cotton kings of Washington, as soon as they discover it, will vote heavy\r\ntariffs on imports, until the prices are equalized again and the cost of trans-\r\nAtlantic shipping makes the difference, favoring the buyer at home again. A\r\nwasted enterprise.\r\nNone of that mattered to the Old Man, though. To him it was a self-evident\r\ntruth: our wool was superior to the British wool; therefore, the British would pay\r\nmore for it than for their own; and thus, despite the tariffs and the costs of\r\nshipping, we could beat the New England merchants at their own game. His\r\nanger—at the collaborationists, as he called them, and at English feudalism, as\r\nhe saw it, and at slavery and the slave-powered cotton economy, which he\r\nviewed as the root cause of the sufferings of all Northern sheepmen—made him\r\ndeaf and blind. Deaf to me, and blind to the winking smiles of the Boston\r\nmerchants who traveled with us aboard the Cumbria and who were subjected to\r\nFather’s constant explanations of his plans to crack the English woolen market.\r\nBusiness was not his only subject, needless to say.",
    " Every day following\r\nbreakfast, Father sermonized to our fellow passengers, leading his tiny\r\ncongregation in long prayers and hymn-singing and Bible study. Later, he\r\nharangued them on the evils of slavery. His congregants were four Boston\r\nmerchants, a young English journalist, Mr. Hugh Forbes, who said he was\r\nattached to the New York Tribune and was returning to England to visit his wife\r\nand children, and a middle-aged woman and her young female companion.\r\nThese two were an aunt and her niece, going abroad for the senior woman’s\r\nhealth, supposedly, although Father believed that the motives for their journey\r\nhad more to do with the younger woman’s likely pregnancy than the other’s\r\nhealth. It was the journalist, Forbes, who most intrigued Father, for he claimed\r\nto have fought alongside Garibaldi in the recent, failed Italian revolution, was\r\nsupposed to have written a two-volume manual on military tactics, and had once\r\n(or so he said) been a Viennese silk merchant. In Father’s daily reports back to\r\nme in the cabin, the most frequently discussed passenger was Mr. Forbes.\r\nUnfortunately, I was miserable and sick with nausea, with giddiness,\r\nheadache, and vomiting, from the first hour of our crossing to nearly the end of\r\nit, from Boston Harbor to the Irish Sea. It was the first time at sea for me, and\r\nexcept for our return, it would be the last. According to several passengers and\r\nthe crew, who had much experience in these matters, the crossing was a\r\nrelatively calm one; yet I suffered as if we were aboard a small barque upon\r\nstorm-tossed waters, as if we were at sea in a hurricane.",
    "\r\nThere was, of course, an element of convenience in this for me, for it kept me\r\nbelowdecks in our tiny cabin day and night and thus well out of sight and sound\r\nof Father, except when he came to our cabin to report on his day’s activities and\r\nconversations and then to read, pray alone, and sleep, all of which he did no\r\nmore than necessary, as the cabin stank of vomit and my chamber pot, and my\r\ncompany was that of a man curled in his bunk like a cutworm, bloodless face to\r\nthe wall, body wrapped in sweat-soaked sheets, conversation limited to moans\r\nand chattering teeth.\r\nFor a time, Father tried various remedies, some of them suggested by his\r\nfellow passengers and some by Captain Roote himself—drinking warm water,\r\nsassafras tea, herbal potions, eating bits of biscuit, loblolly, and so forth. But\r\nnothing cured me of my sea-sickness, and so, after a few days, I became a\r\npathetic object of the other passengers’ derisive, feigned concern, until gradually\r\neveryone, even Father, seemed to forget that I was aboard or else regarded me as\r\nif I were merely Father’s cargo, out of sight and mind until we landed.\r\nThis did not displease me. I wanted no more than to be left alone with my\r\nthoughts and memories. For it seemed to me then, as it does even now, half a\r\ncentury later, that I was passing out of one life into another. I was like a snake\r\nshedding its skin. There was no single event or insight that had instigated this\r\npainful transition, nor was it the result of careful reasoning and analysis.\r\nCertainly, the three disturbing days and nights in Boston had played a crucial\r\npart, leading as they did to my seizure and apparent conversion at the Negro\r\nchurch, my “awakening.",
    "” But the rapid collapse of our work back in Timbuctoo,\r\nits easy, deadly violence and our inability to stave it off—indeed, the relish with\r\nwhich we all, Father, John, Jason, and I, had taken it up, and then the tragic\r\nand, as it seemed to me, unnecessary death of poor Mr. Fleete—all this mattered\r\ngreatly. And yet somehow, due mainly I suppose to Father’s fervor and\r\nsingleness of purpose, and due also to my ignorance of my own true nature, I\r\ncould not fully acknowledge these experiences or absorb them with\r\nunderstanding. And so I welcomed the chance to re-read them, as it were, in my\r\nmind.\r\nMeanwhile, Father preached to our fellow passengers and the ship’s captain\r\nand crew. Much to their consternation, surely. It may have been the failure of his\r\nwork in North Elba, combined with his fears of financial ruin, but he was\r\npossessed by a sort of mania during those weeks at sea, which must have\r\nfrightened some of his listeners and surely amused others, for he would come\r\nback to our cabin in the evenings and condemn them all roundly for their\r\nmocking refusals to hear him out.\r\nThe merchants, he said, were more attentive and polite, more religious even,\r\nthan the two Transcendental women, as he called them, and the English\r\njournalist, Mr. Forbes. Which was a puzzle to Father, because when it came to\r\nthe question of slavery, it was the women and Mr. Forbes who sided with him,\r\nand the merchants who thought him foolish. “But regardless of their stance on\r\nslavery,”‘ he said, “they all split the Bible off from the Declaration and the Laws,\r\nand in that way they mis-read both. Consequently, every one of them gets away\r\nwith feeling smug and above it all. I don’t understand these people. It’s the Holy\r\nBible that impels us to action, and it’s the Declaration and the Laws that show us\r\nprecisely where to act. What’s the problem with these people?",
    "”\r\nMy response was usually to groan in pain and queasiness and turn my back to\r\nhim and stare at the wall next to my bunk, which seemed to calm him somewhat\r\nor at least to divert his attention and fix it onto the question of my cure. “Will\r\nyou try to eat a biscuit, my boy? Just try a bite of biscuit.”\r\n“I can’t keep it down. I can barely keep down warm water.”\r\n“Shall I sing to you, son?”\r\n“If you wish. Quietly, though, please. My head pounds, and my joints ache.”\r\n“Quietly, then.” And he would begin, in a low and tender voice, one of the\r\nsweet Methodist hymns. A verse or two into it, however, and his voice would\r\nbegin to lift and grow in volume, and soon he was nearly shouting out the\r\nwords.\r\n“Father! My head! Too loud, Father.”\r\n“Of course, son. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, my boy,” he would say, and he would\r\nbegin the hymn a second time, quietly, almost whispering the words now, and of\r\ncourse it was not long before once again he was bellowing it out, obliging me to\r\nwrap my poor head in the pillow, which would cause him finally to cease his\r\nsinging altogether and, not without a sigh to indicate the degree of his sacrifice,\r\nsettle for silently reading from his Bible or in one of his accounts of Napoleon’s\r\ncampaigns, which he was then studying with an eye to making an on-site\r\nexamination after we had completed our business in Liverpool.\r\nWith or without Father, daytimes I confined myself to our cabin. Prompted by\r\nnecessity, however, it had become my habit after a few nights at sea to walk\r\nawhile abovedecks alone late, and I well remember one night in particular.",
    " Long\r\nafter Father had come in, when finally he lay snoring in the upper bunk—from\r\nthe first night out, he had made me sleep below, so as to ease my fits of sickness\r\nand not to wake him when I had to get down and use the chamber pot—I rose\r\nand pulled on trousers and shin; and then, barefoot, my sloshing chamber pot\r\nheld carefully in two hands and extended well before me, pitched my watery\r\nlimbs and turbulent barrel of guts down the narrow, dimly lit passageway and\r\nmade my way up to the main deck. At the stern, I tossed the contents of the pot\r\ninto the sea and returned to midships, where I set the container down by the\r\ncabin passageway and took what had become my nightly stroll, such as it was—\r\na circuit or three, depending on the tolerance of my roiling innards.\r\nOn this night the sea was calm and the breeze light. The squeamishness of my\r\nstomach had somewhat abated, and I was able to look out over the glistening\r\nblack waters without nausea and steady my gaze on the moonlit horizon without\r\ndizziness, and for the first time I actually enjoyed the slight roll and buoyancy of\r\nthe ship below me and the tender flap of the vast sails above, the slosh and creak\r\nof the slowly turning sidewheel. I listened with affection to the groan of the\r\nmasts and spars, the slap of the lines and whir of wooden pulleys, as the wind\r\nluffed and loafed overhead. The quiet, steady plash of the low waves as they met\r\nthe bow seemed almost tropically soft, as if we were in the shallow, warm\r\nwaters of the Caribbee, and for a long moment I quite forgot that I was cast upon\r\nthe broad, fierce back of the old, cold North Atlantic.\r\nThen, as I made my dreamy way around to the leeward side of the ship, I\r\ndiscerned the figure of a fellow passenger, a small, frail-looking woman wearing\r\na heavy, dark woolen shawl over her head.",
    " She clung to the railing there and\r\nstared down into the inky depths as if lost in thought.\r\nWhen I spoke to her, “Good evening, m’am,” she turned abruptly from her\r\nreverie as if startled, and to reassure her I quickly introduced myself by name\r\nand said I was a fellow passenger, the son of John Brown, whom she had no\r\ndoubt already met.\r\n“Oh, yes,” she said. Then, after a long silence, added, “The preacher.” We had\r\nnot yet been properly introduced, due to my illness and persistent reclusion, but\r\nI already knew who she was, of course. I had glimpsed her when we first came\r\naboard in Boston, and later Father had described her at length and had often\r\nspeculated about her condition and reasons for travel.\r\nShe said her name, Miss Sarah Peabody, of Salem, Massachusetts, and held out\r\nher delicate, bare hand, which I grasped in mine for a second. Not knowing what\r\nthen to say or do, I let go of it quickly, as if her hand were unnaturally hot,\r\ninstead of alabaster cool. She seemed wraith-like, more apparition than mortal,\r\nthe image of someone long dead or not yet born, this pale young woman—little\r\nmore than a girl, I saw, when she opened her small, almond-eyed face to me. Not\r\nyet twenty, I thought. And in a dark, sharpened way, she was very pretty.\r\n“Well, Father’s not exactly a preacher,” I finally said. “But, yes, I suppose he\r\ndoes tend to preach to folks. He’s a man of religion, you might say.”\r\nShe smiled lightly. “Mister Brown is an ... impressive man,” she said, with a\r\nhint of mockery in her tone. Her face was intelligent, and though she was clearly\r\na genteel and refined person, she looked straight at me and, despite her fragility,\r\nspoke with mild self-assurance. She was a young woman who seemed sure of her\r\ngifts and their value. A new kind of female, to me.",
    "\r\nI could not imagine her pregnant and abandoned, however—I could not\r\nimagine her becoming pregnant. Even so, there was something about her gaze\r\nand light smile that was not in the slightest virginal, that was bold and\r\nprovocative, and I found myself defending Father to her, as if wanting her\r\napproval of him and, more to the point, of me as well. I told her that my father\r\nwas a businessman, a wholesaler of wool. And that he was also a famous\r\nabolitionist.\r\n“Really?” She arched her eyebrows and smiled more with pity than\r\ncondescension. “A famous abolitionist? Strange that I’ve never heard of him.\r\nAlthough perhaps I should have.” She began suddenly to speak with surprising\r\nanimation. She had thought that she knew everyone of importance who was in\r\nthe movement. She and her family, she said, the Peabodys, were all deeply\r\ninvolved in the struggle to bring an end to slavery and had been for many years.\r\nShe and her family were also active in bringing about other reforms, she said,\r\nwomen’s rights, education, and so on. Except for one aunt, she conceded. Not\r\nher Aunt Elizabeth, the woman with whom she was traveling to England, but\r\nanother, her Aunt Sophia, who was married to an author.\r\n“Poor Aunt Sophia, she follows the Democratic politics and principles of her\r\nhusband. A fine and famous man,” she said, “who ought to know better.” She\r\ntold me the author’s name, Nathaniel Hawthorne. “You no doubt have heard of\r\nhim and perhaps have read some of his tales,” she said.\r\nAt that time, however, his name meant nothing to me. “I’m not much for\r\ntales,” I said. When it came to literary matters, I told her, I was an ignorant\r\ncountry boy, a rough shepherd, whose reading was mostly still shaped by his\r\nfather’s tastes, which is to say, by religion and politics.",
    " Amongst the so-called\r\nmoderns, John Bunyan was our tale-teller and John Milton our poet, and they\r\nwere hardly moderns, were they? The rest, according to Father, was dross, or\r\nworse. Filth.\r\n“Your father;’ she said. “The famous abolitionist.”\r\n“Well, yes,”I said. “But perhaps he’s better known amongst the abolitionists in\r\nSpringfield and out west in Ohio, where we used to live.” I thought for a\r\nmoment to tell her of his association with Frederick Douglass and Gerrit Smith,\r\nbut realized that I would be merely bragging, and besides, it would be as\r\nindiscreet as it was vain for me to invoke the names of those fine men merely to\r\nglamorize Father’s name. Especially in the light of our recent escapades in the\r\nnorthcountry, adventures that neither Mr. Douglass nor Mr. Smith would care to\r\nbe associated with.\r\n“Actually, Father works pretty much alone, and with the Negroes themselves.\r\nNot so much with white people, excepting, of course, us family members. Which\r\nactually enhances his effectiveness, rather than hinders it,” I added, and my\r\nvoice and phrasing sounded in my ears precisely like Father’s, as if he were\r\nspeaking through me, as if, even in chatting casually with this attractive young\r\nwoman, I had no voice or language of my own.\r\n“Well, I’m sure your father is a hero;’ she said to me, and patted my hand,\r\nsoothing a troubled child. “He does seem very much to have cast himself in the\r\nold-fashioned heroic mold. Like one of Cromwell’s captains, the way he presents\r\nhimself. Is he a man of action, as well as a man of religion?”\r\nI could not determine if she was serious or making fun of me, and though I\r\ngrew somewhat shy, I tried nonetheless to engage her bright spirit, which drew\r\nme irresistibly towards her. “Oh, yes, certainly. Action, action, action! That’s\r\nFather’s by-word.”\r\n“A man of action and a man of God! My goodness, what a rare combination.",
    " I\r\ndon’t believe I’ve ever met such a man, at least not until now. And you, Mister\r\nOwen Brown, in matters of war are you his lieutenant, and in matters of religion\r\nhis acolyte?”\r\n“You could say that. Regarding the war against slavery, I mean.”\r\n“Then you, too, are a man of action?”\r\n“Well, less than he. No, not at all, in fact. I suppose I’m a follower.”\r\n“A man of God, then?”\r\n“Less than he there, too. Not at all there, I fear. In religion, I’m not even a\r\nfollower. Although I’d like to be.”\r\nShe said to me then that she thought she and I were much alike, which\r\nsurprised me, for at that moment, no one seemed less like me than this woman,\r\nand I told her so.\r\n“But we’re both attached to people of whom we are but diminished forms,” she\r\nsaid, and at that point there began a most extraordinary conversation between\r\nus. Slowly, we walked the length of the ship and back again, opening ourselves\r\nto one another in a manner altogether new to me. And, as it appeared, new to\r\nher as well, for every few moments she would exclaim, “Heavens, I can’t believe\r\nI’m talking this way to a perfect stranger!”\r\n“I guess it’s difficult to be strangers on a sea-voyage,” I said.\r\n“Yes, and I guess I’m even more lonely than I thought. You don’t mind, do\r\nyou?” she asked.\r\n“No, no, of course not. I’m lonely, too.”\r\nI called her by her given name, Sarah, and she addressed me familiarly, too.\r\nShe confessed that she had come out onto the deck tonight filled with\r\ndespondency and hatred for her life. Everything so far had ended up\r\ndisappointing her, she said. Everything. Despite that, or perhaps because of it,\r\nshe spoke of her illustrious family, the Peabodys of Salem, Massachusetts, with\r\nan admiration that approached awe, even including her Aunt Sophia, the woman\r\nwhose politics she had previously criticized.",
    " Now she described her aunt as\r\nbeautiful and kind and endlessly loyal to her husband, a man who himself was a\r\nliterary genius, she conceded, in spite of his being a Democrat and anti-\r\nabolitionist.\r\nShe contrasted herself with these brilliant and famous relatives: she was\r\nordinary, she said, without their gifts of intellect or speech. And she was in no\r\nsense as virtuous as they. Her family members and their friends and associates\r\nwere, for the most part, rigorous Unitarians and well-known Transcendentalists.\r\nBut for all their liberalism in religion, in terms of their public and private\r\nbehavior they were still old-fashioned, upright Puritans. “In other words, they\r\nare good people” she said. “Morally upright.” Their generation had abandoned\r\nthe Calvinist theology in their youth, but had kept the morality. She, on the\r\nother hand, having been encouraged by her elders since her nursery days to\r\nforsake the old Puritan forms of religion, had retained none of the Puritans’\r\nmoral uprightness and rigor. She was a sinner, she said. A sinner without the\r\ncomfort of prayer and with no possibility of redemption.\r\n“I wonder, Owen Brown, do you think that this is what it means to be all\r\nmodern and up-to-date?” She gave a short, metallic laugh, and, once again, I\r\ncouldn’t tell if she was serious. “Think about it,” she went on. “In spite of the\r\nfact that our lies and weaknesses and our sensualities feel to us exactly like sins,\r\nwe are no longer permitted to believe in sin. It’s absurd!” she exclaimed. She\r\nwent silent for a moment, when suddenly I realized that she was weeping.\r\n“What’s wrong? Can you tell me what’s at the bottom of this, Miss Peabody?”\r\nShe didn’t answer at first, and I regretted my question. Then she sighed and\r\nsaid, “The simple truth is that my life has no meaning to me. It’s true, Owen\r\nBrown. None. I feel guilt, a great weight of guilt.",
    " But no shame!”\r\nI touched her glistening cheek and said nothing. After a moment, I saw in the\r\nmoonlight that she was smiling again. Though it was for me a struggle to follow\r\nthe sudden twists and turns of her emotions and words, I had managed it\r\nnonetheless and believed that I understood her, at least momentarily, for I\r\nthought that I felt the same way as she—about life, about myself, about\r\neverything. Sarah Peabody’s words and her tears and her abrupt and bitter\r\nlaughter had given sudden, expressive shape to my own inarticulated despair.\r\nAlthough despair, like a miasma, had long influenced my mind and spirit—gray,\r\nnoxious, slick, and spreading into every corner of my consciousness—until now\r\nit had remained wordless, unnamed. But here, thanks to this girl, I could name\r\nit. My life, like hers, had no meaning, except as a diminished form of other lives.\r\nFather’s, in particular. And I, too, felt guilt and no shame.\r\n“Then I’m as much a sinner as you, Sarah” I said. “More of a sinner,” I\r\ndeclared, offering cold comfort, I knew. I told her that she wasn’t alone, for I\r\ncould no more believe in the God of our fathers than she. Despite Father’s\r\ntireless wish for me to believe. Thanks to her family’s apostasy, she was\r\nblameless for her fall from religion. But my fall, I pointed out, had been my own\r\ndoing, not my family’s. Then I told her of my “awakening” at the Negro church\r\nin Boston and how my lie had thrilled Father. “It wasn’t wholly an act!’ I said to\r\nher. “I did feel something. But it certainly was a lie to let Father believe that I had\r\nbeen touched by the wing of an angel.” I told her how my lie had sent the Old\r\nMan into a paroxysm of thanksgiving. I was guilty, of course, a sinner, but there\r\nwas no God to punish me.",
    " So here I was, continuing with the charade and feeling\r\nguilty every moment, devouring my guilt as if it were delicious, nourishing food,\r\nbut growing fat and sick with it, as if it were rancid. I told her that I felt like a\r\nman with a need for putrid meat.\r\nShe gently laid her small hand over mine. We were standing again by the rail\r\nwhere I had first seen her. “Oh, Owen Brown, be easy on yourself. Really. You\r\ndon’t know, maybe that is how it feels to be touched by the wing of an angel.”\r\nEven so, she explained, I had only a little lie to live with, and besides, it was a\r\nlie that made someone I loved very happy. My father now believed that his son\r\nwas a Christian. And that, therefore, he had himself a proper acolyte. “It’s a good\r\nlie, Owen. There are such things, you know. Good lies. Even for us lapsed\r\nCalvinists. Don’t abandon it. Keep it,” she said. “For me, I’m afraid, it’s different.\r\nSignificantly different. My lie can’t be kept, and there’s no way for me to\r\nabandon it, or it me. And, worse, my lie makes no one happy.”\r\nThen, to my amazement, she told me the truth about her condition. “I’m\r\nunmarried, Owen, and I’m with child. I’m pregnant. As you may have already\r\nguessed,” she said, but I denied it.\r\nAnother lie.\r\n“What do you think of that?” she asked, looking into my face for the answer.\r\n“Really. Tell me the truth.”\r\nI could not speak at first. Finally, I managed to stammer, “Well... well, yes.\r\nThat’s ... that isn’t right. I mean ... I’m sorry, really, I’m sorry ... ’ stammering not\r\nbecause of any shock or disapproval but because I had not the ready answer that\r\nshock and disapproval would have provided: the politely smiling lie. She saw\r\nthat and seemed pleased.\r\nFor a moment, we stood there side by side at the rail, looking down at the\r\nblack water in silence. Then I said, “Where I’m from, Sarah ...",
    " actually,\r\neverywhere, a man is accountable to a woman and her family. But that... that\r\nseems not to be the case here.”\r\n“No, it certainly isn’t. Seduced and abandoned. Is that how you describe it? I’m\r\na young woman seduced by a cad and abandoned, Owen Brown. A fact soon to\r\nbe visible to all.” She gave one of her small, bitter laughs. “But nothing’s that\r\nsimple, of course. It never is. After all, I loved the man,” she said. Then she\r\nconfessed that she still loved him. She confessed that she had been willingly\r\nseduced. He was in no way a cad, and he didn’t exactly abandon her. And in his\r\nown way, he was as trapped as she. Not by his body, of course, as she was, but\r\nby his circumstances. He couldn’t marry her. Not even if he wanted to. He was\r\nmarried to someone else. Married to a fine, loving woman, in fact, whom she\r\nvery much admired, and he had three beautiful children by her. And he had\r\nbeen as foolish and reckless and cruel to that woman and their children as she.\r\n“But you’re the one who has to pay the price.”\r\n“Yes, I must pay the price. At least publicly. There’s your ‘shame,’ Owen. My\r\nshame. Although it must also be my child’s. But he pays another way. In secret.\r\nHe knows everything that I know, naturally, but he can never say it, can never\r\nstand forth in public and accept responsibility for his sins. He can never be\r\npublically accountable, not without shaming his dear, innocent wife and\r\nchildren, which would only compound his sin. No, he will have to live with his\r\nguilt instead,” Sarah said. And because it was a secret guilt, it would be\r\ncompounded for the rest of his life. His sin was like the pearl of great price\r\npurchased with borrowed money, which he would never be able to pay back.",
    "\r\nSarah’s shame and her child’s reflected shame might actually fade in time—her\r\nsin was public, or soon would be, but sometimes people forget and eventually\r\nforgive. “Especially if we aren’t around to remind them with our physical\r\npresence,” she said. “But his guilt will grow and grow. No one can ever forgive\r\nhim, not even he himself, and he can never forget me. For as long as he lives,\r\nwhether I live or die, I’ll remain the emblem of his sin. I know him well, Owen\r\nBrown. He’s a brilliantly sensitive man, and he makes all the finest moral\r\ndistinctions. He’s practically famous for it.” She suddenly laughed.\r\n“Is he a pastor?” I asked. I could not imagine any ordinary man capable of\r\nseducing this woman. He would have to have been a man of powerful intellect, a\r\nman possessed of a great gift of language, and certainly someone highly\r\nrespected in her society.\r\n“Is he a pastor? A minister?” She smiled evenly. “That’s sweet. He might have\r\nbeen, I suppose. Born too late for that, though. But never mind who or what he\r\nis, Owen. Don’t ask any further. I shan’t tell, and it doesn’t matter anyhow.”\r\n“I’m sorry;’ I said. “I didn’t mean to pry. But I think you’re way too kind to\r\nhim. If I were your father or your brother, let me tell you, I’d deal with the\r\nfellow in a proper way. I’d make him ashamed, all right. A man like that.”\r\n“Owen, no. You don’t understand. No one knows who he is, except me. No\r\none. And the man himself. Oh, he knows! But I’ve told no one: not my family,\r\nnot my aunt, no one. I’ve simply refused, and I never will reveal his name.\r\nNever. It’s the only power I have over him.” She laughed, then was serious\r\nagain. “And remember, I love him, Owen. You must try to understand, I don’t\r\nwant to bring him down. He’s a public man, and I don’t want to ruin his life or\r\nscandalize his marriage or taint the lives of his innocent children.",
    " I’ve done\r\nenough damage as it is. And luckily, except for what I’ve brought upon my poor\r\nmother and father and my dear aunts, most of the damage I’ve done only to\r\nmyself. And to my poor unborn child,” she added, with immense sadness in her\r\nvoice.\r\nI said I supposed she was right. But I didn’t understand.\r\nShe gazed into my face and abruptly laughed. “Really, sometimes I do wish I\r\nwere a man. Look at you! You’re in as much despair over your life as I, yet the\r\nmost important question you have to deal with is how to be a man of action and\r\na man of religion. How to be more like your beloved father. You feel like neither\r\n—you’re not a man of action and not a man of religion—and so you pine away,\r\nlike a poor seduced and abandoned girl.”\r\n“You make me feel foolish.”\r\nBut so much of a man’s life is merely a matter of choice, she declared—the\r\nright choice, the wrong choice. And even if a man makes the wrong choice, he\r\ncan still change it. He simply has to change his mind. “You’re a man, Owen,\r\naren’t you? And, really, when you have good health, you men are your minds.\r\nYou can become a man of action, if you want. Or of religion. Or both. You may\r\nnot end up famous for it, like your beloved father, but you can be it. Tell me,\r\nOwen, isn’t that how it is?” She stared grimly down at the black waves and\r\nclenched the rail with both hands.\r\n“Well, no,” I said. “Or at least it never has seemed as easy as that. Not to me.\r\nBut perhaps I should go in now” I said to her, for she seemed not to be listening\r\nanymore. I believed that I had been dismissed. “I must bid you good night,” I\r\nsaid.\r\nShe looked straight out at the darkness and did not respond. “Miss Peabody,\r\nI’m going in now. I hope ... I hope that we can resume our conversation\r\ntomorrow.”\r\n“Yes,” she said in a thin voice. “That would be nice.”\r\n“Good night, then, Miss Peabody.”\r\n“Yes, good night, Mister Brown.",
    "”\r\nI drew myself away and returned the long way around the bow towards the\r\nstairs that led belowdecks to our cabin, where Father lay snoring in sleep. She\r\nwas right, I knew. My troubles were as nothing compared to hers. And much as I\r\nwanted to believe that my life, my fate, was sealed and that I was trapped as\r\nfully by my character as she was by her pregnant female body, in fact, my fate\r\nwas not sealed, and I wasn’t trapped. For I was, indeed, my mind. As were most\r\nmen. And I could change it. I could simply change my mind, as she said.\r\nI could believe the lie that I had told Father and become, like him, a man of\r\nreligion. Perhaps belief could be willed into existence, just as unbelief could. It\r\nwould not be entirely a lie anyhow, if, like Father, I was obliged to struggle\r\nagainst unbelief and sometimes, perhaps slightly more often than he, failed. Had\r\nhe not, especially as a young man, now and then failed to sustain his faith in\r\nGod?\r\nAnd I could become a man of action as well. In the war against slavery, I had a\r\nwonderful cause, a wide field of worthy endeavor; and in Father I had a fearless\r\nand energetic model.\r\nThe wind had picked up slightly, and the ship had begun to slip and chop\r\nsome, and the sails were snapping and the lines crackling overhead. My nausea\r\nwas edging back. I grabbed up my empty chamber pot where I had left it and\r\nquickly descended to our cabin, and I went at once to my bunk and lay down to\r\nponder these new and important matters.\r\nI remember lying in my bunk the next morning, happily re-visiting the scene of\r\nthe night before and making plans to see Sarah again that day, so that we could\r\npursue the several strands of our conversation further. I was rehearsing\r\nsentences to say to her, repeating them to myself, as if memorizing a poem.",
    " It\r\nwas a gray, blustery morning, and Father had earlier gone above for breakfast\r\nand to lead the daily prayer service, both of which I had begged off, due to my\r\npersistent nausea, which, because of the wind-roughened sea, had worsened\r\nsomewhat.\r\nHe did not return to check on me at his accustomed time, and it was not until\r\nlate in the afternoon that he finally hove into view at the door of the tiny cabin,\r\nholding to the jambs for support against the tossing of the ship. I was lonely and\r\nglad to see him, for we had not spoken when he left, and I wanted to tell him\r\nabout my meeting with the remarkable Miss Peabody.\r\nI had no intentions, of course, of telling him what of her private condition she\r\nhad revealed to me, or of her beliefs and their profound effect on me, but I\r\nthought that he would be interested in hearing about her connections to the New\r\nEngland abolitionists. Actually, I simply wanted to talk about her, to put her into\r\nwords—to think about her in a concrete way, so that I might be emboldened to\r\nseek out her company a second time and then pursue a true friendship with her.\r\nFather sat heavily at the foot of my bunk and placed his Bible upon the narrow\r\nshelf beside him. “How goes it, son?” he asked.\r\n“About the same. Worse since the weather turned” I said truthfully. I lay on\r\nmy side with my knees pulled nearly to my chin.\r\nHe stared down at his hands on his lap and seemed oddly preoccupied. “Can I\r\nget you something to eat? Have you been drinking water? You must drink, son,”\r\nhe said in a low, disinterested way.\r\n“I’ve taken my sips, what I can handle, at least. Nothing to eat, though,\r\nthanks.”\r\nHe sat in silence for several moments, until I asked, “What’s the matter,\r\nFather? Is something wrong?”\r\nHe sighed. “Ah, yes. There is. The girl I spoke of earlier. The one traveling\r\nwith her aunt from Salem?”\r\n“Yes? What of her?",
    "”\r\n“Ah, the poor, distracted thing. She’s gone and thrown herself into the sea.”\r\nI sat bolt upright and stared at him in disbelief. “What? Miss Peabody? No,\r\nthat can’t be true! Not Miss Peabody!” I cried. “How could she do such a thing?”\r\nMy first thought was that I had abandoned her. Then that she had gone off and\r\nleft me behind, that she had abandoned me. All my thoughts were accompanied,\r\nas if prompted, by anger. And all were of myself. I should not have left her\r\nalone. I should have stayed with her the whole night long. I might have\r\nprotected her against the darkness of her mind. I might have been able to keep\r\nher here in this world, for me. I and me.\r\n“Yes, the same,” Father said. “A sad and very disturbing act. I was obliged to\r\npreach a good while to the company this morning. I took my text from Jonah.\r\nIt’s a vexed and anxious company up there today. And the poor aunt, she’s struck\r\ndown with grief for her niece. I don’t understand it. She must have been a bitter,\r\nangry child. I had to struggle just to make sense of it for the others. For her\r\ntroubles, to shade her against the blazing sun of a woman’s troubles, the Lord\r\nGod had prepared her a gourd, and she sat beneath it and no doubt was glad of\r\nit. But when God prepared also a worm that smote the gourd and made it wither\r\naway, she was like Jonah, who wished more to die than to live. Angry as Jonah\r\nin Nineveh was that young woman. Even unto death. You know her name,\r\nOwen. How’s that?”\r\n“I believe ... I believe that you told it to me,” I said, and lay back down.\r\nHe slowly let his breath out. “Yes. Well, I really can’t understand it. Suicide\r\nalways escapes my understanding. Wherefore is light given to her who is in such\r\nabject misery, and wherefore is given life unto the bitter in soul?",
    " Wherefore, to\r\none who longs for death and digs for it more than for hidden treasures, to one\r\nwho rejoices exceedingly and is glad when she can find the grave? Wherefore,\r\nOwen, indeed? She was a pretty, smart young thing, Owen. I liked talking with\r\nher. A little too much educated by Transcendentalism, though. But despite that, I\r\nliked her. She talked right smart to me.”\r\n“Did anyone see her go? When did she do it?”\r\n“Sometime in the night. No one saw. Her bed wasn’t slept in, and when her\r\naunt woke, she sent up the alarm, and the ship was searched stem to stern. But\r\nthe girl was nowhere aboard. Her aunt has collapsed into grief. And regret. And\r\nshame, no doubt.”\r\n“Why? I mean, why regret and shame? She didn’t drive the girl to suicide. A\r\nman did that. A coward.”\r\n“I know, I know, but her niece was in her care, and she seems to have loved\r\nthe girl very much, and now she’ll have to report the sad news back to her\r\nparents in Massachusetts. The man, well, whoever he is, he’ll burn in hell. That’s\r\nfor certain.”\r\n“Maybe she’s still somewhere aboard the ship. There must be places they\r\nhaven’t searched yet. No one came looking for her here, for instance.”\r\n“I vouchsafed this place, Owen. So you wouldn’t be disturbed. No, she threw\r\nherself into the sea, poor child.”\r\n“Horrible.”\r\n“Yes. Horrible. She believed not, and she died in her sins.”\r\nFather went on like that for a while longer, as he often did after preaching or\r\nfollowing a particularly upsetting event, muttering scraps and bits of Bible\r\nafterward, like sparks flaring in a dying fire. But I barely heard him.",
    " I drew into\r\nmyself and tried to shut my eyes against the vision of the young woman\r\ndropping into the black sea, where she is cuffed and rolled and then embraced\r\nby the waves, until she is drawn down by the awful weight of her soaked\r\nclothing, her long, dark hair coming undone and fanning out above her head as\r\nshe descends, her arms extended as if for balance, head thrown back for a last\r\nglimpse of the starry night above, and when she has no breath remaining, she\r\nopens her mouth, and the cold water that surrounds her rushes in and fills her,\r\nand her icy body plunges unresisting through the ocean like a shaft of light.\r\nAgain and again, I tried to wipe the vision from my eyes, to listen to Father, who\r\nwas speaking of Deuteronomy now and the laws of treating with those who\r\nviolate virgins, of the unknown man who had driven this young woman to such\r\nan extremity of despair that she would reject the light that God had given her.\r\nBut his words flew past me like birds.\r\nI hadn’t loved the woman, of course. But I knew that I might have swiftly\r\ncome to that, and thus her death struck me a blow all out of proportion to the\r\nlength of our acquaintance. My pain was like an echo of a cry that I had made\r\nlong years before. Again, I felt not that I had abandoned her but that she had\r\nabandoned me, and somehow, as the hours passed, it did not feel like vanity to\r\nthink that. It felt like anger.\r\nNow I had even more reason to keep to my quarters, and so for the few\r\nremaining days of the crossing I nursed my sickness with hurt and gloom and a\r\ncuriously satisfying kind of mourning—satisfying in that I counted and\r\ncontemplated all those whom I had lost so far in my short life, and in so doing\r\nwas distracted from my nausea and general giddiness. Father came and went like\r\na recurrent dream, and I barely knew whether it was night or day.",
    "\r\nUntil one morning when I woke, and my stomach for the first time seemed\r\nsettled, and I was genuinely hungry. I sat up in my bunk and placed my feet\r\ndown on the deck: the ship felt steady beneath me—although clearly we were\r\nstill at sea and had not yet made land. The waters that carried us had changed,\r\nhowever, as if we had come in off the ocean and were traversing a lake instead.\r\nThen Father appeared at the entrance to our cabin and in high spirits informed\r\nme that we had just passed the Scilly Islands off Cornwall and were coasting\r\nnorth in the Irish Sea, headed towards Liverpool. “We’re in Cromwell’s waters,”\r\nhe said with pleasure. “Imagine that, Owen! Come up and see the headlands off\r\nthe starboard side. You’ll imagine Cromwell’s forces setting off to conquer and\r\nconvert the Irish from paganism and papistry. Celts and Angles, Vikings and\r\nRomans, Picts and Normans—they’ve been sailing back and forth across these\r\nwaters for centuries! Conquering and converting one another for a thousand\r\nyears! It’s wonderful, isn’t it? The mad enthusiasm of these people!” He laughed.\r\nHe kept smiling happily and set about packing our two valises, our small\r\nluggage. “They’re not like us Yankees, are they? We’re a continental people, you\r\nknow; they’re island people. And what a difference that makes, eh? They’re like\r\nthe Fijis and the Hawaiians and those fierce, painted Caribs in their long, sea-\r\ngoing canoes, subduing their island neighbors and then a generation or two later\r\nbeing subdued right back. These days, of course, the Anglo-Saxons are on top\r\nand thinking it’ll last for all time. But you wait: someday soon the rowdy Celts’ll\r\nbe back, and then the Picts. And who knows, maybe the Normans will make\r\nanother run for it, eh? Napoleon nearly did it, and not too long ago.”\r\n“Could be” I said.",
    " “Could be,” I gathered my gear and, after washing my face\r\nand neck and dressing in my one fresh shirt, went up on the main deck to enjoy\r\nthe sight of land. There I saw from north to south a long row of white, low cliffs\r\nand beyond them a strip of cultivated fields, bright green, despite the lateness of\r\nthe season, and overhead a pillowy bank of soft clouds breaking off to a blue\r\nsky. There seemed little more than small fishing villages along the shore; the\r\nship was too far out for me to distinguish individual dwellings. No ports or large\r\ntowns. It was hard to imagine, as Father had, the righteous armies of the faithful\r\nmassing there.\r\nThe salty air was cool against my face. A fair wind blew out of the southwest,\r\nand the wheel churned steadily as a mill, and the sails bellied nicely and helped\r\npush the ship smartly north. Terns and gulls swooped low over the boat, and\r\nseveral of the passengers—bored merchantmen and supercargoes in shirtsleeves\r\nand a grim young man in a frock coat, whom I took to be the atheistic journalist,\r\nMr. Forbes—idly tossed the raucous birds bits of biscuit. The merchants laughed\r\nto see the birds fighting amongst themselves and stealing crumbs from one\r\nanother. The journalist, who watched the men instead of the birds, appeared to\r\nbe sourly proving some other point.\r\nBut like the gulls, I was hungry, and I quickly made my way to the galley,\r\nwhere, although it was long after the hour when breakfast was normally served,\r\nI talked the cook into giving me several slices of hard bread and a portion of\r\n’scouse, salt beef and potatoes and peppers mixed in gravy, and a mug of warm\r\ncider. Sitting myself down in the sunshine on a bulkhead, I ate and drank, and in\r\nshort order I was a new man, ready to come ashore, eager to walk on solid\r\nground again.",
    "\r\nMy melancholy preoccupations had begun to dissipate and scatter like\r\nyesterday’s storm clouds in today’s bright sun, when I saw standing portside,\r\nnext to the rail near the bow, a woman whom I took at once to be Miss\r\nPeabody’s aunt. She was situated exactly where I had last seen my friend, when I\r\ndeparted from her that fateful night.\r\nThe woman looked somewhat beyond middle-age and was large, unusually so,\r\nshaped like a bronze bell, and seemed the picture of solitude and loneliness. She\r\nwore a long, black dress with hat and gloves, and her face was covered with a\r\nblack veil. I could not make out her expression, because of the veil, but she\r\nappeared to be looking back out to sea, gazing in the direction we had come, as\r\nif making her final goodbye to her poor, drowned niece.\r\nI knew that there was nothing I could do or say that would comfort her. It was\r\nsuch a sad sight, and it so threatened to drop me back into my recent gloom,\r\nthat I could not bear to watch her, so I picked myself up and strolled back to the\r\nstern of the ship, to make there my first casual conversations with the sailors and\r\nother men in the crew, conversations and inquiries that, had I not been stricken\r\nwith seasickness, I would have undertaken at the very beginning of our journey.\r\nNow, as we neared our landing at Liverpool, despite the tragic death of Miss\r\nSarah Peabody, and despite my lengthy illness, I found myself in excellent\r\nspirits, healthy and well-fed, newly befriended by cheerful, sturdy workingmen,\r\nand, concerning our business here, fast becoming as optimistic as the Old Man. I\r\nsaw that there had been completed, almost without my intending or even hoping\r\nfor it, a thorough-going transformation in my character and in my relation to my\r\nfather.",
    " The process had commenced in earnest in Boston and had continued\r\nduring the crossing and now, somehow, inexplicably, it seemed to have been\r\ncompleted by the sad, wasted death of the young woman Sarah Peabody—all\r\naccomplished, for the most part, without my awareness or understanding. Until\r\nit was over, that is, when—by remembering who and how I had been before,\r\nespecially in relation to Father—I realized that I had become, in an important\r\nsense, a new man. No more the disgruntled, sulky boy who followed his Old Man\r\naround and waited for orders that he could resent. No more the pouting,\r\nconflicted ape. This new fellow, who had been a reluctant follower, was now an\r\nenthusiast, was a proper lieutenant, was a fellow believer! He might fail here\r\nand there—fail to act, fail to believe—but he would no longer question his\r\naspirations or his commitment.\r\nThus I fairly bounced down the gangplank ahead of Father as we disembarked at\r\nthe crowded quay on the Mersey River, where the Cumbria had docked and was\r\nalready being unloaded by husky lumpers and stevedores and loaded onto carts\r\nand wagons by teamsters. It was a noisy, chaotic hub-bub of a scene: hawkers\r\nand higglers in tiny stalls, men in tall beaver hats on horseback and in carriages\r\nmaking their way through the crowd, ragged beggars on crutches with hands\r\nheld out, a musician in a harlequin’s suit with a monkey on his shoulder and a\r\ndancing dog on a string, and meandering gangs of urchins and skinny men in\r\ncaps who looked like cutpurses; there were merchants, clerks, supercargoes, and\r\nshipping agents ticking off goods received and goods about to head out, and\r\nshirtless, orange-haired Irishmen lugging barrels and crates. Here and there, a\r\ndistinguished-looking gentleman or lady arrived by carriage to greet a visitor or\r\ncollect a parcel.",
    " People called and bawled to one another and sometimes\r\ngrabbed my sleeve and tried to sell me food off their smoking carts: greasy, fried\r\nfish wrapped in paper, roasted potatoes, bits of meat on skewers; and old ladies\r\ncarrying trays filled with jellied sweets accosted me at every turn; everyone was\r\nshouting at me, it seemed, but I understood barely a word I heard. Their\r\npronunciation and the speed with which they spoke was all off. It was as if I\r\nwere not in an English-speaking country at all, or as if I myself did not speak\r\nEnglish. There were Negro men working alongside the whites, and Hindoos with\r\nturbans, and bearded men in black coats and hats whom I took to be Jews. There\r\nwere tall, blond, white-skinned Swedes and florid Russians and even a few in the\r\ncrowd whom I recognized as Americans, long-faced Yankees in black, and\r\ntanned Southerners with walking sticks and broad hats and pale suits. I felt that I\r\nhad arrived in Phoenicia.\r\nThe buildings were high and looked ancient, mostly of gray stone, and the\r\ncrooked alleyways and streets between them seemed narrower and smelled more\r\nof old food, beer, and human waste than Boston even. But there was a\r\nremarkable increase in human activity here, more noise, more color and variety\r\namong human types, than in Boston, which delighted me and seemed to please\r\nFather, too, for he had a small smile on his face as we pushed through the throng\r\nand made our way from the hurly-burly of the quay to the huge stone warehouse\r\nwhere he had arranged for our wool to be stored pending our arrival and now to\r\nbe examined and graded and, presumably, sold.",
    "\r\nWhile I stayed in the dimly lit warehouse and inventoried our nearly two\r\nhundred thousand pounds of wool and made sure that none of the bales that\r\nFather, John, and I had so carefully graded, labeled, and shipped from\r\nSpringfield had been damaged or come undone in transit or storage, Father\r\nretreated to the office with the purveyors’ agent, a Mr. Pickersgill, to set a time\r\nfor the buyers to view Brown & Perkins’s wonderful American wool. A pimpled\r\nteenaged apprentice watched over me suspiciously, as if he expected me to steal\r\nour own wool. All six hundred ninety bales of it, neatly packaged in burlap and\r\ntied with heavy cord, had been stacked in a bay near the rear of the huge, cool,\r\ncavernous building, and after I had examined and counted every one, I proudly\r\nsigned the slip the boy had handed me—Received in good order by Owen Brown,\r\nagent for Brown Perkins, Springfield, Mass., U.S.A.—and admired for a moment the\r\ntidiness of our bales, comparing them to the rough-looking stock that surrounded\r\nours and rose in heaps nearly to the high, dark eaves, theirs, all of it, sloppily\r\nand irregularly packaged and tied. Then I picked up my valise and went straight\r\nout to the street, there to loll in the sun and admire the passing crowd.\r\nIt looks good for us, I thought. The Old Man was right. These British are no\r\nmatch for us.\r\nSoon Father emerged from the warehouse, blinking in the bright light like a\r\nmole, but looking pleased with himself and eager to move to the next piece of\r\nbusiness, which I assumed was finding lodgings. “Turns out we’ve arrived a day\r\nlate for the weekly viewing and sales,” he said. It would be six days before the\r\nbuyers from Manchester, Leeds, and the other cloth-manufacturing towns\r\nreturned to Liverpool to examine the wool that came in during the week and\r\nmake their bids according to grade and quality.",
    " “So, my boy, we have a bit of a\r\nholiday in front of us;’ he said, and he rubbed his hands together in a show of\r\npleasure. “What d’ you say we take it?”\r\n“What do you propose?”\r\n“Well, let’s just keep moving! Here we are, like Father Abraham sojourning in\r\nthe land of promise, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob. We are\r\nstrangers and sojourners here, as were all our fathers. Am I right?”\r\n“Right! So where do you propose we go?”\r\n“Why, to London! And to the very continent of Europe! We’ll track Napoleon’s\r\nhundred days’ march, all the way from Elba to Waterloo!”\r\n“We’ve only got six days for marching, Father,”I pointed out. “Not one\r\nhundred. And we have to end back here, not Waterloo.”\r\n“And so we shall.” He laughed and clapped me on the shoulder, and we\r\nstepped down to the cobbled street and joined the flow of the crowd heading\r\ninto the heart of the city. He had learned from Mr. Pickersgill, the warehouse\r\nclerk, that if we hurried to Garston Street at Speke Hall, we could catch an\r\novernight post-chaise to London. The train had already departed. “Let’s go now!”\r\nhe said. “It’ll cost us less anyhow to sleep in a moving rattler than a bed in a\r\nboarding house that goes nowhere.”\r\nI had no money of my own, naturally, so wherever Father went, there close\r\nbehind, of necessity, came I. As if I were in his employ, his apprentice boy. And\r\nin a sense, of course, I was. But I did not mind any longer thinking of myself that\r\nway, since our goals were now the same. After all, had I money of my own, I\r\nwould have done just as he—I would have taken a holiday, ducked into a shop\r\non the way for bread and cheese and a sack of shiny red apples, and made for\r\nthe night coach or a rattler to London and beyond. Who knows, I might even\r\nhave gone to Waterloo.",
    "\r\nChapter 12\r\nThis was the first time that I had been out of my native land, and therefore the\r\nfirst time that I’d walked the streets of a country where slavery had been\r\nbanished, and I felt cheerfully liberated by it. England was then, as now, of\r\ncourse, an antique monarchy, not a modern republic. Nevertheless, it was a freer\r\ncountry than ours, for no man could legally buy and sell another, and for that\r\nreason alone, as soon as we stepped ashore, the air we breathed seemed cleaner,\r\nfresher, more energizing, than ours at home. I think Father felt the same\r\nexhilaration as I. We did not speak of it to one another, however—it was as if we\r\nwere superstitiously afraid to say the words “Negro” and “chattel”\r\nand”slavery,”as if we both knew that merely to utter the words in passing would\r\ndrop us back into the gloom and rage that we then associated with being citizens\r\nof the United States of America. We needed a holiday, a vacation from the\r\nobligation to be constantly conscious of our national shame, and when it came,\r\nwe both took it with unaccustomed alacrity.\r\nOur high spirits did not diminish, even when we discovered, to our surprise\r\nand my slight displeasure, that our fellow passengers in the post-chaise from\r\nLiverpool to London were Mr. Hugh Forbes, the English journalist, and Miss\r\nElizabeth Peabody, from the Cumbria. But we did not raise the topic of Negro\r\nslavery with them, either; we did not say the hated words. Nor did they,\r\nprobably because they had already heard enough on the topic from Father\r\nduring the crossing and did not need or particularly want to hear more. Instead,\r\nall of Father’s comments and observations were limited at first to remarking on\r\nthe passing scenery and then to interrogating Mr.",
    " Forbes on the recently ended\r\nwars in Italy, on military tactics, and on the ideas and principles of the leader of\r\nthe failed revolution, the famous Giuseppe Mazzini, whom Mr. Forbes, a man of\r\nnumerous small pomposities, claimed to have known personally.\r\nThe vagueness with which he answered Father’s questions made me suspicious\r\nof his claims, but Father seemed eager to believe them, and when in private,\r\nduring a brief mail-stop outside Manchester, I whispered my suspicions to the\r\nOld Man, he just waved me off and explained that Mr. Forbes talked elusively\r\nand vaguely because he was British. “They all talk that way, Owen,” he\r\npronounced. “It’s a national trait. They’re a very circumspect people, y’ know.\r\nThink of Shakespeare,” he said. I did, and still did not agree, but said nothing\r\nmore.\r\nMiss Peabody, whom Father had described earlier as “a voluble woman with\r\nmany sharp Transcendental edges,” was quite obviously still stunned by the\r\ndeath of her niece and kept to herself, as was natural. I had mumbled my\r\ncondolences, as soon as I realized who our veiled fellow passenger was, but\r\notherwise we men deferred to her in silence and tried not to intrude upon her\r\nprivacy and grief. Even Father left her alone, although I knew he would have\r\nenjoyed leading her in prayer for the salvation of her niece’s unsaved soul. He\r\nbelieved, as the Bible showed, that God was sufficiently powerful and merciful to\r\nbreak His own rules from time to time and, if sufficiently prevailed upon with\r\nprayer, might be willing to admit a fallen suicide into paradise. But, for once, the\r\nOld Man politely restrained himself.",
    "\r\nFor me, it was exceedingly difficult not to speak to her of Sarah Peabody, to\r\ntell the woman of my brief encounter with her niece on the very night of her\r\ndeath, for I was no doubt the last person to have seen her alive and to have\r\nspoken with her at length. Not that I could have told the aunt anything\r\nconsoling. Still, I might have said that her niece had touched my heart with\r\nunusual force and had moved my mind in a significant way. I might have said\r\nthat my brief meeting with her had unexpectedly clarified my thoughts and that\r\nI would remember her for the rest of my days, as indeed I have.\r\nBut our spirits, mine and Father’s, were soaring, despite my distrust of Mr.\r\nForbes and our constant awareness of the suffering of Miss Peabody. Not even\r\nthe shocking sight at dusk of the sooty mills of Manchester and the blackened\r\nhovels of the thousands of laborers whose lives were given over to the mills\r\ndampened our enthusiasm and curiosity. The crimes evidenced by these\r\nmonstrous, huge, prisonlike factories were English crimes, not American; and the\r\ngreed that drove the mighty engines of the mills and the owners’ callous\r\ndisregard for the lives devoured in their service were English greed and\r\ncallousness, not American; and as we passed through the city, the raggedy,\r\nexhausted, vacant-eyed men and women and pathetic small children whom we\r\nsaw wending their way along the narrow streets from the mills to their teeming\r\ntenements were English, Scottish, and Irish workers—not a one of them\r\nAmerican.",
    " It was a luxurious detachment that we enjoyed as we crossed this\r\nbenighted land, and though it was but a respite, I could only hope that we had\r\nearned it, Father and I, and that our inability when in America to disassociate\r\nourselves from the sufferings of our Negro brethren, our constant anguish,\r\nshame, and rage when at home, had purchased this brief holiday honestly and\r\nfairly.\r\n“This is a fine country, isn’t it, Owen?” Father said, peering out his window at\r\nthe passing villages and farms. He commented on the scenery as if we, his fellow\r\npassengers, could not see it, which was his habit anyhow, although it was\r\nsomehow not so noticeable to me in America as here. “Their farming and\r\nstonemasonry are very good, Owen. But look, their cattle are generally only\r\nmore than middling good, I would say. And on average their horses, at least\r\nthose I’ve seen so far, bear no comparison with those of our Northern states,\r\nespecially. The hogs look healthy and slick, though, wouldn’t you say? And the\r\nmutton-sheep are almost as fat as their porkers.”\r\nSoon it began to rain, and then it grew dark, and our world was reduced to the\r\ncramped interior of the coach. While I tried intermittently to doze and Miss\r\nPeabody, as it appeared, gloomily meditated on the death of her young charge,\r\nFather drew Mr. Forbes forward into a discussion of military tactics, which\r\nrambled on into the night. Mr. Forbes did seem to know his subject, however,\r\nwell enough at least to speak convincingly about the ways and means of training\r\nand maintaining a small, disciplined, easily deployed force of insurrectionists so\r\nthat it could effectively oppose a much larger, slower-moving, national army.\r\nThis was, of course, the very subject the Old Man was most interested in\r\nhearing about, and he quickly warmed to it. I knew that he was transposing\r\neverything Mr.",
    " Forbes said, which mostly concerned the failed wars in Italy, into\r\nvictory on an Appalachian landscape in the American South, and that, in\r\nFather’s mind, Mazzini’s ragtag army of republicans was a rapidly growing force\r\nof freed and escaped Negro slaves and a few courageous whites, a citizens’ army\r\nbroken into small bands operating from thickly forested mountains, fighting\r\nmostly with weapons seized from the enemy and living off the land and goods\r\nand foods donated by secret sympathizers, darting down from their mountain\r\nhideouts under the cover of darkness to make lightning-like raids against the\r\nlowland plantations, liberating the slaves there and steadily enlarging their\r\nforces with the able-bodied African men and women willing to join the fight,\r\nand sending the others north along the great Subterranean Passway, as he called\r\nit, all the way up the chain of mountains from the Appalachians to the\r\nAlleghenies to the Adirondacks, on to the home base in Timbuctoo and thence to\r\nCanada.\r\nMr. Forbes was a slender, talkative man in his middle thirties, with a high,\r\nbalding head and dark, wavy hair, which he kept long and combed across the\r\ntop in a vain attempt to hide his baldness, although it shone through\r\nnonetheless. He had the chalky complexion of a man not used to outdoor work,\r\ndark, deep-set eyes, a long, aquiline nose, and he wore a drooping moustache.\r\nHis teeth were not good, but, withal, he was a handsome man and intelligent-\r\nlooking, if in a delicate, slightly effeminate way, as when now and again he\r\nwinced at the rising volume of Father’s voice and looked somehow pained, as if\r\nembarrassed, when the coach crunched over a stone or dropped into a narrow\r\nditch and tossed him in his seat.\r\n“I suppose some things seem obscure, Mister Brown, but really, they’re quite\r\nobvious, aren’t they?” said Mr. Forbes.",
    " “Once they’ve been pointed out, of\r\ncourse. Either by genius before the fact or, as is more often the case, after the\r\nfact by disaster. Don’t you think so?” He had a habit of pausing in his statements\r\nand briefly admiring his fingernails, then going on. “For instance, Mister Brown,\r\nhere’s some after-the-fact wisdom, if you like. Taken from the Italian campaign.\r\nTaught by disaster.” The smaller force, he said, had of necessity always to be\r\nmade of men who, though they believed many things, must believe but two.\r\nNumber one, each soldier must believe that he is engaged in a struggle in which\r\nhe and his comrades are morally right and their opposition morally wrong. No\r\nmiddle way. No room to negotiate a compromise. It couldn’t be a simple dispute\r\nover land. Basic principles, not mere borders, must be at stake. And number two,\r\nhe must believe that he is fighting for his own life and for the lives of his loved\r\nones. So that the only imaginable alternative to his participating in this dreadful\r\nwar is death for him and his loved ones. No going home for a season to harvest\r\nthe olives and the grapes. “Give me liberty or give me death,” Mr. Forbes said,\r\nsmiling. “That sort of thing. A bit like your American revolution, wouldn’t you\r\nsay? It helped, of course, that you were lucky. And had brilliant leadership, I\r\nmust say. Brilliant. At a time when ours was inept. Lovely. For you, I mean.”\r\nMr. Forbes did not seem particularly to like the brave Italian soldiers he was\r\ndescribing or even to admire the great Giuseppe Mazzini. Like many of the\r\njournalists whom I came to know later, during the Kansas War and afterwards,\r\nhe seemed to feel himself superior to his subjects and affected a cynical and\r\namused detachment towards them.",
    " This didn’t bother Father, apparently, or else\r\nhe simply didn’t notice it, which worried me, as Father continued to interrogate\r\nthe man and appeared at times to confide in him certain plans and intentions\r\nwhich I thought were better left secret. I would turn out much later to have been\r\ncorrect in my estimation of the character of Mr. Hugh Forbes, for, as is well\r\nknown, he joined us as an ally late in the Kansas campaign and then at a crucial\r\nmoment afterwards became one of our chief betrayers and nearly brought us\r\ndown. For now, though, and even right up to the point of his betrayal, he was to\r\nFather a man possessing much valuable knowledge, and the Old Man meant to\r\nuse him. I sat and watched and listened. And whenever I thought the Old Man\r\nwas going too far, or coming too close, I interrupted him and led them to a\r\ndifferent aspect of the topic, for I could not get him off the topic altogether.\r\nThe rain poured down, and the coach sloshed roughly forward towards\r\nLondon. The leather curtains flapped and slapped against the sides, and now and\r\nthen a fine spray of water entered the dark interior, wetting us. Father asked Mr.\r\nForbes, “I’m wondering, how, sir, would you be able to discipline and train such\r\nan insurrectionary force? You can’t go out and conscript soldiers and drill them\r\nin public and instruct them and so on. You have to operate in secret and in small\r\nnumbers. Especially in the beginning.” No matter how much your soldiers shared\r\nthose two essential beliefs—that in the face of outrageous wrong they were\r\nmorally right, and that they were fighting for their and their loved ones’ lives—\r\nthey still were not professional soldiers, after all. Most of them would be\r\nunskilled laborers, he pointed out to Mr. Forbes.",
    " Our recruits, he explained,\r\nwould be people who were likely to be illiterate, unused to military machinery\r\nand weapons, untrained in distinguishing between occasions that require\r\nindependent action and those that require submission to authority. And they\r\nwould be people who had been taught for generations to hold themselves\r\nbeneath the very men they were now opposing.\r\n“Is this theoretical, Mister Brown?” drawled Mr. Forbes. “Or are you planning\r\na revolt?”\r\n“Father,” I said into the darkness, cutting him off. “Isn’t it like Gideon and the\r\nGileadites? In the war against the Midianites. Remember?”\r\n“Ah! So it is! So it is! There’s your answer, Mister Forbes. My son knows what\r\nyou do not, sir. That the greatest military manual ever composed is the Holy\r\nBible! Properly construed. And he’s quite right, the answer to my question is in\r\nfront of my eyes. For the Lord said unto Gideon, ‘Whoever is fearful and afraid,\r\nlet him depart early from Mount Gilead.’ And twenty-two thousand men\r\ndeparted from the mountain, leaving behind ten thousand who were not\r\ncowards. And the Lord said, ‘There are yet too many.’ Too many! Imagine! Not\r\ntoo few. And the Lord conceived of a test for Gideon to put to the remaining\r\npeople, such that all those who went down on their knees to drink were\r\nseparated out, and there were then but three hundred remaining, only those who\r\nhad put their hand to their mouth when drinking, the men too proud to go down\r\non their knees even to drink from the river Jordan. And the Lord said unto\r\nGideon, ‘By these three hundred men will I save you and deliver the Midianites\r\ninto thine hand.’\r\n“And here, Mister Forbes, the Bible is very instructive in a most particular and\r\ninteresting way!’ Father went on.",
    " “Gideon, who this time was instructed by his\r\ndream, divided his three hundred men into three companies of one hundred\r\neach, and according to the dream, he himself would lead one company only, and\r\nthey would go to the camp of the Midianites at the beginning of the middle\r\nwatch. Very useful instructions, when you think about it. The beginning of the\r\nmiddle watch. Smart, eh?”\r\n“Considering that it came from a dream,”Mr. Forbes said in a low voice.\r\nFather ignored him. “And Gideon ordered each man to carry in one hand a\r\ntrumpet and in the other a lamp lit inside a pitcher, and on hearing Gideon’s\r\nown trumpet they were to break the pitcher and hold up the lamp and blow\r\nupon the trumpet and cry out, ‘The sword of the Lord!’ so as to look and sound\r\nlike ten times ten thousand. ‘The sword of the Lord!’ And when they did that,\r\nMister Forbes, all the hosts of the Midianites who were not slain at once by the\r\nsword of the Lord fled into the wilderness!”\r\nI heard Mr. Forbes utter a loud yawn. “Amazing,” he said.\r\n“Yes. If your General Mazzini had looked more deeply into his Bible,” the Old\r\nMan went on, “he might in the end have triumphed over his enemies.” When\r\nMazzini had wanted to know how to cut off his enemy’s supplies, Father\r\nexplained to Mr. Forbes, he should have read 2 Kings, chapter 19. And for\r\nsetting ambushes, he might have consulted Judges 9, verse 34, where he would\r\nhave been told to lie in wait against Sechem in four companies, or else divide\r\ninto two companies, as did Joshua against Ai, and lead the enemy out of its\r\nfortress by having one company pretend to flee, and then the second company\r\ncould enter the fortress and set it afire, and when the men of Ai saw that their\r\ncitadel was in flames, they would turn and rush back to save it and would be\r\ncaught in the open plain between the two companies of Joshua and cut to pieces.",
    "\r\nAnd to know how to slay an enemy chieftain who is surrounded always by his\r\nguard, Father said to look into Judges 3,19—25, and go to your enemy as Ehud\r\nwent to Gilgal and say that you have a secret errand to him from the Lord, and\r\nwhen Gilgal has sent away his guard, thrust your dagger with your left hand into\r\nhis belly to the haft, so that the fat will close upon the blade and he cannot draw\r\nit out and only the dirt will come. Then go forth and lock the doors upon him\r\nand escape unto Seirath.\r\n“Indeed,” Mr. Forbes said. “With your left hand, eh?”\r\n“Oh, yes! Facing him! Because of the placement of the internal organs, the\r\nliver and the bowels and so forth,” he explained. “So he’ll die at once and not\r\ncry out.” For some time Father continued showing Mr. Forbes the brilliance of\r\nthe Bible as a military manual, citing chapter and verse from a dozen different\r\nbooks, and I felt that his listener must surely have fallen asleep, for he no longer\r\nspoke. I, of course, had heard the Old Man employ the Bible this way hundreds\r\nof times before on any number of topics, from the care of sheep to the\r\nmanagement of grief, and had myself fallen asleep in the middle of his citations,\r\nto waken in time for the grand peroration at the end and nod agreement. This\r\nwas how the Old Man talked, how he communicated his thoughts and beliefs,\r\nand it could be pretty impressive, because he knew his Bible better than any man\r\nand could apply it with intelligence and verve and sometimes, perhaps without\r\nintending it, even with humor.\r\nThis time, however, I heard him differently. For it was clear, as he laid out one\r\ncase after another, that he did indeed know more about military tactics and\r\nstrategy than Mr. Forbes, his presumed expert, and probably knew more than\r\nGeneral Mazzini, too.",
    " He was drawing on the experience of a people who had\r\nconducted wars large and small for thousands of years. Never mind that they\r\nclaimed to have received their instructions from the Lord, from dreams, or even\r\nfrom the entrails of birds; Father’s great knowledge of the Bible gave him direct\r\naccess to the experience of a thousand generations of military men and women,\r\nproviding him with the collective memory of an entire race of people. Father\r\ndidn’t read the Bible like a man who thought he was like the ancient Israelites,\r\nhe read it as if he were an Israelite himself, as if he, too, were receiving\r\ninstructions from the Lord. The man did not simply remember the Bible, as a\r\nperson remembers the alphabet or even as he remembers old injuries or\r\ntriumphs. No; for the Old Man, the Bible was his memory.\r\n“Well, Mister Brown, that’s all very interesting,” said Mr. Forbes. “But I’m\r\nafraid the modern military mind requires a bit more than the Bible for its\r\ninstruction. Times change, don’t they?”\r\n“Ah, but human beings don’t!” Father exclaimed. “And, unfortunately, one of\r\nthose things that do not change is the very belief, the delusion, if I may say so,\r\nwhich you have just now uttered, that human beings change. That, too, is\r\nconstant, my friend. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our\r\nlikeness.’ Times may change, sir, but the Lord does not, and therefore neither\r\ndoes he who was made in His image, for changelessness is in the nature of Him\r\nwho hath made us. We are the same man as old Adam was.”\r\n“Indeed. Well, I’m afraid I’m not a religious man,” said Mr. Forbes. He then\r\nannounced his desire to sleep, promising to resume this most interesting\r\nconversation in the morning before reaching London.",
    "\r\nFather said fine, fine, he too would like to sleep, and so would we all, Miss\r\nPeabody especially, he added, although she had said not a word in several hours\r\nand must indeed have been lost in her dark thoughts, quite unconscious of\r\nFather’s and Mr. Forbes’s conversation and unlikely to sleep, regardless of her\r\nfellow passengers’ consideration or lack of it. She did not acknowledge Father’s\r\nremark, nor did I, and so we all fell into silence.\r\nThrough the long night we made our bumpy, rain-chilled way, catching short\r\nnaps as we could, stopping briefly for breakfast at an inn outside the village of\r\nDunstable, a ways north of London, and made the vast capital city proper shortly\r\nbefore midday. Several times, the Old Man tried picking up his discussion with\r\nMr. Forbes where they had left off, but the Englishman seemed reluctant to\r\npursue it further and smiled condescendingly and put him off, as if he thought\r\nFather slightly cracked. I had seen that response in people many times before,\r\nhundreds of times, in fact, and I had almost always felt sympathy for them, even\r\na little pity, with anger at Father mixed with embarrassment for myself. But this\r\ntime I felt merely superior to Mr. Forbes and dismissive. He was too closed-\r\nminded, too conventionally educated, or perhaps simply too stupid, to\r\nappreciate the Old Man’s originality and clarity, I thought.\r\nYou did not have to be a Christian to see that Father’s insights into the nature\r\nof man were brilliant and that his principles were admirable; in fact, it probably\r\nhelped if you were not a Christian, for many of Father’s views significantly\r\ndeparted from those held by the modern churchmen. You did, however, have to\r\nlook at things afresh, as if no one had ever asked your question before. How does\r\none conduct an ambush? How does one assassinate an enemy chieftain?",
    " How\r\ndoes one oppose a large, well-trained professional army with a small, ragtag\r\nforce of angry civilians?\r\nIn every case, the Old Man simply answered with another question: How is it\r\ndone in the Bible? Unlike most Christians, Father did not go to the Bible merely\r\nto confirm what he wished to be the case, whether about man or God; he went\r\nthere to inquire what was the case. And where better to look after all? Where\r\nelse had the nature and doings of man and God been more closely observed over\r\na longer period of time than in the Bible?\r\nIn London we did not tarry, and I barely had a glimpse of the city. Which I\r\nsomewhat regretted, as it was the hugest conglomeration of people and buildings\r\nthat I had ever seen or imagined, and I would have liked to take its measure, if\r\nnothing else. It consumed fully an hour for our coach to make its way from the\r\nedges of the city to the center. All those crowded, twisted, narrow streets and\r\nmaze-like lanes lined with brick warrens and tiny, dark hutches—it was a\r\nliterally dizzying sight, and I staggered when I stepped down from our coach to\r\nthe street! The sky was but a thin, gray satin ribbon zig-zagging overhead, and a\r\nlight mist drifted down from it upon us, making us shine like smooth, wet stone\r\nand giving everything a strange, heightened clarity. I wanted to walk off into the\r\ncity, to leave the others behind and wander aimlessly, utterly anonymous and\r\ninvisible in such a crowd.\r\nBut perhaps it was just as well that Father was so intent on getting to the\r\ncontinent of Europe, for it would have taken me months, even years, to gain\r\nsufficient perspective on the city and its thronged enormity to know where in it I\r\nstood at a given moment. I could see and wonder only at what was directly in\r\nfront of me and had no way of knowing its relation to the rest. My viewpoint\r\nwas all foreground, no background.",
    "\r\nFather’s was also, but this seemed not to bother him. From the instant that we\r\nstepped all stiff and damp from the coach to the cobbled street, he was busily\r\narranging our departure for Belgium. Before bidding goodbye to our fellow\r\npassengers, however, he took Mr. Forbes aside and obtained from him both his\r\nLondon address and his address in New York, which he wrote into his pocket\r\nnotebook. He then said that he would soon be contacting Mr. Forbes personally\r\nor would be sending one of his agents to speak with him in strictest confidence\r\nconcerning a matter of grave importance and utmost secrecy. The agent would\r\nlikely be one of his sons and would identify himself as such by recalling certain\r\ndetails of our voyage.\r\n“You’re quite serious, aren’t you?” Mr. Forbes said. He stood, carpetbag in\r\nhand, his weight carefully balanced on one foot, the other nearly in the air, as if\r\nhe were ready to run.\r\n“I am, indeed, sir. I believe that I will want you for an ally in some business\r\nthat I am planning. You have certain experiences and knowledge that I may have\r\nneed to draw upon.”\r\n“I thought the Bible was all you needed.”\r\nThe Old Man smiled slyly. “Perhaps the Bible has told me that I need a man\r\nlike you at my side. Just as Abraham, to free his brother Lot from Sodom,\r\nneeded the Canaanite chieftains.”\r\n“Ah, yes. Abraham. Very well, then,” he said. “You are an interesting man,\r\nMister Brown, and I believe you bear watching. And as I am a journalist, I shall\r\ndo that. Shan’t I?”\r\n“Just so,” Father said, and shook his hand firmly.\r\nWhen Mr. Forbes had gone on his way, the Old Man turned to Miss Peabody,\r\nwho stood beside a heap of suitcases, her own and, I assumed, her niece’s. She\r\nappeared to be waiting for a carriage. Father said, “Is there any way I can help\r\nyou, Miss Peabody?",
    "”\r\nShe politely answered no, that she had hired a porter and would be on her way\r\ndirectly to her hotel.\r\n“My son and I would both once again like to express our sympathy to you.”\r\nShe said, “Thank you, Mister Brown” and turned pointedly away from us,\r\nleaving Father’s hand hanging in the air and mine just behind it.\r\n“Goodbye, then,” he called to her. “Goodbye! I will pray for your relief from\r\nsorrow!”\r\nShe did not answer, and we moved off from her. “I believe I offended her\r\nearlier,” Father said in a low voice. “With my persistent sermonizing aboard the\r\nship.”\r\n“Never mind. It’s her niece who needs your prayers.”\r\n“Yes, yes, you’re right. Of course. But I do go on sometimes. I forget myself’\r\nI said to Father, “Speak to me about your conversation with Mister Forbes.\r\nReally, what do you need him for?”\r\nHe smiled, as if relieved not to think about the Peabody women and the\r\nsometimes ticklish business of his enthusiasm for prayer and sermonizing. “Wal,\r\nmy boy;’ he drawled, “as the man himself said, he is a journalist. And though he\r\nis atheistic, he is sympathetic to our cause.”\r\n“But he’s not an American. He’s English.”\r\n“All the better. Americans are always readier to believe foreign reports on our\r\naffairs than they are the homegrown variety. Don’t you think?” he said,\r\nmimicking the Englishman’s accent. He laughed and grabbed up his valise and\r\nsaid, “Come on, m’ boy, we’ve got to catch the very next train to Dover! Enough\r\nof these hard English coaches, eh? We can do it, if we hurry. We’ll be on the\r\nother side of the English Channel by nightfall!”\r\nWe had disembarked at King Street near the Covent Garden Market Hall, and\r\nit was only a short walk to the station at Charing Cross, which was located on a\r\nwide boulevard called the Strand.",
    " Father strode along in his usual straight-\r\nlegged fashion, led by his chin, and I scrambled to keep up, distracted by the\r\npassing crowd, by the elegantly coiffed and bustled women in their long dresses,\r\nthe gentlemen with their canes and silk hats, the fine, high-wheeled carriages\r\nand tall chaises with liveried drivers and footmen and the handsome matched\r\nteams that drew them through the jammed streets.\r\nThe over-abundance of visible wealth, power, and suave self-assurance amazed\r\nme. This, I thought, is the other side of those smoking factories and the hovels\r\nwe saw in Manchester and the other towns, where children collapse and die\r\ndaily at their machines. And this is the visible profit produced by the terrible\r\nsugarcane plantations in Jamaica and Barbados, where slavery has been replaced\r\nby serfdom. The whole country seemed like a single, huge factory, whose raw\r\nmaterials and labor were fed into it from the barren hills of Ireland and Scotland\r\nand from distant tropical plantations. Liverpool was its shipping dock and\r\nLondon its counting house. I could not imagine myself as a member of the ruling\r\nclass, one of these grand men and women passing me on the street;\r\nconsequently, I thought that if I were an Englishman living in England, I would\r\nsurely be one of those old Luddites, smashing machinery with hammers. And if I\r\nlived in one of the colonies, I would be like those old Maroons under Cudjo,\r\nescaped slaves living up in the mountains and slipping down to the plantations\r\nat night to set the cane fields on fire. In some countries, I said to myself, the only\r\nlife you can properly desire is that of destroyer.",
    "\r\nSo on we went to Europe itself, hurrying east by train to Dover and by ferry boat\r\nto Flanders, and then by train again, click-clacking our way across green, marshy\r\nWalloon country to Brussels, and thence by foot, as the early morning mists rose\r\nfrom the meandering streams of Brabant, out the Charleroi road to the farm\r\nvillage of Waterloo, where a generation earlier the greatest armies and generals\r\nof Europe had hurled themselves against one another, settling in smoke and\r\nblood, once and for all, or so we believed back then, the fates of half the nations\r\nof the world. We knew nothing of what was coming after, of course; little\r\nenough of what had gone before. I was there that day merely because Father had\r\nled me there—Hurry, hurry, hurry!—and he had come to Waterloo because he\r\nwanted to see how, just when Napoleon was about to win it all, he had lost\r\neverything.\r\nI was beginning to understand the Old Man’s obsession with Napoleon and\r\nWaterloo. For a long while, it had seemed little more than another of his passing,\r\nerratic distractions, his characteristic way of not thinking about a thing that\r\npained him, a practice that he was periodically inclined to indulge in, especially\r\nin times of stress, usually financial. Sometimes familial, of course. Sometimes\r\npolitical. But these wayward interests of his rarely lasted longer than the\r\nparticular period of stressfulness, and as soon as the pressures on him eased a\r\nlittle, as they always did, he would return to his two great, permanent, ongoing\r\nobsessions—religion and the war against slavery.\r\nThis interest in Napoleon and Waterloo, however, had lasted longer than it\r\nshould have. His expectations of financial success in the English wool market\r\nwere now realistic, it seemed, and the pressures ought to have lifted.",
    " For the first\r\ntime in years, he could think about wool and money without wincing in pain,\r\nwhich should have brought him straight back to slavery and religion. He did not\r\nhave to think any longer about Napoleon—the greatest man of the century to\r\nmost people, even to most Americans, but to John Brown, one would have\r\nthought, an evil genius, a small Corsican puffed up with delusions of imperial\r\ngrandeur, a man whose vanity and shocking ambition had been responsible for\r\nthe death and mutilation of hundreds of thousands of men at arms and the\r\npermanent impoverishment of millions of civilians. Father had no love for\r\nCaesar, and even less for those who, like Napoleon, wished to emulate him, no\r\nmatter how brilliantly they waged war or how much adored they were by their\r\nfollowers.\r\nThat very morning, before leaving for the battlefield, I had asked him directly\r\nwhat was so wonderfully attractive about Napoleon. We were eating our\r\nbreakfast, smoked fish and bread and cheese and rich, creamy milk—how clearly\r\nI remember that rough, fresh Flemish food! We were seated at a bench-like table\r\nin a roadside tavern a short ways outside the bustling, large market-town of\r\nBrussels, where, on our arrival late the night before, we had taken lodgings. We\r\nspoke no French, of course, nor any other European language, so Father had\r\ncompensated by much pointing and by shouting in very slow English to the\r\nwaiters, station attendants, and hotelkeepers, as if they themselves spoke English\r\nbut did it badly and were hard of hearing. He managed to make himself\r\nunderstood, however, but only because our wants and needs were simple and\r\nobvious.\r\n“I know that Napoleon’s an important man,” I said to him, “especially here, to\r\nthe Europeans. But really, Father, what’s he to us Americans, except a sort of\r\ncynical, power-hungry humbugger?",
    " In a democracy, a man like that would be\r\nsuccessful only on the stage, or he’d be put in prison early.”\r\nFather laughed. “Or hed run for senator from New York. And probably win it,\r\ntoo.”\r\n“I’m serious. Why do you admire him so?”\r\n“Admire him, Owen? I loathe him! However brilliant a military man he was,\r\nhe was nevertheless an atheistic monster, an egotistical dictator of the first rank.\r\nWhen he was finally declared dead on his little island of Saint Helena, while all\r\nover the world people wept, I cheered.”\r\n“Then why are we here?”\r\n“Well, to put it simply, I want to understand why he lost. And this one battle\r\nmade all the difference.” It was Bonaparte’s hundred days’ march, Father\r\nexplained, his final, mad plunge back into Europe from Elba, that intrigued him.\r\nNot that he was so successful, storming back from exile the way he did. Father\r\nsaid he would have expected that. It was a supremely intelligent move, with\r\npredictable results, once he made it. Except for his loss at Waterloo—that was\r\nnot predictable. No, what intrigued and puzzled Father was that after such a\r\nsuccess, which shocked and terrified all of Europe, in the end Napoleon failed.\r\nFor future reference, Father explained, he wanted to know if Napoleon’s defeat\r\nat Waterloo was due to a tactical blunder or to the superiority of Wellington and\r\nBlikher, the Prussian. Or did his own generals, the Frenchmen Ney and Grouchy,\r\nbetray him? No evidence for that. Was it cowardice? Not likely. Too much\r\ncaution? Highly unlikely. Too little? Perhaps. Regardless, it was important to\r\nknow.\r\n“You expect to learn that,” I said, “here, now ... what is it? Nearly forty years\r\nafter the event?”\r\n“Ah, my boy, sometimes you can only smell out these things in person.",
    " When\r\nyou walk the very ground of the history you’re investigating, when you sniff the\r\nair, check the light, glance sideways and over your shoulder, when you pick up a\r\nhandful of the dirt and crumble it between your fingers, you can learn things\r\nthat no history book can ever teach.” Besides, he pointed out, the English\r\nhistorians all want to celebrate Wellington, so they tell that version of the story,\r\nand the Prussians are touting Blücher, and the French are intent on selling\r\neveryone on either Napoleon’s grandeur or the legitimacy of Louis XVIII. The\r\nOld Man frankly didn’t care who or what was won or lost here. “I’m an\r\nAmerican” he said. “I want only to know why he failed.”\r\n“Yes,” I said, “but why do you need to know this? What’s it got to do with\r\nyour plans?”\r\nIt was those one hundred days, he explained. One hundred days—from\r\nNapoleon’s unexpected departure with a half-dozen faithful lieutenants from the\r\nisland of Elba, where he’d been exiled, to his arrival here at Waterloo three\r\nmonths later with a quarter-million armed men at his command. “That’s what\r\nit’s got to do with my plans,” he said, smiling, and he got up from our table and\r\nmade for the door. “Let’s get going, son!” he called. “We don’t have a hundred\r\ndays. As you said. We’ve only got this one!”\r\nThe battlefield was a huge, rolling, hillocky expanse of low grass, like an\r\nenormous cemetery without markers, criss-crossed by soft, overgrown ditches\r\nand low ridges and bordered in the distance by a dark line of yew trees, with\r\nsquared-off, small fields beyond, where local farmers in blue smocks and short\r\nspades made the fall turning of their soil by hand. When we first arrived at the\r\nbattlefield, the dew was barely off the grass, and I followed the Old Man from\r\nsite to site, while he counted off steps, as if he were surveying the land and I\r\nwere his assistant lugging the chain.",
    " Marking the advances and retreats, first of\r\nWellington’s forces and the Flemish infantry, then those of his Prussian\r\ncounterpart, General Blücher, and the several French armies, Father seemed to\r\nhave memorized the battlemaps, for he knew the exact positions of all the armies\r\nthat had met here that June day in 1815, and he walked straight to them and\r\npaced off the distances between their lines.\r\n“The ground all along here” he said, “where it slopes down to the plain, there,\r\nwas soppy and wet. Yes, yes,” he said, squinting down the field. On the night of\r\nthe seventeenth, when Bonaparte arrived from Ligny, the Old Man explained, the\r\nground was soft from two days and nights of rain, and then it stopped raining,\r\nand he waited until eleven the next morning. Up on the heights there, he said,\r\npointing. Then, before marching against the Belgians and the Dutch, he waited\r\nfor the ground to dry. That was important, the Old Man said—said to himself,\r\nactually, not to me. That was a crucial delay. It gave Wellington time to dig in\r\non the opposite heights, Mont St. jean they called it, barely a hill, but a good\r\nredoubt, if Wellington was given the time to fortify it.\r\nFather strode abruptly down the long, grassy slope, to check the soil, I\r\nassumed, so as to determine how muddy it must have been at eleven A.M. on\r\nJune 18,1815, while I lagged behind and watched from the ridge. The sun had\r\nrisen to above the hilltops behind us, and the day was growing hot, the air heavy\r\nwith moisture. Making my way across the vast expanse of the battlefield, I came\r\nin a short while to a low grove of trees where a narrow stream wandered\r\nthrough.",
    " Here I took a seat in the shade beneath the trees, removed my hat, and\r\nleaned back against the friendly trunk of one and watched Father off in the\r\ndistance, as he marched straight-legged uphill and down, counting out the paces,\r\nthen stopped, peered around, touched the soil, scratched his chin, and,\r\npondering for a moment, turned on his heels and marched off in a new direction,\r\ncasting himself first as the entire army of one side and, a few minutes later,\r\nturning himself into the army of the other.\r\nIt was an amusing sight, and certainly he must have looked peculiar to the\r\nlocal farmers who were here and there working in the fields adjacent to the\r\nbattleground—this lean, middle-aged man in a dark coat with flapping tails and\r\na flat-brimmed hat set straight on his head, striding in geometrically precise\r\nlines beneath the hot, mid-morning sun over hill and dale, at meaningless points\r\nabruptly stopping and wheeling, pausing briefly with chin in hand, and suddenly\r\nputting himself on the march again. And while I myself was no more capable of\r\nactually seeing the things he saw out there than were those curious Flemish\r\nfarmers who leaned on their spades and gazed after him, nonetheless I knew\r\nwhat he saw and heard and even smelled.",
    " I knew that he was deliberately,\r\nthoughtfully, with impressive, detailed knowledge, situating himself at the\r\nhundreds of points where the armies of six nations had met, and that he now\r\nwalked in the midst of a thunderous battle, heard the angry shouts and pitiful\r\ncries of thousands of men falling face-first into the dirt and dying there\r\nstraightway, saw the fire and smoke of long rows of cannon and the screaming\r\nhorses going down and heard the crash of huge wagons and machines breaking\r\napart, as wave upon wave of men marched suicidally against high walls of\r\nmusketry, slashing sabers, blazing pistols, pikes, and daggers, until the lines\r\nbroke and bloody hands reached out and grasped the throats of terrified, wild-\r\neyed boys and men—farmers, artisans, and simple workmen fleeing for their\r\nlives, while all about the field human limbs were heaping up, arms and legs and\r\nheads severed brutally from the trunks, leaving howling, bloody mouths at the\r\ncut ends and the trunks cast down like so much meat, and the living, those who\r\ncould still rise, staggering forward, covered with dirt, blood, feces, vomit, as\r\nbehind them the corpses stiffened in the watery ditches and swelled and started\r\nto stink in the heat of the June day, and behind the corpses, up on the ridge, the\r\ngenerals plotted their next assault.\r\nI sat on a hill in the shade of a tree, like one of the generals myself, and\r\nwatched my father track and translate a series of elaborate, invisible runes in the\r\ndistant fields. I watched a man controlled by a vision that I, his son, was too\r\nroughly finished to share, a vision that he would be obliged, therefore, to come\r\nback and report to me, just as he reported back to me his vision of the Lord. I\r\nbelieved in his visions, that they had occurred, and that they were of the truth—\r\nthe truth of warfare, the truth of religion.",
    " This was what I had learned the night\r\nthat I spoke with Miss Peabody aboard the Cumbria—her last night on earth\r\nand, in a sense, my first. I had changed my mind that night, as she had\r\ncommanded, and forthwith had changed my self. In making my mind up, I had\r\nmade my self up. And for the first time, the only necessary time, I had decided\r\nsimply that my father’s visions were worthy of my belief. The rest was like day\r\ncoming out of night. I would remain, of course, a man made of ordinary stuff,\r\nand on my own had nothing else to work with. My great good fortune, however,\r\nwas that my father was more of a poet than I, was a seer, and was perhaps a\r\nprophet. He was a man who saw things that I knew must be there but could not\r\nsee myself, and because I loved him and trusted him, and because of the power\r\nof his language and the consistency of his behavior, my belief had swiftly\r\nbecome as powerful and controlling, as much a determinant of my mind and\r\nactions, as Father’s belief was of his. In this refracted way—though I remained\r\nuntil the end his follower and continued to live with no clear plan of my own\r\nand no belief in God—I became during those days for the first time a man of\r\naction and a man of religion. The difference between us, between me and my\r\nfather, is that I would inspire no one to follow me, either into battle or towards\r\nGod, whereas he had me, and soon would have a dozen more, and finally whole\r\nlegions and then half a nation, following him.\r\nIn the evening, after a supper of mutton that the Old Man much admired, we\r\nstrolled until dark about the town of Brussels, and Father related to me his\r\nfindings. We walked to the heart of the town and came out upon an ancient,\r\ncobblestoned market-square, where the town hall was located. There we admired\r\nfor a while a large medieval statue of St. Michael trampling the devil under his\r\nfeet.",
    " The statue had been placed on a spire atop the tall building, and to observe\r\nit we were obliged to stand at the furthest point in the square, our backs to a\r\nstone wall, peering up, as if watching an eclipse. Pronouncing the statue useful,\r\nFather declared it the sort of thing we ought to have more of in American towns.\r\n“It’s a Catholic statue, though” I pointed out.\r\n“No, it’s older than that. You don’t have Catholics until you have Protestants.\r\nNo, it’s a Christian statue.”\r\n“And America is a Christian nation.”\r\n“It is, indeed,” he said. “Or ought to be. It was surely meant to be.” We moved\r\non then, and soon Father returned to the subject of Napoleon. All of Napoleon’s\r\nreasons for being defeated at Waterloo, he stated, came down to his having lost\r\nthe element of surprise. For three straight months, up to and including the time\r\nhe arrived with his armies at Ligny and drove Blücher’s Prussians from the field,\r\nBonaparte had done the thing that was least expected of him. For that reason\r\nalone, all other things being equal or nearly so, he had come away victorious.\r\nBut when he decamped at Ligny and moved on through the rain, he arrived at\r\ndawn at Waterloo, where he discovered that between his army and Wellington’s\r\nsomewhat exposed and approximately equal force, there lay a half-mile of\r\nmarshy meadowland. Here, for the first time, he did the expected thing. He\r\npulled up and waited for the sun to dry the field. That gave Wellington time to\r\ndig in and, as it turned out, time for Blücher’s regrouped Prussians to arrive from\r\nLigny. There was no way Napoleon could have defeated the Allies after that. For\r\nhe had not done the unexpected thing. When Blücher arrived, it was nearly noon,\r\nand as the battle had just commenced, he was able to re-inforce Wellington’s\r\narmy. That made all the difference.",
    " First, the element of surprise had been lost,\r\nand now things were no longer equal. Napoleon had to lose. Mathematics,\r\nsimple numbers, had taken over. Certain victory was turned into a rout. For\r\nNapoleon, it was the end of his campaign, the end of his war, the end of his\r\nhundred days. There was nothing left for him now but retreat, eventual\r\nsurrender, exile, the restoration of the monarchy in France, and a return to the\r\nstatus quo in the rest of Europe.\r\n“What should he have done, then?”\r\n“He should have done whatever Wellington least expected him to do. Which is,\r\nfirst of all, to attack. Attack at once.” And not only should he have attacked at\r\nonce, Father went on, for the mud would have hampered Wellington’s army as\r\nmuch as his own, but he should have split his force into two equal-seeming\r\nparts. “Like Joab against the Syrians and the children of Ammon,” he explained.\r\n“One part would be made the superior, however, the way Joab secretly placed\r\nthe best men of Israel under his command and placed the rest, an inferior lot,\r\nunder his brother, Abishai.” Then Napoleon should have attacked from the two\r\nflanks, not to make a pincers, but to make two separate fronts, so as to force\r\nWellington to divide his army into two parts also. Except that in Wellington’s\r\ncase, the two would not have merely seemed equal, like Napoleon’s. They would\r\nin fact have been equal. Consequently, Napoleon’s secretly superior half would\r\nhave quickly overrun the British half opposing it. And his inferior portion over\r\non the other flank would have triumphed also, because Wellington’s side would\r\nhave broken and run when they saw their opposite flank taken by a force\r\napparently equal to the force facing them. “Just as the children of Ammon, when\r\nthey saw the Syrians broken by Joab’s army of the best men of Israel, fled from\r\nthe inferior force under his brother, Abishai.",
    " Napoleon’s greater false-half, in\r\ndefeating Wellington’s actual half, would be handing victory like a gift to his\r\nlesser half. Thus his army as a whole would have defeated Wellington’s as a\r\nwhole, and Blücher, arriving six hours later, would have been obliged to beat a\r\nhasty retreat back to Prussia. Napoleon would be emperor once again. He might\r\nstill be emperor today.”\r\nWe turned off the square onto a wide avenue and walked on, and while I\r\npondered Father’s findings and tried to apply them to his own planned campaign\r\nagainst the slaveholders of the American South, he whistled contentedly a\r\nfavorite hymn and now and then paused to admire and comment upon the grand\r\nhouses and impressive palaces of the town.\r\n“It’s a valuable lesson, then?” I said.\r\n“What is?”\r\n“Your discoveries concerning Napoleon’s defeat.”\r\n“Yes, of course. We mustn’t ever forget it. There will come a time, Owen, I\r\npromise you, when we will be cut down—unless we do the unexpected thing.”\r\n“When will that be? When’s it coming?”\r\n“Soon;’ he said. “Sooner than anyone thinks.” He seemed then to drift off, as if\r\nobserving future events with as much clarity as earlier today he had viewed the\r\npast. But a moment later, he abruptly returned and said, “First, however, we’ve\r\ngot some business in Liverpool to attend to! We’ve got to sell some Yankee wool\r\nto our British cousins, my boy, and at a price that’ll free us of debt, once and for\r\nall. I’m sick of living like a toad under a harrow!”\r\n“Right!” I said, and laughed aloud. Not because of his figure of speech, but\r\nbecause it seemed so incongruous to be meditating one moment on warfare,\r\nancient and modern, and the next to be planning strategy for the sale of wool. I\r\ncould hardly wait for the day when we would no longer have to think about\r\ncommerce and could bend all our energies and attention to war! War against the\r\nslavers!",
    " “I wish we could rush straight into battle now!” I exclaimed.\r\n“Ah! So do I, son;’ he said, smiling. “So do I.” And he walked on, hands\r\nclasped behind his back, head slightly bowed, as if it were the Sabbath and he\r\nwere on his way to church.\r\nTwo days later, we arrived back in Liverpool and at once made ready to show\r\nour wool to the Englishmen. The morning before the auction was to take place,\r\nwe came down bright and early from our lodgings to the warehouse, so as to be\r\non the scene when the agents for the cloth manufacturers examined all the\r\nsheepmen’s stock and set in their own minds how high they would bid later. This\r\npractice was a guard against being victimized by puffers, men who were\r\nsometimes secretly hired by the sheepmen to bid the prices up, and was, of\r\ncourse, when the prices for the various grades of wool were actually established\r\nand agreed upon among the buyers. It was no different here than in the United\r\nStates, where there was a considerable amount of secret collusion between the\r\nbuyers, most of whom had elaborate, long-term business dealings with one\r\nanother, such as previous debts or deals, services owed or promised, goods with\r\nliens attached, and so on, often concerning some business quite other than that\r\nof purchasing wool and in some other city. Thus the auction itself was more or\r\nless a formality; there were seldom any surprises, and prices rarely moved up or\r\ndown more than a fraction of a cent per pound.\r\nIn Springfield, for number 2 grade wool, before Father had withdrawn his\r\nentire stock from the marketplace to ship it abroad, Brown & Perkins had been\r\noffered, and had turned down, thirty-five cents a pound. Number I had been\r\ngoing for forty-one cents. The three higher grades, X, XX, and XXX, had been\r\npriced proportionally higher.",
    " Father’s plan was to obtain in Liverpool a price of\r\nforty-five to fifty cents per pound for the number 2, low enough to undercut\r\nslightly the current English price, and to scale the other grades accordingly.\r\nAfter subtracting shipping costs and tariffs, he figured that he would still come\r\nout ahead by at least ten cents per pound, a net gain of twenty thousand dollars\r\nover what he would have gotten for the same wool in Springfield. Furthermore,\r\nas he had explained to me numerous times, by withdrawing Brown & Perkins’s\r\none hundred tons of wool from the domestic market, he had created an artificial\r\nshortage there, which would force the prices up for a time, and thus he would\r\nprofit twice, here and now in England and next month in Springfield, when the\r\nfall fleeces arrived from the western sheepmen.\r\nFather had me pull half-a-dozen bales of number 2 from different layers of our\r\nlot and haul them out onto the floor. This was normally a two-man job, but in\r\nthose days, despite my crippled left arm, I was strong enough to handle a two-\r\nhundred-fifty-pound bale alone by grabbing it on top with my right hand and\r\nhooking the bale underneath with my left and slinging it up onto my right\r\nshoulder. If it was tied correctly and I had a strap, I could even lug it with one\r\narm, like an enormous burlap-wrapped satchel. “Stack them over here, son,”\r\nFather said, pointing to a place a short ways off from the others, so that our\r\nwool stood out from theirs.\r\nI think that Father wished to make a bit of a show for the British gentlemen,\r\nwho lounged about the cavernous space in several small groups, chattering idly\r\namongst themselves, most of them in fine suits and silk cravats, affecting canes\r\nand wearing gloves and tall hats.",
    " We stood out anyway, due to our rough\r\nclothing and Yankee speech and manners, but the image of honest American\r\nyeomanry was perhaps what Father wanted to put on display, nearly as much as\r\nthe wool from Brown & Perkins of Springfield, Massachusetts, and I wasn’t\r\ndispleased to play my role, the tall, strapping lad who tosses around two-\r\nhundred-fifty pound bales by himself.\r\nOur counterparts, the British sheepmen, stood by their sample bales with caps\r\nin hand, silent, eyes cast down, as if they believed they were in the presence of\r\nlofty personages, feudal lords and squires, instead of scheming merchants.\r\nFather, by way of contrast, leaned against his stack of bales almost casually and\r\nwhittled with his pocketknife on a stick he’d cut from the hedge by our boarding\r\nhouse and had brought along, I now realized, for precisely this somewhat\r\ntheatrical purpose.\r\nSoon a group of four or five buyers with slight smiles on their faces had\r\ngathered near us, examining our persons more than our bales of wool, all the\r\nwhile continuing to talk amongst themselves, in their drawling, nasal, English\r\nway, of their club dinner the previous evening. Then several more of the\r\nsanguinarians sauntered over, their walking sticks clicking across the warehouse\r\nfloor, and soon there was a crowd surrounding us, looking bemused and a little\r\nbored. If they were impressed by who or what we were, they disguised it.\r\nThe clerk of the works, Mr. Pickersgill, a small man with a malmsey nose and\r\nDutch spectacles, whose task it was to organize the sale and with whom Father\r\nhad dealt on our arrival, came quickly out of his office and joined the group and\r\nnervously began to speak for us, as if we were Iroquois Indians and could not\r\nspeak to these fine gentlemen for ourselves. “This ’ere’s Mister John Brown from\r\nthe firm of Brown and Perkins. It’s a big lot ’e’s got, sirs.",
    " Some seven ’undred\r\nbales at various grades. Hammericans he declared, as if it were the name of our\r\ntribe.\r\n“Indeed,” said one. “From Pumpkinshire!”\r\n“Extraordinary,” said another.\r\n“I like your cravat,” said a third, a short, platter-faced fellow with an outsized\r\nhead and a limp blond moustache. He removed one of his fawn-colored gloves\r\nand reached forward and tweaked the piece of soft leather that Father\r\ncustomarily wore at his throat, causing Father to cease his whittling at once and\r\npull himself up straight and glare at the man, until he withdrew his hand and\r\ndelicately wiped it with a handkerchief and replaced the glove.\r\nThere were several low har-hars from the group. Father resumed his whittling\r\nand said, “When you wish to examine my wool, gentlemen, please inform Mister\r\nPickersgill, and I’ll be glad to show it to you.” He briefly stated that he had\r\nbrought close to one hundred tons of clean, graded wool, all of it raised by\r\nexpert sheepmen in the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and that his number 2\r\nwould prove superior to their X and equal to their XX, although he would price\r\nit to compete with their number 2.\r\nThere were a few snuffles of disbelief, and one of the Englishmen asked him\r\nwho had graded his wool. “More to the point,” he said, “who cleaned it?” and the\r\ncompany laughed, for it was unfortunately true that American wool was\r\nnotorious in those days for not being clean, and a hundredweight of fleece might\r\nhave as much as twenty pounds of dirt and feces stuck in it. This had been one of\r\nFather’s ongoing concerns, making sure that Brown & Perkins wool was clean,\r\neven for the domestic market, where the practice of folding trash in with the\r\nfleeces was all too common. From the beginning of his and Mr.",
    " Perkins’s\r\nSpringfield enterprise, Father, although only a middleman, had made a great\r\neffort when purchasing the wool in the west to teach his shepherds how to wash\r\ntheir sheep thoroughly before shearing and how to pick the wool clean before\r\nshipping their clips to him in Springfield. His lectures on the subject at fairs and\r\nshows where he demonstrated his methods were famous among the sheepmen\r\nfrom New England to Ohio.\r\n“Gentlemen, I have purchased every clip of this wool from shepherds I’ve\r\ntrained personally. It’s been sheared from sheep whose stock I’ve improved with\r\nmy own purebred merinos and Saxonys. And I myself am the man who has\r\ngraded this wool. I’ve graded it, and my own sons and I have examined it before\r\nshipping for cleanliness.” This was not exactly true, for it was impossible to\r\nexamine closely two hundred thousand pounds of wool. One graded it by taking\r\na single handful of fleece from each shepherd’s clip, and one sampled clips at\r\nrandom to check for dirt and hoped that the shepherds were as good as their\r\npromise to deliver clean wool. Which, for the most part, they were. Besides,\r\nFather could generally estimate two hundred fifty pounds of clean wool by\r\ncasting his eye over its volume.\r\n“An expert, then,” said one of the Englishmen, a tub-bellied fellow with a\r\nyellow waistcoat stretched to its limits. “We have us an expert. He grades his\r\nown wool!” he said, turning to his fellows and smiling like a catfish.\r\n“I am an expert, when it comes to grading wool. I’ve made it my business for\r\nnearly forty years, man and boy. Too many cunning shavers out there,\r\ngentlemen. Too many trimmers. Not enough honest men, like yourselves. But\r\neven so, a sheepman would be a fool not to know how to grade his own wool.”\r\n“And you’re no fool, eh, Yank?” called one.\r\n“Gentlemen,” Father said, heating up, “I can grade wool in the dark.”\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n“Aye.",
    " Blindfolded.”\r\n“Extraordinary!”\r\n“I can read a clip blind, from a single tuft,” Father declared, truthfully, for I\r\nhad seen him do it hundreds of times.\r\nThe short man with the broad face and blond moustache then stepped forward\r\nand removed his own necktie, a blousy piece of fawncolored silk that matched\r\nhis gloves, and held it out to Father. “Perhaps you’d like to demonstrate,\r\nMister... ?”\r\n“Brown. Be glad to,” he said, and he passed me his knife and stick, removed\r\nhis hat, and tied the scarf around his head, blocking his sigh t.\r\n“No help from you now, my fine golumpus,” the man said to me, and he\r\ndeparted from the group and exited quickly from the warehouse, returning after\r\na few seconds bearing a reddish tuft of hair in his gloved hand. “Now, Mister\r\nBrown, here’s your sample,” he said, and gave Father the tuft.\r\nFather rubbed it between his fingers and dropped it at once to the floor.\r\n“Gentlemen,” he pronounced, “if you have any machinery that will spin the hairs\r\nof a dog, one of those large, wire-haired red dogs, I believe, then I would advise\r\nyou to put this into it,” and with a flourish, he pulled off the blindfold.\r\nAfter that, the Englishmen seemed more respectful of Father and more openly\r\ncurious about our wool. We might be a couple of rustics from the republic of\r\nPumpkinshire, but we were not fools.\r\nNor were they. After some pleasantries—during which the rotund man in the\r\nyellow waistcoat took a drink from a silver flask and extended it to Father, who\r\nnaturally declined, suffering himself to be called, quite good-naturedly, a bloody\r\nparson—Father began once again to praise the quality of Brown & Perkins wool.\r\nIn the midst of his discourse, one of the more sober-visaged buyers, a man who\r\nup to now had been silent, interrupted him and said, “Mister Brown, I saw your\r\nson there setting out these bales.",
    " He’s a stout lumper, I must say, especially with\r\nhis dumb arm and all, my compliments, but really, sir, since it was so easy for\r\nhim to heft these bales, perhaps you could have him replace them and pull from\r\nyour stock a few that we ourselves might choose for appraisal. I’m sure you\r\nunderstand, sir.” This man was tall and distinguished-looking, with a narrow\r\ngray beard. He was somewhat older than the others, and they seemed to defer to\r\nhim—even Mr. Pickersgill, I noticed, whose interests were supposed to be the\r\nseller’s, not the buyer’s—for they all punctuated his statement with wise nods\r\nand pursed lips, as if for his approval.\r\nFather wasn’t pleased by the implications of the request, but he agreed to it,\r\nand I was obliged to haul the bales back, replacing them on the floor with three\r\nthat the tall Englishman himself selected, all of them, like the first batch, marked\r\nnumber 2, the base-price grade.\r\n“And now, my good man, if you would be so kind as to show us your fine\r\nAmerican wool,” said the Englishman, pointing with his cane at the center bale.\r\n“My pleasure,” Father said in a hard voice, and he cut the cord so as to expose\r\na top corner of the bale.\r\n“If you don’t mind,” said the Englishman, passing his cane to the man behind\r\nhim, and he took the knife from Father’s hand and swiftly cut away the rest of\r\nthe cord, stripping the bale halfway down of its burlap wrapper. The snowy\r\nwhite fleeces, released to the open air, puffed up at once and grew to nearly\r\ntwice their size, smelling sweetly of lanolin and freshly scythed grass, evoking a\r\nsudden, painful, unexpected memory of home, my first longing to return.\r\nIn silence then and in a strange sort of frenzy, five or six of the group rushed at\r\nthe open bale and plunged their hands into it.",
    " They groped up to their elbows\r\nand pulled fleeces apart and grabbed great clumps of wool from the depths of\r\nthe bale, sniffing it, rubbing tufts across their palms and between their fingers,\r\npassing snowy gouts back to their colleagues and reaching in for more. They\r\nwere like a pack of ravening wolves. We had never seen this sort of behavior\r\nfrom buyers before and were stunned into silence.\r\nFinally, Father recovered from his shock and called out, “Wait! Gentlemen,\r\nwait! You’re ruining the bale! What on earth are you doing?”\r\nThey went on a few moments longer, until at last the tall man stopped and\r\nturned to Father and glared at him. “This, sir, is what you Americans call clean\r\nwool?” he said in a cold voice, and he reached back into the bale with both\r\nhands and drew from its depths a large quantity of wool, nearly a bushel of it,\r\nand dropped it at Father’s feet. He retrieved his cane from one of his fellows and\r\nspread the wool out. It was filthy. Sticks, twigs, grass, and leaves and clots of\r\ndried fecal matter stuck to it.\r\nFather’s face reddened at once, as he realized what had happened. Bad luck,\r\nyes; but worse. Much worse.\r\n“More dirty Yankee wool, eh?” one of the fellows in back called. “Same old\r\nstuff”\r\n“Filthy.”\r\n“Disgusting.”\r\n“So there’s your Yankee parson, eh?”\r\nSeveral men in the group broke away then and moved towards the English\r\nsheepmen further down. Mr. Pickersgill hesitated a moment, but quickly\r\nfollowed after them, as if eager not to be associated with us. The tall Englishman\r\ndid not leave, however, and now he stared hard at Father, whose ears and neck\r\nwere scarlet with embarrassment and anger. “Mister Brown” he said evenly, “I’m\r\nquite disappointed. Frankly, I took you to be an honest man.”\r\n“I am! I... this is a mistake, sir,” he stammered. “A mistake. It’s but a single\r\nbale. I... I myself have been cheated by this bale, sir.",
    "”\r\n“Indeed.”\r\n“No, really, sir. Why not examine another bale? Here, here, take a poke\r\nthrough this one,” he said, indicating the next bale. “Owen, bring down some\r\nothers for the gentleman toexamine,”he said.\r\n“Never mind that. I think we’ve seen enough” said the Englishman. “Mister\r\nBrown, you’d have to open every bale and sort out all two hundred thousand\r\npounds of your wool and separate the clean wool from the dirty and somehow\r\nwash and dry the rest, if you wished to sell it at the going rate now. You’d have\r\nto clean it the way it should’ve been cleaned in the beginning, and then repack\r\nit. All one hundred tons, Mister Brown. I rather doubt that you and your son\r\nhave the time and money to manage that. And even then, Mister Brown, why\r\nshould we trust you? Even then, no matter what you yourself claimed, we’d be\r\nbuying the wool on faith, and there’s a price for that, you know. It’s not the\r\ngoing price, I’m afraid.”\r\nFather responded with silence and stared at the savaged bale with loathing.\r\n“I’m sorry, Mister Brown. You seem like a decent fellow. I advise you to simply\r\nsell your wool here in Liverpool as it is. Get what you can for it, and return\r\nhome happy to have sold it at all. There’s enough of a shortage here this fall that\r\nyou’ll move it. It won’t go untaken.”\r\nFather looked at him coldly. “You’ve got me in a vise, haven’t you? You’ll pay\r\nwhat you want for my wool, glut the market, and drive down the price of your\r\nhomegrown stuff. Then you’ll turn around and probably sell our wool back to\r\nthe American clothmen, who’ll pay dearly for it, due to shortages there.” He was\r\nspluttering now, enraged, as his situation gradually became clear to him. The\r\nEnglish buyers were about to make themselves a pretty profit twice over and in\r\nthe bargain cheat the sheepmen on both sides of the Atlantic.",
    " They were\r\nprobably arranging this very minute to provide short-term, high-interest loans to\r\ntheir New England colleagues for the purchase of Brown & Perkins wool in\r\nLiverpool at a lower price than it would go for at home.\r\n“No one, except possibly you, is trying to cheat anyone, Mister Brown.”\r\n“I? I? I’ve been cheated more than anyone here!” Father shouted. “I can accept\r\nmy personal share in this disgrace, sir, but I didn’t know of it. I have been hurt\r\nhere! Hurt worse than you can ever know. My partner, Mister Simon Perkins, has\r\nbeen damaged financially by this fiasco, as have I. But my honor has been\r\ndamaged in this! My honor!”\r\n“Yes. Well, I’m sorry for that, Mister Brown. Good day, sir,” said the\r\nEnglishman, and he walked away, leaving Father and me staring down at the\r\nwrecked bale of wool, its contents scattered over the floor at our feet. It was an\r\nugly mess; it was also an indictment, and a trap. Father knew that he had been\r\ndisgraced. And that it could only lead to further disgrace.\r\n“Oh, Owen. What will I do? What will I do now?” His hard gray eyes suddenly\r\nsoftened and went wet, and his face fell and appeared to collapse into itself. I\r\nthought for a moment that he might sit down upon the floor and weep, and I\r\nreached forward and put my arm around his shoulders.\r\n“Be the good shepherd, Father.”\r\n“Please, son. Don’t talk nonsense.”\r\n“I mean it, be the good shepherd. Cease being the man who is the hireling and\r\nnot the shepherd. Leave off being the man who doesn’t own the sheep, and when\r\nhe sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, so the sheep are scattered and\r\nslain.”\r\n“Yes. It’s in the Book of John. Yes, I know.”\r\n“Be the good shepherd,” I said again, for I wished him to understand that all\r\nthese men were hirelings and wolves, and in this wool business we were but\r\nhirelings ourselves.",
    " And now, at the coming of the wolves, we appeared to have\r\nabandoned the sheep, who were our enslaved Negro brethren at home. “Be the\r\ngood shepherd, the Bible says, and know thy sheep and be known of thine.”\r\n“Do I understand you, Owen?”\r\n“I hope so. Yes.”\r\n“You’re calling me back to myself. Aren’t you, son?”\r\nI told him that I was, and that we did not need to dwell so much either on\r\nvictory or on defeat here amongst the hirelings and the wolves, so long as the\r\noutcome of our business with them was to depart from them at once and bring\r\nus back to our true selves. We should do here whatever we could and do it with\r\nequanimity and calm straightforwardness, I said, but then we should return at\r\nonce to our true work, where our worth wasn’t measured by our ability to obtain\r\na few cents per pound of wool one way or the other. If we were doing our true\r\nwork, our worth would be measured in links of broken chain, in manacles cast\r\noff, and in whips plucked from the hands of slavemasters and thrown upon the\r\nground.\r\nI was ashamed, I told him, to be as distracted as I had been lately by this\r\nbusiness of selling wool, this business of being a hireling. I wanted to return to\r\nthe real battle, to the only thing that mattered. I wanted to resume our war\r\nagainst the slavers and to wage war against them until they were dead, every\r\nsingle one of them, or until every Negro man and woman in America was as free\r\nas I was myself and our nation had become a holy sanctuary and was no longer a\r\nprison and a charnel house.\r\nHe smiled sweetly up into my face and embraced me. In a low, tremulous\r\nvoice, he said, “You are fast becoming my greatest blessing, son. The Lord’s\r\ngreatest gift to me.”\r\nHis old force quickly returned to him then, and he bade me pack up the strewn\r\nwool from around the floor and tie the bale back as before, while he went to Mr.",
    "\r\nPickersgill and re-stated his desire to have our wool auctioned this afternoon as\r\npreviously scheduled. “But I’ll tell him not to accept less than twenty-seven cents\r\nper pound for number 2, thirty-five for number I, and so on up the line.” That\r\nwould undercut the English prices enough to get it sold, he said, but not by so\r\nmuch that we’d be left with nothing to show for our troubles. It was less than\r\nwhat we would have got in Springfield last month, but it was the best we could\r\ndo today here in England. “We’ll just do what we can, and we’ll move straight on\r\nfrom there. Right, son?”\r\n“Right. Action, Father! Action, action, action!”\r\n“Ah, that’s the boy!” he said, his eyes gleaming with pleasure. “Owen, the Lord\r\nhath given thee an understanding heart. He hath given thee wisdom! Thou art\r\nmy Solomon. I should have named thee Solomon!” he declared. “Should I do\r\nthat, call thee Solomon?”\r\n“No,” I said, laughing. “Not unless you call yourself David.”\r\nHis eyes widened comically, although he didn’t intend to be funny, and he\r\nshook his head, as if to rid himself of the notion of being named David. Then off\r\nhe hurried, to speak with Mr. Pickersgill, while I bent to the task of repairing the\r\nbroken bale of dirty wool.\r\nChapter 13\r\nOur return from England to Springfield that autumn, hapless and empty-handed,\r\nthe failed Yankee woolen entrepreneurs, was unremarkable—except for Father’s\r\nrenewed ferocity regarding the war against the slaveholders. We had, of course,\r\nheard the news, just before departing Liverpool, of the passage of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Act: it was in all the English newspapers.",
    " There were reports of disruptions\r\nand public demonstrations in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia and\r\nwidespread outrage, even among Northern whites who previously had been\r\nacquiescent, and calls for armed resistance for the first time from the\r\nGarrisonians (although Father did not count that for much). As a result of this\r\ncowardly piece of legislation, there was now no safe haven for escaped slaves\r\nanywhere in America. A Negro human being was like a wandering cow,\r\nidentified by color and all too often by the owner’s brand, returnable when and\r\nwherever found. And free Negroes, too, were terrified for their lives, for the new\r\nlaw turned every white citizen of every Northern state into an unpaid agent of\r\nSouthern slaveowners and gave no legal protection to free Negro men, women,\r\nor children, any one of whom could be instantly transformed into an escaped\r\nslave merely by a bounty-hunter’s say-so and hauled off to the South and sold as\r\nchattel.\r\nMostly, it was this Fugitive Slave Act that provided the Old Man with a new\r\nfocus for his rage, which, since the debacle in Timbuctoo, had been somewhat\r\ndeflected by the now-failed mission to England for Brown & Perkins and by our\r\nFlemish holiday, as I thought of it. Also, quietly, I had begun to encourage his\r\nrage, for I was now eager to test my own mettle in the fires of battle. This was a\r\nnew role for me, heating up Father’s blood, and it was strangely exhilarating to\r\nme. Who would have thought it: Owen Brown, the quiet son, encouraging the\r\nOld Man to march steadily against the enemy?\r\nDespite our love and respect for him, I don’t think we took his plan all that\r\nseriously, even when he rolled out his maps and described his strategies to\r\npeople outside the family fold, as he had done with our friend Lyman Epps and\r\npoor Mr. Fleete, shot in the escape from Elizabethtown.",
    " Father had revealed his\r\nsecret plan to a few white people, too, such as Mr. Thompson, our friend and\r\nneighbor in North Elba, before they broke over the matter of transporting the\r\nNegro couple from Richmond, and Mr. Gerrit Smith, back when he first made\r\nthe arrangement to settle us in Timbuctoo. Whenever he did reveal his plan, the\r\nOld Man always swore his listener to absolute secrecy, naturally, but who would\r\nnot eagerly guarantee silence? The plan seemed so crack-brained then that no\r\none would have believed you if you told him what Old Brown was up to. We in\r\nthe family certainly told no one, if for no other reason than that we were\r\nsomewhat embarrassed by it. We wished to protect Father’s reputation for\r\nprobity, after all, and also our own. And who wants to be laughed at, especially\r\non someone else’s account?\r\nGenerally, then, until the autumn that Father and I returned from England, I\r\nhad treated his plan for invading the South and liberating the slaves as another\r\nof his harmless diversions, an elaborate way for him to express the anger and\r\nfrustration caused by his financial failures and by the pacifism and compromises\r\nof the other whites in the anti-slave movement and by the fearfulness and lack of\r\nunity among so many Negroes. It kept him from despair over his money-\r\nproblems, and it stopped him from throwing up his hands in disgust and walking\r\nout on the abolitionists altogether. It was his fantasy, not mine.\r\nThere was one early occasion, however, when I actually, whole-heartedly,\r\nshared his dream of a war of liberation and terror. It occurred when he first\r\nrevealed his plan to Frederick Douglass. I watched this distinguished, intelligent,\r\nworldly gentleman, a Southerner and an escaped slave himself, a man who knew\r\nthe risks and stakes personally, a true warrior in the war against slavery—I\r\nwatched Mr.",
    " Douglass take Father’s military strategies seriously and felt\r\nashamed of my skepticism and temporarily cast it off. Although it would be\r\nanother two years before I rid myself of it for good, that night in ‘48 in\r\nSpringfield, when Mr. Douglass first came to visit, was an important beginning\r\nof my life as a warrior, too.\r\nI remember hurrying home on a dark, wintry night from the Brown & Perkins\r\nwarehouse to our crowded little house on Franklin Street, hoping to be there in\r\ntime for supper with the others. Walking slam-bang through the door into the\r\nfront parlor, I saw Father seated at the table with a tall, broad-shouldered, dark\r\nbrown man with a forceful jaw and a great leonine mass of hair. I recognized\r\nMr. Douglass instantly, of course, for although I had not seen him in the flesh\r\nbefore this, engravings of his handsome, impressive face had appeared in any\r\nnumber of issues of The Liberator and other abolitionist periodicals. He was\r\nyounger than I had thought him to be, still in his early thirties then, but with\r\nbeginning streaks of gray in his hair. He had a massive face and a broad, high\r\nforehead, a wonderfully patrician look, but in an African way, as if he were a\r\ndirect descendant of a long line of Ethiopian kings. Seated side by side at the old\r\npine table where we normally took our meals, both men were gazing intently at\r\na large sheet of paper Father’s map of Virginia and points south, I saw at once.\r\nHis Subterranean Passway.\r\nBack then, when we were newly located in Springfield and Brown & Perkins\r\nwas briefly thought to be a thriving business, visitors to our home were often\r\nvisibly surprised to see how modestly we lived. Mr.",
    " Douglass, in his fine woolen\r\nsuit, sat stiffly at the table, his feet squarely under his chair, as if he were more\r\naccustomed to meeting white abolitionists in formal, velvet-covered parlors than\r\nin a workingman’s dwelling-place. We owned very little furniture then, a\r\ncontinuing effect of the Ohio bankruptcy, which was actually of a benefit to us\r\nin that narrow, wood-frame row house—the rooms were tiny, like hutches, and\r\nwe were a family of nine people and needed the space for our very bodies. We\r\nutilized the six small chambers in an unorthodox way, determined more by need\r\nthan by convention, making the kitchen serve as a combination cookroom,\r\nwashroom, and workshop and the front parlor as an office and for taking our\r\nmeals. Father and Mary slept in the dining room proper, and we children, seven\r\nof us, were distributed by sex and age in the three sleeping rooms upstairs. It\r\nwas a spartan home in a laborers’ neighborhood but, withal, a cozy and cheerful\r\nplace, where we had many guests and visitors, mostly unpretentious people,\r\nsheepmen from out west and Negroes connecting through Father to a line or\r\nway-station of the Underground Railroad, people who made themselves\r\ncomfortable in such bare surroundings more easily, perhaps, than Mr. Douglass.\r\nFather introduced me to the man. “This is my third son, Owen. He’s been\r\nworking late at the warehouse,”he said, to explain the tufts of wool clinging to\r\nmy clothing and hair and the dirt on my face and hands.\r\nMr. Douglass rose from his seat and extended his large hand and smiled gently.\r\n“A pleasure” he said, a simple statement made almost lordly by his powerful,\r\ndeep voice and regal bearing. This was a man! I rubbed my hand on my\r\ncoveralls and grasped his and shook it with enthusiasm, although I was too shy\r\nand awed by him to speak a single word.",
    "\r\n“Mister Douglass is on his way to Rochester, from a speaking engagement in\r\nBoston. He learned of us from the Reverends Garnet and Loguen,” Father said,\r\nobviously pleased by having been recommended by the two Negro radicals.\r\n“They said we were to be trusted. No small encomium for a white man, if I may\r\nsay so, coming from those two,”he said to Mr. Douglass with evident pride.\r\nMr. Douglass smiled generously at Father. “Yes, that’s true, I’m afraid.”\r\n“When you’ve washed and changed your shin, Owen, you may come and join\r\nus,” Father then said.\r\nI rushed through my ablutions back in the kitchen, where Mary and Ruth and\r\nthe younger children were at work preparing supper. John was then still in\r\nAkron, finishing his business school studies, and Jason and Fred were situated in\r\nHudson, minding Mr. Simon Perkins’s flocks. Although I was the eldest son then\r\nin residence, I was still young enough to be surprised and honored by Father’s\r\ninvitation to join him and Mr. Douglass in the parlor.\r\nWhen I arrived back at the table and took my seat next to Father, I saw that he\r\nwas showing Mr. Douglass his sketches of the log blockhouses that he intended\r\nto build at strategic points along the Passway, forts to serve both as supply\r\ndepots for his army and as way-stations for passing the liberated slaves north—\r\nthose who chose not to stay in the South and fight alongside him and his main\r\nforce. Father had long ago designed these simple structures: easily defended,\r\nwindowless cubes made of thick logs with firing slots and secret basements and\r\nlong escape tunnels, they were to be tucked away in the narrow defiles and\r\ngorges of the Appalachians. He believed, against all conventional thinking on the\r\nmatter, that a military force could better defend a low place than a high.",
    " In\r\nDeuteronomy, the Lord had warned the Israelites against settling in high places\r\n—and for good reason, according to Father. “First, because in a low place you’ll\r\nhave a well, and your water won’t run out. And second, because if the defile is\r\nsufficiently narrow, you can’t be surrounded. In order to lay a siege against you,\r\nthe enemy will be obliged to divide his force and climb to the heights. At which\r\npoint, you proceed at once to charge against the weakened force left below, and\r\nthen you quickly surround the climbers on high, who will now be under siege by\r\nyou, trapped without water and with no way down except by your leave.”\r\n“I see,” said Mr. Douglass. “And you propose to man each of these blockhouses\r\nwith a small force of... what? Twenty-five men at the most?”\r\n“At most,” Father said.\r\n“Whilst your main army conducts forays into the flatlands below.”\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n“Fine, but how shall they be supplied? Your main forces can’t do it. They’ll be\r\ntoo busy eluding capture and hanging by the slaveowners.”\r\n“They’ll be supplied from the North,” Father explained. He would establish\r\nagents in Ohio and Pennsylvania, whose responsibility would be to gather and\r\nstore supplies and arms purchased for them by radical abolitionist supporters\r\nand to ship them south along the Passway, even as freshly liberated slaves came\r\nnorth along the same route. No wagon would come south empty, just as no\r\nwagon would return empty, either: the Underground Railroad was to run two\r\nways now, instead of one. Father’s main army, he went on, would simply take its\r\nsupplies, its food, fresh horses, and so forth, from the raided plantations. They\r\nwould also have whatever food and supplies they were given by sympathetic\r\nSouthern whites.",
    " For there would be some supporters among the whites, Father\r\nwas sure, small farmers and the like, who, not owning any slaves, were bound to\r\nbe profoundly disgusted by the ways that the system oppressed them, too, people\r\nwho would therefore welcome the opportunity to aid and abet men come south\r\nto wage war against slavery.\r\nHere Mr. Douglass shook his great head. “I think, Mister Brown, that you don’t\r\nknow those folks like I do. You’re a white man and perhaps understand whites,\r\nbut you’re not a Southern white man. Go on, though. There’s much to admire\r\nhere anyhow,” he said gently.\r\nA sustained, guerilla war would swiftly drive the price of a slave worth one\r\nthousand dollars today to ten thousand dollars or even more, Father explained.\r\nThe cotton could not be grown, harvested, ginned, shipped, and sold without a\r\nhuge labor force, and there were not enough whites in the South to accomplish\r\nthat great and economically necessary task alone. Father was convinced that if\r\nthe fight lasted long enough and caused a sufficient number of slaves to escape,\r\nthe costs of holding on to their slaves would so greatly outweigh the benefits\r\nthat the Slavocracy would move to strike a deal that would free all slaves in\r\nexchange for their return home as paid workers. “Slaves run north for freedom”\r\nFather noted, “not work.” If they had freedom, they would stay, and many of\r\nthose now living in the North would likely return also. “I do not intend to\r\nconquer the South,” Father declared. “I merely mean to make slavery\r\nprohibitively expensive. If a people cannot be made to do the right thing, Mister\r\nDouglass, then we must make them do the thing that is in their interest.”\r\nFor this reason, he was convinced that his war of liberation must be\r\nundertaken now or very soon, before slavery was extended into the western\r\nterritories.",
    " If we did not strike now, he said, when the Southern states, because\r\nof their dependence on cotton, were economically vulnerable and more or less\r\nevenly matched in Congress by the North, then we would be faced later with\r\nonly two alternatives—division of the Union or a bloody civil war. Or perhaps\r\nboth. The longer we delayed, the more successful the South would be in\r\nextending slavery into Texas and the other territories, and even into Cuba and\r\nMexico. Expansion out of the South into the west and the Caribbean isles would\r\ndiversify the slaveholding economy from cotton and soon make it powerful\r\nbeyond belief, and as those territories became states, they would come to\r\ndominate the North in Congress. With a slaveowning Democrat President,\r\nSenate, and House of Representatives, the North would have no choice but to\r\nsecede from the Union or, to avoid total absorption by the Slavocracy, go to war.\r\nThere were already calls for secession-or-war from both sides.\r\n“Yes, but let me be sure, Mister Brown, that you’re not resurrecting that old\r\nidea of a black republic. Your plan could produce that. I would vehemently\r\noppose that. A little land-locked Haiti, separate from and surrounded by a white\r\nUnited States;’ Mr. Douglass said. “I would not wish for that.”\r\n“No, no, no! Not at all. Well, temporarily, perhaps. But only as a way of\r\nkeeping the venture from being mistakenly construed as a policy of the Northern\r\nstates,” Father insisted. He wished to do it more or less the same as the Texans\r\nhad done against Mexico. He planned to publish assurances that as soon as\r\nslavery was abolished in every state and territory, his temporary Negro republic\r\nwould be dissolved, at which time all conquered regions would be returned to\r\nthe control of their original state governments.\r\nMr. Douglass sighed heavily, a melancholy exhalation, and peered down at the\r\nmap before him.",
    " “The federal army will come after you, sir. It doesn’t matter,\r\nNorth or South—they won’t permit it.”\r\nIt would take them too long to act, Father explained, and when they did, he\r\nwould have moved his forces to another front. From the mountains of Virginia,\r\nwe would slip down to the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee and on\r\ninto the hills of Georgia. We would be divided into small, highly mobile units,\r\nlittle more than bands, striking where least expected and then retreating to our\r\nmountain hideouts, disappearing into the upland forests like the Seminole\r\nIndians into the swamps of Florida. Also, as he pointed out, our campaign would\r\nhave hundreds of thousands of civilian supporters, millions, North and South,\r\nwhich would weaken to a crucial degree any federal army commissioned to stop\r\nus. “A federal army would have to cut down every tree from Alabama to Ohio to\r\ndefeat us!” Father said, wagging a finger.\r\n“They well might. Perhaps—” Mr. Douglass began.\r\nFather interrupted him. “Also, I believe that our job could be completed in a\r\nsingle year, too soon for them to muster the requisite force. On the first day,\r\nright off, we’d issue a statement of our intentions and show our willingness to\r\nnegotiate a peace strictly in terms of the ending of slavery. We’d be absolutely\r\nclear that we have no other intention but to end slavery. A war conducted\r\nwithout a precise goal can never be won! Remember that, Mister Douglass. I\r\nlearned it in Europe. By the same token, the more precise the goal, the fewer\r\nsoldiers needed to win it. Learned that there, too.",
    " You must state your objective\r\nclearly and then show that you’re willing to die for it, and if you can\r\ndemonstrate that it’s in your enemy’s own interest to have you gain your\r\nobjective, as we’ll do by making the market price of every slave in America\r\ninsupportably high, victory will fall into your lap like an overripe fruit!”\r\nWhile the two went back and forth, Father explaining and defending his ideas\r\nand Mr. Douglass questioning them, gently objecting here and there, but\r\ngradually, as it seemed to me, going along, I looked freshly at Father’s map of\r\nhis wonderful Subterranean Passway. It was the central nervous system for his\r\nwhole operation, a spinal cord that ran from Timbuctoo south all the way to\r\nAlabama, with a thousand nerve-like branches east and west along the way. I\r\nremembered, years before, first tying into it from a western branch, riding down\r\nfrom Ohio with Father and my brothers into the hills of Kentucky, where we met\r\nslaves who had escaped from plantations far to the south in Georgia and South\r\nCarolina, exhausted men, women, and children who had been passed along for\r\nweeks, emerging blinking into the light of freedom as if they had come up from\r\na network of tunnels hundreds of miles long. And I knew that Timbuctoo, where\r\nwe would soon be living, tapped into the Passway at its head in the Adirondacks,\r\nand lately we had come at it from the east here in Springfield, Massachusetts,\r\nwhere I had seen the great Harriet Tubman, she whom Father called The\r\nGeneral, “a woman who is most of a man,”he said, and heard her testify as to its\r\nexistence. It was real, this Subterranean Passway. Father had not dreamed it up.\r\nThe slaveholders had not been able to sever it or to block it permanently\r\nanywhere along its length. If they attacked it in one place, it appeared the next\r\nnight in another.",
    " Father’s plan for a guerilla war against the Slavocracy was, in\r\nfact, a logical extension of the ongoing work of the Underground Railroad, and\r\nhe had focused his thinking on the one aspect of the Railroad that no other\r\nabolitionist had so far grasped—that its continued existence had slowly raised\r\nthe dollar value of slaves. He was proposing simply to accelerate that process.\r\nMr. Douglass said to Father, “Well, I do admire your plan, Mister Brown. Or,\r\nrather, I should say that I admire portions of your plan. Naturally, you aren’t the\r\nfirst man, white or Negro, to propose leading an armed rebellion among the\r\nslaves. It’s a common enough dream. But, unlike most others, you’ve anticipated\r\nmany of the difficulties. And you have the large picture in mind as well. One\r\nthing, however. A question. I have many questions, sir, but this one first. I\r\nassume that you yourself plan to be the general for this army. And also the\r\npresident of this ‘temporary’ Negro republic in the mountains. Does this mean\r\nthat you, sir, would be our Moses?” Mr. Douglass smiled, but his words belied\r\nthe smile.\r\nFather looked at him straight. “I’ll tell you the truth. I’ll tell you the reason I’ve\r\nrevealed all this to you tonight, Mister Douglass. I would have you be the Moses\r\nof your people, sir. Not me, and not any other white man. No, Mister Douglass, I\r\nwould be Aaron unto thee, anointed and consecrated by thee, and then I would\r\ngo forth and make the blood sacrifice for both our peoples. The crime against\r\none is the sin of the other, and to avenge the crime is to expunge the sin.”\r\nThere was a long silence as the two looked directly into one another’s eyes—\r\ndark, melancholy eyes and flashing gray eyes. On the Negro man’s face was\r\nimprinted a great question, and on the white maris face a great statement, and\r\nthe two, wordlessly, were struggling to make them match.",
    " I don’t think that Mr.\r\nDouglass had ever heard a white man speak like this before, at least a white man\r\nwhom he did not think crazy. And I don’t believe that Father had ever spoken\r\nquite like this before.\r\nIn a low voice, Father said, “I have four grown sons who will follow me into\r\nthe South.”\r\nWho was the fourth? I thought, and then remembered our poor Fred. But, yes,\r\nwhy not Fred, too? In this matter, what was true of John, Jason, and me was\r\ntrue of him also. Yes, we will follow you, all four of us.\r\nFather then said, “I have raised every member of my family to take this war\r\nstraight to the slavemasters. They and I are prepared to die for it.”\r\nMr. Douglass slowly turned his great head to me. He looked me up and down\r\nand said, “Well, is this true, young man? That you’re prepared to die in battle?\r\nTo die for the benefit of Negro slaves? Are you ready to give up your young life\r\nso that another young man, whose skin is black, can live as a free man?”\r\nI glanced again at Father’s map of the Passway and saw that it was a good\r\nplan; it would work; he was right—victory would fall into our lap like overripe\r\nfruit. And I remember thinking then that I would not die; I could not: I was\r\nstrong and intelligent, I could run very fast, I was a fine shot and a first-rate\r\nhorseman and could live in the forest like an Indian: and so I said to Mr.\r\nDouglass, “Yes, sir, I’m prepared for that. Father has prepared me pretty well. He\r\nhas anointed and consecrated me and prepared me for the blood sacrifice, like\r\nMoses did for Aaron.”\r\nI saw Father suppress a look of simple pride and perhaps surprise at the\r\nboldness of my speech. He said, “So you see, Mister Douglass. I may well be\r\nMoses, but only here, in my own house.”\r\n“Yes,” he said. “I do see. And I confess, I’m mightily impressed by all this.",
    " My\r\nbrothers Garnet and Loguen, when they told me that you’re a very unusual white\r\nman, were not wrong.” He admitted, however, that all talk of slave rebellion\r\nmade him nervous, especially when it was generated by men who themselves,\r\nwhite or Negro, would remain safely at home in the North, while the poor slaves\r\nrose up and got cut to pieces. Very few men were willing to be a Nat Turner.\r\n“But no matter how it goes, win or lose, there’ll be death and gore enough for\r\nany man, believe me, Mister Brown. No matter how ingenious your plan or how\r\nbrave you and your sons are, there will be killing on both sides. And I’m not sure\r\nI want to be responsible for that. Not yet anyhow. These are mighty questions\r\nbefore us, sir.”\r\nMary and Ruth had set the table and were now carrying our supper out from\r\nthe kitchen in several steaming pots. Father cleared away his charts and papers,\r\nas the children came and joined us, and soon we were ten people gathered\r\naround the table. Father, as always, commenced to pray over the food. While he\r\nprayed, I stole a glance down the table at Mr. Douglass, who was watching the\r\nscene as if from a great height with an expression of sweet approval on his broad\r\nface.\r\nI looked over the scene myself then, to view it from his mild perspective—and\r\nsaw a deeply religious family of modest means, a family with great peace of\r\nmind, with total unity and strange clarity of purpose, the wife and the children,\r\nfrom the eldest to the infant, instructed and led in all things by the firm but\r\nkindly Puritan patriarch, this straight-backed, gray-eyed man with light in his\r\nface, praying over them all: and most amazing of all, they were a clan of white\r\npeople who saw the world, inexplicably, the way Negroes did.\r\nWe did not, of course. Not back then, we didn’t—except possibly for Father.",
    " As\r\na family, we had not yet undergone our trial by fire, our harrowing in Kansas\r\nand Virginia. And I dare not believe that even Father saw the world back then in\r\nSpringfield as Negroes did; it only seemed so, because of the vast difference\r\nbetween him and other white abolitionists in their personal treatment of\r\nNegroes, and because of the quality of his rage.\r\nBesides, I had lied to Mr. Douglass. I was not willing to die for the freedom of\r\nthe Negro, or for any other reason. But I did not know that then—I had thought\r\nthat I was telling the truth, when in fact I was merely incapable of imagining my\r\nown death. Though I was twenty-four years old, I was still a boy. It really wasn’t\r\nuntil nearly two years later, during my journey to England, that I came to a\r\npoint where I was truly willing to pay the price of being the man I wished to be\r\nand was willing, therefore, to die in the war against slavery. Once I’d reached\r\nthat point, I was myself free and was no longer a boy. I had become a warrior,\r\nand thenceforth began increasingly to be of good use to Father, whose force and\r\nclarity of purpose, as happens to all warriors, sometimes weakened or grew\r\nconfused.\r\nFather had been right about the British cloth manufacturers. They had purchased\r\nour wool at prices so low they could sell it at a considerable profit straight back\r\nto their American counterparts, those same sly fellows whose monopolistic bids\r\nfor Brown & Perkins wool had driven the Old Man into the English market in the\r\nfirst place. Thus, by shipping his and Mr. Perkins’s one hundred tons of wool off\r\nto England and selling it at discount there, Father had succeeded only in\r\nincreasing the company’s indebtedness to its western suppliers. He had nearly\r\ndoubled it, in fact. And the sheepmen were furious. From their perspective, their\r\nwool, a full year’s work, had been practically given away.",
    "\r\nFor a few days, before leaving England, the Old Man had tried blaming the\r\nsheepmen themselves, for trapping him with a few unlucky bales of dirty wool,\r\nbut that would not hold up. He’d trapped himself, and knew it. In his rush to\r\nmove all his stock to England, he had abandoned his usual rigor in checking the\r\nwool, and he’d graded it carelessly as well—a surprising amount of XXX and XX\r\nturned out to be number 1 and number 2. Thus, by the time we were aboard\r\nship and headed home, he had ceased to blame anyone but himself, and for most\r\nof the crossing back, the Old Man beat his breast and spoke with thees and\r\nthous.\r\nThe truth was, again, that he had failed miserably, and there was no hiding it,\r\nnot even from himself. The absurdity of his situation, the ridiculously tangled\r\nnature of his finances, had reached a point where he could no longer imagine\r\never getting free of it and would be forced to work now mainly to keep himself\r\nout of prison, for he knew that he was about to be deluged by a flood of\r\nlawsuits, large and small. Many of the sheepmen were convinced, unfairly but\r\nunderstandably, that Father had taken a bribe to ship their wool to England and\r\nsell it at such a devastating loss. They could not believe that a sane man would\r\nhave done such a thing otherwise, and they were already serving notice to John\r\nin Springfield that they thought so. Fortunately, Mr. Perkins was still willing to\r\nstand by the Old Man, which would enable him to keep the family intact and\r\nsheltered in North Elba: if we had land, we could always feed and clothe\r\nourselves. Father himself, however, would soon be racing from courthouse to\r\ncourthouse, back and forth from New England out to the old Western Reserve,\r\ndefending himself and Mr. Perkins against the myriad charges of fraud and\r\ndeceit that were being raised by their creditors.",
    "\r\nKnowing that this would become his main activity for a while had the\r\nunexpected benefit of taking Father’s mind for the first time in decades\r\ncompletely off moneymaking. It would allow him, when he was not preparing\r\nhis attorneys to defend him and Mr. Perkins in court, to concentrate on his anti-\r\nslave activities. The catastrophic losses in England were such that, at last, he\r\nwould be able to forget about becoming a rich man. Released from that\r\npossibility, he went through a sort of sea-change and began to be instead the\r\nman who entered history.\r\nAnd, of course, things had changed at home, too. The passage of the heinous\r\nFugitive Slave Act at once lit up the Northern sky like sheets of lightning and\r\nelectrified thousands of white men and women who up to now had regarded\r\nthemselves as moderate abolitionists. And suddenly our anger, our consuming\r\nrage, did not seem so odd anymore. Which was strange to me, for I had grown\r\nused to our family’s being both charged by its anger, as if it were our\r\nresponsibility, and isolated by it, as if it were our curse. Now that rage was the\r\nnorm, however, ours seemed to have been oddly premature and, in this new\r\ncontext, somehow inappropriate and useless. At least to me it did.\r\nFather simply declared that it proved we had been right all along. But we had\r\nspent so much time and energy for so many years, all the years of my life,\r\njustifying in moral, legal, and Biblical terms the ferocity of our position, that we\r\nhad not stepped away from it and considered its deeper and more personal\r\nsources. We had not even considered whether it had such sources. What was\r\nabnormal to others had long seemed normal to us—until, thanks to the Fugitive\r\nLaw, everyone else turned out as alarmed and angry as we and as determined as\r\nwe to commit acts of violence in order to deter the further extension of slavery.",
    "\r\nEarlier, our alarm and anger and commitment had seemed evidence of our\r\nelection, as it were, proof of our moral superiority. Now, however, we were no\r\nlonger positioned amongst our people like prophets, for every decent person in\r\nthe North was finally awake to the emergency. Or so it briefly seemed. And\r\nduring this period, instead of feeling at one with my neighbors and grateful for\r\nthat, I began to wonder why had we seen so early the horrors of slavery, when\r\npractically everyone else was blind to it, and why we had been so ferocious,\r\nwhen nearly every other well-intended Northern white man and woman had\r\nmerely been concerned or, at best, disgusted.\r\nIt is difficult for me now, a whole lifetime beyond those years, to cross over all\r\nthe terrible intervening events and alterations in the sensibilities and values of\r\nordinary folks and remember how we thought then. The Civil War changed\r\neverything for everybody, white and Negro, North and South, East and West; but\r\nit was the war before the War, in Kansas and then at Harpers Ferry, that changed\r\nus Browns. That’s when we went from being angry activists and prophets in the\r\nwilderness to being cold-blooded warriors. We went from helping Negroes\r\nescape from slavery to killing those who would enslave them. Those were the\r\nyears when John Brown and his sons—farmers, shepherds, tanners, hopeful\r\nbusinessmen—became famous killers.\r\nWho else in our time went through this transition? No one, until later, when\r\nforced to by the War. By then, John Brown and his sons, most of them anyhow,\r\nwere dead—slain in battle or executed on the scaffold. It was as if, when our\r\nwhite neighbors finally woke to the threat of slavery and grew angry, as angry as\r\nwe had been all along, we moved at once to the next stage and in that way kept\r\nour old position towards them intact.",
    " It was as if our true nature, Father’s\r\nnature, certainly, and mine, and to a lesser degree the nature of our family as a\r\nwhole, arose from our insistence on maintaining a constant distance from others,\r\non holding to our radical extremity. We would not allow ourselves to be like\r\nother white people. We would be angrier than they; we would risk and sacrifice\r\nmore than they; we would be bloodier, more brutal, more consistently merciless\r\nand desperate than they.\r\nWe were becoming like Negroes, or wanted to become like them. Or, to be\r\nhonest and exact, we were becoming the kind of men and women that we\r\nwanted Negroes themselves to be.\r\nCan that have been true? For many years, I had sometimes thought that\r\nFather’s obsession with the enslavement of the Negroes was an unnatural thing.\r\nNo other white man or woman in my acquaintance was so singularly enraged by\r\nthe fate of black people, not even the most radical abolitionists, not even Gerrit\r\nSmith, who had given so much of his huge personal fortune to the cause. There\r\nwere heroes in the movement, of course, men and women like Theodore Weld\r\nand the Grimké sisters, even a few who had given their lives for it, like Lovejoy.\r\nAnd there were many unknown people, men and women in small towns,\r\nclergymen, teachers, even businessmen, who had risked fortune, reputation, and\r\nphysical well-being in order to advance the war against slavery. And everywhere\r\nthere were poor, humble, God-fearing white folks, ordinary men and women\r\nwho daily made sacrifices and endangered themselves for the benefit of the\r\nNegro slaves.\r\nBut none of these, at least none that I ever met or even heard about, engaged\r\nthe Negro on such a personal level as did Father. It was as if he secretly believed\r\nthat at bottom he himself was a Negro.",
    " He seemed to believe that his white skin\r\n—and the skins of his children, too, and of his wife, and the skin of anyone who\r\nwould cleave to him in his enterprise—was black underneath. As if his rust-\r\ncolored hair, if he did not dye and forcibly straighten it, were black and crinkled.\r\nAs if his old-fashioned, pointy, New England Yankee face, that long, narrow\r\nhooked nose, grim slash of a mouth, and large red ears, were a mask hiding an\r\nAfrican nose, mouth, and ears.\r\nIn a racialist society like ours, such a belief might be seen as merely absurd or\r\nas self-contemptuous, especially by white people, and in any society, racialist or\r\nnot, it might be viewed as morally reprehensible. He could be accused, after all,\r\nof appropriating another man’s rewards for having endured great pain without\r\nhaving first been obliged to experience that pain himself. I have thought about\r\nthis matter for most of my life, for I came to be very like my father in it, and I\r\nmay well be dead wrong about it, but Father’s love for Negroes was not a simple\r\nextension of his love of justice, of his belief in the essential equality of all\r\nmankind, or of his abhorrence of cruelty, which was the case for most\r\nabolitionists and which should have been sufficient unto the cause. And mostly\r\nwas. For most white abolitionists it was sufficient, certainly, and for most\r\nNegroes. Negroes, after all, did not need white people to love them. They merely\r\nneeded us to deal justly with them, to grant them legal rights equal to our own,\r\nand not to be cruel to them merely because their skins were darker than ours.\r\nThey only wanted us to treat them as well as we treated each other. As they saw\r\nit, the word “colored” described all human beings. To Negroes, white was as\r\nmuch a color as black, red, or yellow—if not more so.",
    "\r\nIf the country had been made of one race of people, if everyone had been\r\nwhite, then Father would not have singled out white people for his love,\r\nobviously. But he would not have looked eastward across the Atlantic and loved\r\nAfrican Negroes, either; or black-skinned people anywhere. No, he loved\r\nAmerican blacks, and he loved them, I believe, because of their relation to the\r\ndominant race of American whites. He saw our nation as divided unfairly\r\nbetween light-colored people and dark, and he chose early and passionately to\r\nside with the dark. Something deep within his soul, regardless of his own skin\r\ncolor, something at the very bottom of his own sense of who he was, of who he\r\nwas especially in relation to the dominant, lighter race, went out to the souls of\r\nAmerican Negroes, so that he was able to ally himself with them in their struggle\r\nagainst slavery and American racialism, not merely because he believed they\r\nwere in the right, but because he believed that somehow he himself was one of\r\nthem.\r\nOf course, he was not one of them. He was a white man, with all the\r\ninescapable powers, privileges, and prerogatives of his race and sex: he could\r\nvote, own property, move about the land and settle wherever he chose; he could\r\nbelong to any institution or church or attend any school he could afford; he\r\ncould borrow money and loan it; he could invest his money in land or livestock\r\nand grow rich or become a bankrupt; he could own firearms; he could go to\r\nsleep at night and not fear that he would be wakened by slave-catchers and\r\nbounty-hunters come to sell him down the river; he knew who his parents,\r\ngrandparents, and great-grandparents were and where they were buried; his\r\nchildren and wife would never be taken from him by another man; he was a\r\nwhite man, and he knew it.",
    "\r\nAnd yet are there not adult men and women, with all the powers, privileges,\r\nand prerogatives of adults, who secretly think of themselves as children? Is it not\r\nas if our large, hairy bodies are merely fortunate disguises, and some of us are\r\nchildren going about in the adult world like spies, our hearts breaking daily at\r\nthe sight of what our fellow children must suffer solely as a consequence of their\r\nnot being as cleverly disguised as we? In cautious silence, we observe the\r\ncruelties and indignities, the inequities and powerlessness they must endure,\r\nuntil at last their bodies, too, grow large and hairy like ours and they are able to\r\npass into the general population of adults, where, like most people, they either\r\nforget that they were ever children themselves or else they, too, become spies.\r\nWe dare not identify ourselves one to the other, for fear that we will lose the\r\npowers and privileges of adulthood, and so we remain silent, whilst other\r\npeople’s children are beaten instead of nurtured, whilst other people’s children\r\nare humiliated and bullied instead of taught, whilst other people’s children are\r\ntreated as property, as objects of little value, instead of as human beings no less\r\nvaluable in the eyes of the Lord than are we ourselves.\r\nI believe that it was like this for Father, and became like this for me as well:\r\nthat very early in his life, he came to feel towards white people generally as an\r\nunusually sensitive child feels towards brutal, unfeeling adults generally. He felt\r\npowerless, humiliated, and deprived, and felt it so strongly, so vividly, that he\r\ncould not put it away when the circumstances which had brought about those\r\nfeelings changed and no longer applied to him—that is to say, when he had\r\nbecome an adult himself and saw himself as white.",
    " Instead, he began dreaming\r\nhimself as a Negro man, if he was anything like me—and I believe that he was—\r\nbecause his dream of himself as a child was too much a nightmare to endure and\r\ntoo powerful an experience for him to forget. This did not mean that he saw\r\nNegroes as children, and certainly not as child-like, any more than he saw\r\nhimself as a child or child-like. He merely saw them, in their relation to white\r\npeople, as his natural allies.\r\nOnce, I tried to bring this to him. I had been telling him of a dream I myself\r\nhad had, in which I looked down at my arms and hands, and they were black.\r\nWhere were we? I remember, it was the winter of ’58, and we were in Kansas,\r\ncrossing down into Vernon County, Missouri, the time that we brought out\r\neleven slaves and made such a wondrous fuss, our first raid into a slave state,\r\nand Father and I drove the wagon. Jason and Watson were with us then, along\r\nwith Jeremiah Anderson, Albert Hazlett, and John Kagi, several of the men who\r\ncame out of the Kansas wars and made up the core of our little army later in\r\nVirginia.\r\nIn my dream, I was surprised to see that I was a black-skinned man, but the\r\ndiscovery had pleased me and even made me proud, although it made me realize\r\nthat from now on, when amongst white people, I would have to hide my true\r\nself.\r\nIt was at that time a strange dream to me, and I asked Father as we rode along\r\nif he ever had such a dream. He said yes, certainly, he had often dreamed\r\nhimself as a Negro man, and whenever he did, he took it to mean simply that the\r\nLord was reminding him not to allow himself to feel separate from His Negro\r\nchildren. He had the dream mostly when Negroes were giving him a lot of\r\ntrouble, he said. When they would not do what he wanted, or when he could not\r\ndo what they wanted.",
    "\r\nI asked him then, “When did you first know that Negroes were as human as\r\nyou yourself?”\r\nFather knew that I wasn’t merely inquiring into the origins of his principles,\r\nfor they had evolved naturally over years, as principles must. I was asking him\r\nabout the sources of his understanding. He answered that he had been little\r\nmore than a boy when, for the first time, he believed that Negro people were\r\nactually people, and he had never forgotten it. Many white people, including his\r\nown father, had taught it, of course, but Father had not until then truly\r\nunderstood it. Most white people don’t ever get that understanding, he said. Just\r\nas most men don’t believe, truly and deeply, that women are people. They think\r\nthat, because they’re different than we, they are another type of creature than\r\nwe, as a beloved horse or dog is.\r\n“I was twelve” he went on, “and my father sent me by myself with a herd of\r\nlivestock—cattle, mostly, but a few wild steers, too, and pigs, a sizeable,\r\ntroublesome herd—all the way to General Hull’s headquarters at Detroit. It was a\r\nhundred-mile trek, west from our place in Hudson in Ohio along the long shore\r\nof Lake Erie through hostile Indian territory, because of the War and the British\r\nagitations, to where the American forces were holding off the British in the\r\nwestern campaign. No easy task for a boy of twelve,” he said simply.\r\nGrandfather Brown was then supplying meat to the army, and Father had\r\naccompanied him on several previous journeys to the front, but this was the first\r\ntime that he had done it alone. He had told this much of the story before, but\r\nmainly as an example of his youthful independence.\r\n“Anyhow, I stayed up there for a spell with a very gentlemanly landlord, a\r\nman once a United States marshal, who held a slave boy very near my own age.",
    "\r\nThe boy was a very active, congenial lad, intelligent and full of good feeling, and\r\nto whom I was under considerable obligation for numerous little acts of\r\nkindness. The master made a great pet of me” he said. The man had brought\r\nFather to table with his first company and friends and called their attention to\r\nevery little smart thing he said or did and to the fact of his being more than a\r\nhundred miles from home alone with a herd of cattle.\r\n“All the while, this fine Negro boy, who was fully my equal, if not more, was\r\nbadly clothed, poorly fed and lodged in cold weather, and he was beaten before\r\nmy very eyes with an iron shovel or any other thing that came to the master’s\r\nhand. This terribly insulted my new-found pride in my accomplishments and my\r\ngeneral smartness. It was as if I myself were being insulted and beaten. I’m\r\nashamed to this day that I said nothing in protest,” he declared. It brought him,\r\nhowever, to reflect in a way that was new to him on the wretched, hopeless\r\ncondition of slave children. On their being without a father or mother to protect\r\nand provide for them. That lad was alone in the world, and it was hateful to\r\nFather, the way the boy was treated. “The boy was so alone, Owen, that later, in\r\nmy bed, I wept bitterly for him.” He said nothing for a few moments as we rode\r\nalong the rough trail, and I thought that he was fighting off tears now at the\r\nmemory of the Negro boy. After a while, he seemed to gather his emotions and\r\nsaid, “I was decidedly not a Christian at that age. But I remember wondering for\r\nthe first time if perhaps only God was that slave boy’s father.”\r\n“Who would have been his mother, then, if God was his father?” I asked.\r\n“Well, he would have no mother, I guess. No earthly mother, for certain, and\r\nno heavenly mother, either. God alone would have to be sufficient. As He is\r\nsufficient for us all.",
    " And had he not been one of God’s children, the boy would\r\nhave been a truly lost soul. That was a thing I could not imagine in a child.” He\r\npaused for a moment and added, “I understood that, I suppose, for I had lost my\r\nown mother by then.”\r\n“Like me.”\r\n“Yes. Like you.”\r\nOrdinarily, when such an exchange occurred between us, Father would have\r\ncorrected me, pointing out that I had a mother, after all, my stepmother, Mary.\r\nBut this time he must have been remembering with unusual vividness how it\r\nbeen for him when he, too, was only eight years old and had not yet found God\r\nwhen his mother died and left him with only his earthly father. When he had\r\nbeen a truly lost soul. So he did not correct me, and we rode on into Missouri in\r\na brooding silence.\r\nI had learned something important, though. For the first time, I had perceived,\r\nhowever dimly, that there existed a significant connection between the way\r\nFather felt towards the Negro and the terrible, desolating wound he had suffered\r\nin his heart when his mother died. Though no one knew of it, of course—\r\nprobably not even Father himself—it was not his principles but the lifelong\r\neffects of his childhood wound that had made the American Negroes his natural\r\nally and that, in their eyes, made him that rarest of things, a trustworthy\r\nAmerican white man. They trusted his rage, which he had come to direct\r\nentirely against slavery. And they trusted his permanent suspicions of white\r\npeople, especially when it came to the subject of race: he was always ready to be\r\nbetrayed by whites and even often thought Negroes too easily duped by them.\r\nAlso, Negroes trusted his inability to forget about race, his insistence on seeing it\r\nas a factor in every dealing, every relationship, every conflict, between any two\r\nAmericans, whether they were of the same race or not.",
    " Father took race to be\r\nthe central and inescapable fact of American life and character, and thus he did\r\nnot apologize for its being the central fact of his own life and character. And to\r\nthe degree that my nature resembled his, by virtue of my upbringing, of my own\r\ndesolating wound, which was so like Father’s, and of my having deliberately\r\nmodeled myself on him, race was the central factor of my life and character, too.\r\nAnd by the time we returned from our English journey to Springfield and took\r\nup the fight anew, I had become sufficiently accepting of my nature that I, too,\r\nno longer apologized for it.\r\nIt did not take long for Father to throw himself into a plan for creating in\r\nSpringfield an armed and trained militia among the Negroes there. And while it\r\nwas perhaps my plan as much as his, for he had begun increasingly to consult\r\nwith me, it was his forcefulness, his public voice, and his prestige among the\r\nNegro population that drove it to completion.\r\nEver since his first arrival in Springfield as a woolen merchant back in ’47, he\r\nhad attended the Zion Methodist Church, which was an abolitionist dissident\r\nchurch, half of whose parishioners were Negro, and he had preached there\r\nfrequently and from time to time had taught a Bible class. Consequently, he was\r\nwell-known and admired in the community he most wished to reach.\r\nWithin a day of our return from England, he secretly gave out to several of the\r\nmost outspoken and respected Negro men of the town that he would be holding\r\na series of late-night meetings at the Zion Methodist sanctuary, to which only\r\nNegro men and women were welcome. Further, they were to be Negroes who\r\ntrusted in God and were willing to keep their powder dry. “I wish to speak with\r\nand listen to Negro Christians willing and able to give a white man a hard\r\nknock. No others.",
    " Prepare yourselves by reading and pondering the meaning of\r\nJudges, chapter 7, verse 3. Also Deuteronomy, chapter 20, verse 8,” he\r\ninstructed.\r\nThe meetings, he told them, would concern several proposals which he would\r\nbe making solely to the people whose very lives were directly threatened by Mr.\r\nWebster’s cowardly capitulation to the slavers—his “compromise.” Father did\r\nnot wish to address or hear from anyone else. He wanted no Garrisonians. No\r\nAnti-Slavery Socialites. No white people at all. “Let the whites make their own\r\npolicy, as they always have. We must have our own.”\r\nIn a thoroughly racialized society, it was a strange kind of loneliness, and\r\nperhaps a peculiarly American one, to feel cut off from your own race. But in\r\nthose agonizing years before the War, for a small number of us, that’s what it\r\nhad come to. This matter of difference and sameness—the ways in which we\r\nwere different from the Negroes and the same as the whites, and, vice versa, the\r\nways in which we were the same as the Negroes and different from the whites—\r\nwas a vexing one. If a white person persists, as we did, in delineating and\r\ndefining these areas, soon he will find himself uncomfortable with people of\r\nboth races—with the one, because of his unwanted knowledge of their deepest\r\nloyalties and prejudices, for, as a fellow white, privy to their private race\r\nconversations and an adept at decoding those closed, tribal communiques, he\r\nunderstands their true motives and basic attitudes all too well; and\r\nuncomfortable with the other also, because, whenever he chooses to allow it, his\r\npale skin will keep him safe from their predators.\r\nIf you yourself are not a victim, you cannot claim to see the world as the\r\nvictim does.",
    " A man may have chosen deliberately to abandon one race—I will no\r\nlonger adhere to white people merely because I happen to be one myself, says\r\nthe good fellow—but if he is honest, he will quickly see that he is incapable of\r\nadhering to the other, too. Amongst Negroes, a white man is always white; they\r\ncannot forget it, and therefore neither can he. It’s only amongst whites that he\r\nsuddenly turns colorless, is privileged to forget his skin, is allowed to move\r\ninside it, as it were. But beware, because if he does forget his skin, he becomes\r\nlike them—he becomes another, specially privileged white man, a man who\r\nthinks the word “colored” does not apply to him. No, in America, whites are as\r\nmuch stuck with their skin color and bannered by it as the Negroes, and the\r\nIndians and Orientals, too. We may be a society founded on racial differences, a\r\nsociety poisoned at the root, perhaps, but we also aspire to be a democracy.\r\nThus, until we have truly become a democracy, every American, white as much\r\nas black, red, or yellow, lives not in his skin but on it. If one person is called\r\n“colored,” let all be colored.\r\nParadoxically, then, it is when a white person resists the privilege of turning\r\ncolorless that he frees himself, at least partially, from the sickness of racialism.\r\nIt’s the only way for a white man finally to clamber up and out of the pit of\r\nNegro slavery wherein this nation was unnaturally conceived and born in a\r\nbloody caul and raised into twisted, sick adulthood. He has to separate himself\r\nfrom the luxurious unconsciousness that characterizes his own race, without\r\nclaiming as his own the historical experience of the other. There is a price,\r\nthough. He pays with cold loneliness, an itching inner solitude, a permanent\r\nfeeling of separation from his tribe. He has to be willing to lose his own history\r\nwithout gaining another.",
    " He will feel like a man waking at dawn in a village that\r\nwas abandoned while he slept, all his kith and kin having departed during the\r\nnight for another, better place in an unknown land far, far away. All the huts\r\nand houses are empty, the chimneys are cold, and the doors hang open.\r\nIf I had not known that Father felt as I did, if I had not daily seen his brow\r\nfurrow with the pain of it, his shoulders slump with the fatigue of having\r\nconstantly to defeat the cynicism it proposed, had not heard him reduced to a\r\nsputter, his words all run dry of meaning, then I do not think that I could have\r\nwithstood that peculiar loneliness. Without Father’s steady example and\r\ncompanionship, I would have capitulated to my own pain, fatigue, and\r\nfrustration, and would either have given up and, lying to the whites, who sang\r\none siren song of race, cleaved to them; or, lying to myself, cleaved to the\r\nblacks, who sang another.\r\nAt the start of the first meeting held in the sanctuary of the Zion Methodist\r\nChurch, there were, to my surprise and pleasure, more than a hundred Negroes\r\npresent, although by the end Father had driven away more than half. Like\r\nGideon, he wished to separate the timid from the brave, and he did it with the\r\nfire of his rhetoric, the glare of his eye, and his insistence that if, in order to\r\nprotect their homes and families from the bounty-hunters, they were not\r\nprepared to die, then they should depart forthwith.\r\nThey were, most of them, respectable freedmen, with even a few freed women\r\nin attendance and several deacons of the church and members of the choir.",
    "\r\nThere were also numerous artisans and shopkeepers with whom we were well-\r\nacquainted—as Father made it a point to do business with Negroes whenever\r\npossible—and many young men whom I knew personally: roustabouts,\r\nstevedores, laborers, and factory hands with whom I had often spoken at\r\nabolition meetings. It was a crowd of earnest and intelligent people who\r\nunderstood perfectly the threat posed by this new slave-catching law, not only to\r\nthe slaves who succeeded in escaping from their bonds but also to these free\r\nNegroes themselves, many of whose parents had been born in freedom in the\r\nNorth and had never been within two hundred miles of a slave state.\r\nWell they knew that the color of their skin was now more than ever the mark\r\nof Cain. It was their brand, and with the passage of the Fugitive Law, they would\r\nhave to prove that somehow the brand had been burned into their flesh by\r\nmistake. And who could prove this? Virginia courts had displaced Massachusetts\r\ncourts. Any dark-skinned man, woman, or child, escaped slave or no, could be\r\nsworn a slave by a white man with forged papers and hauled back down South\r\nand sold off to the plantations there. At a single stroke of the pen, a free man or\r\nwoman could be converted into valuable property. This was surely the evilest\r\nalchemy ever invented.\r\nThere was shock and anger amongst the whites of the North, certainly. Daniel\r\nWebster’s “compromise” may well have made more abolitionists of previously\r\nacquiescent whites than twenty years of steady preaching had done—which\r\nsometimes caused Father to say that the law must have been a significant part of\r\nGod’s secret design. But this gave little comfort to the Negroes, as the outrage\r\nfelt by whites was mostly spent on stoking their own righteousness and warming\r\nthemselves before its fire. “Words, words, words,” Father said.",
    " “They won’t act\r\nuntil they themselves are physically or financially threatened,” he insisted.\r\nThis night, for the first time, Father preached violence in public. Moreover, he\r\npreached it to Negroes. Defensive violence, however. An over-fine distinction,\r\nsome might say, yet it was an important one to Father. He was still not ready to\r\ncarry the war straight to the oppressor, although he had begun to insist that, by\r\nvirtue of their support of slavery, white Southerners had established a condition\r\nof war against all Negroes and those whites who sided with them, and they had\r\ntherefore forfeited their right to live. “Pro-slavers are fair game,” Father had\r\nbegun to say. His actions would not catch up to his words, however, until we got\r\nto Kansas. For now, a merely defensive action would have to suffice.\r\nHe began by asking his audience how they proposed to keep the slave-catchers\r\nfrom coming openly into the town and, with aid and comfort provided by the\r\nSpringfield constabulary, taking off their sons and daughters to the cotton\r\nplantations of Mississippi and Alabama. How did they propose to prove that\r\ntheir child was not the same boy or girl who, according to the slave-catcher’s\r\nsworn statement, had run off with Harriet Tubman to an uncle and aunt in\r\nMassachusetts? The slave-catcher would have papers to support his case. He\r\nwould have depositions and warrants. How did they propose to support their\r\ncase? Remember, Father said, the slave-catcher can look at your innocent,\r\nbeautiful daughter and say, “That’s not Ruth Johnson of Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts! That’s Celia McNair of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, property of Mister\r\nJubal McNair!” How did they propose to answer him, when the word of a Negro\r\nman could no longer stand in a court of law against the word of a white?",
    "\r\nAnd how did they intend now to deal with the poor, starving escaped slave,\r\nwounded and bleeding from the rigors of his escape and half-frozen from the\r\nNew England cold, when he came late in the night scratching at their door,\r\nbegging to be let in and fed and warmed by their fire and hidden for a night\r\nfrom the hounds of hell bent on re-capturing him? That man, who might well\r\nturn out to be a brother or an elderly uncle, could be seized now and sent back\r\nwithout a Massachusetts trial. And they themselves could be arrested and jailed\r\nfor having stolen a Southern white man’s property—just as if his fine\r\nthoroughbred horse had been discovered blanketed and feeding inside their barn\r\nor his wife’s pearls hidden in their flour tin. “How do you intend to deal with\r\nthat?” Father asked.\r\nSeveral of the younger men grew restless and angry at these words, as if they\r\nfelt indicted by them, perhaps hearing Father’s questions as accusations, and\r\nthey stood up and began to edge towards the door. Others sat looking down at\r\ntheir hands as if ashamed, or crossed their arms over their chests and dropped\r\ntheir gaze, feigning deep thought, but mainly avoiding the eyes of their\r\nneighbors and of Father, especially.\r\nHis words surely caused them pain. He was saying nothing that they did not\r\nalready know, but he was saying it in a way that must only have reminded them\r\nof their terrible helplessness. This made some angry, others ashamed, but it must\r\nhave moved still others to some new and unexpected state of mind. The angry\r\nones muttered and scowled and began to leave the church. Those who were\r\nashamed averted their eyes. But the rest appeared to be waiting eagerly for\r\nFather to continue.\r\nIn the pew directly behind me sat brother John and his wife, Wealthy, the only\r\nother white people. I was seated in the front pew beside Father’s friend Mr.",
    "\r\nHarrison Wheeler, the tailor, a brave man who had tried to escape from slavery\r\nthree times before finally succeeding. Having taken the name of a dead cousin\r\nwho had purchased his own freedom some years past, Mr. Wheeler now lived as\r\na free man. I did not know his slave-name.\r\nI heard the door opening and closing—people were departing from the church\r\none by one. A general restlessness was sweeping over the crowd, as most of\r\nthose who remained shifted in their seats and cleared their throats, coughed, and\r\nmurmured to one another. Father stood at the front, silently facing us all, his\r\neyes glaring out beneath his heavy brow, mouth tight as an axe and jaw set, his\r\nhands fisted on his hips and feet apart like a man challenging another to a fight.\r\nWhen several moments had passed and no one any longer rose from his seat\r\neither to leave or to speak out, Father resumed his challenge, this time not by\r\nasking what his audience intended to do but by speaking of himself instead and\r\nwhat he would not do.\r\nHe and his sons and daughter-in-law, he said—and here, as if amongst the\r\ncrowd of black and brown faces ours needed identifying, he pointed straight at\r\nus, which made me hot with embarrassment—he and his family would not\r\nrecruit and lead a militia of our fellow white citizens to drive off the slave-\r\ncatchers. No, he would not go about the town arguing armed resistance with the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society folks, and he would not beg money from the gentry to\r\npurchase weapons, and he would not wheedle and whine with the Quakers and\r\nthe Presbyterians and the Methodists to load their muskets and protect their free\r\nNegro neighbors and open their doors to escaped slaves and defend them with\r\ntheir sanctified lives. No, he had done plenty of that, and look at what it had got\r\nthem. It had got them this cowardly Fugitive Law.",
    "\r\nFrom now on, he said, he would leave the white people to their own devices,\r\nto their speeches and meetings, to their proud denouncements and\r\nannouncements, their newspapers, their atheneums and churches, their poems\r\nand philosophical essays. Not for him, not for John Brown, to make soldiers of\r\nwhite poets, philosophers, clergymen, journalists, and clerks. Not for any man.\r\nHe knew a useless thing when he saw it. He, John Brown, though a white man,\r\nwould no longer speak to his fellow whites for the Negroes of Springfield or\r\nanywhere else. From now on, Negroes would have to speak for themselves.\r\nFor a long while, he went on in that manner, and it seemed to drive many of\r\nthe older people from the room and the more prosperous among them as well,\r\nsome of whom may have thought that there were, after all, quite a number of\r\nNegroes who had been speaking to whites for them for many long years now,\r\nspeaking, testifying, arguing, and praying for help and understanding with\r\nextraordinary eloquence and power, and they did not need to hear this white\r\nman signing off on them. Did he think they would beg him to speak for them?\r\nWhy should they? He was right: look at what it had got them.\r\nThere were now fewer than half a hundred remaining, somber-faced men of\r\nvarious ages and a few women here and there. Mr. Wheeler had not moved from\r\nmy side, I was glad to see, nor had any of the people whom I knew from\r\npersonal acquaintance to be brave and proud defenders of their few rights,\r\npeople who would under no circumstances shuffle and scrape before a white\r\nman. They leaned forward in their seats expectantly. There was in Father’s\r\nwords and manner something that they wanted badly to hear and see, and they\r\nwanted to hear and see it not only in a white man but in themselves.",
    " And,\r\nindeed, it was for us all now that he began to speak, substituting the word “we”\r\nfor the “you” and “I” of his previous harangue.\r\nWe must take up arms, he said, and we must become united amongst\r\nourselves, and we must be prepared to die in the defense of our homes, of our\r\nloved ones, and of our brethren who are in flight from the slave-catcher. We\r\nmust go home and take down the old musket or rabbit gun or the seldom-fired\r\nrevolver that we bought at auction, and we will clean and oil it and make sure\r\nthat the powder is dry and that we have bullets a-plenty, and then we must go\r\nout and fire it in our yard and in the fields beyond town, to test our weapon and\r\nto improve our aim, but also so that the general public will hear reports of it and\r\nknow that we are armed. And we will sharpen our knives and attach them to\r\npoles, and we will let ourselves be seen walking abroad in the bright of day and\r\ndark of night with gleaming pikes on our shoulders, so that the general public\r\nwill know that we mean to engage the enemy in close quarters, if necessary. And\r\nwe will let it out that, in our houses, in the windows above the doors, we have\r\nput large cauldrons ready to be filled with scalding hot water that can be poured\r\ndown upon the slave-catcher when he comes with his writs and warrants and\r\npounds on our door demanding entry. That way the general public will know\r\nthat we will employ any means necessary to defend our homes and whoever\r\nhappens to be inside them.\r\n“We must form a cadre;’ he declared, “a rock-hard core at the center of our\r\ncommunity. It shall be a League of Gileadites! And its members’ names shall be\r\nknown only to those of us who have taken an oath that, in the defense of our\r\ncommunity and our enslaved brethren who have put themselves under our\r\nprotection, in their names, we are prepared to die!",
    " Whenever the cry goes out\r\nfrom anyone in the Negro community for help against the slave-catcher, we will,\r\nlike the old Concord Minutemen, drop our work or rise from our beds and grab\r\nup our weapons and come a-running!” No one who was himself not a Gileadite,\r\nhe explained, would know which man among us had taken this vow, and thus no\r\none would know which man among us was ready to die and was not afraid even\r\nof hanging for his actions. A single one of us standing invisible in a crowd of\r\nNegroes would make every person in the crowd more powerful, for all would be\r\nseen as potential Gileadites. We must let it out, therefore, without naming\r\nnames, that some among the Gileadites were white men and some were Negro\r\nwomen, some were young and some were old, so that no single, small group\r\ncould be separated from the population and persecuted generally. “In unity there\r\nis strength!” he stated. “And God will protect us only if we are willing to protect\r\nourselves and each other.”\r\nThere were a number of Amens and other shows of enthusiasm from the\r\npeople, whereupon Father, without changing the stern expression of his face,\r\nextended his open hands, palms up, at his sides, as was his habit when\r\nparticularly pleased with himself. Several men in the room, including Mr.\r\nWheeler, had stood and, wishing to speak, were waiting, hats in hand, for Father\r\nto acknowledge and call on them. “Anyone who wants to be heard may come up\r\nhere now and speak,” Father said. “If there is a Gideon among us, let him come\r\nforward now, and let him forthwith divide the timid from the brave.”\r\nMr.",
    " Wheeler and the others hitched a bit and sat back down, and when no one\r\ncame forward, as Father knew they would not, for all those who would have\r\nopposed him or would have wished to wrest leadership from him had already\r\ndeparted from the group, he walked to the further end of one of the nearly\r\nempty pews and himself sat down.\r\nA moment or two passed in silence, as if everyone were waiting for the arrival\r\nof an important visitor, and then Father rose again from his seat and returned to\r\nthe front. “We will let the Lord separate us out,”he declared in a low, calm voice.\r\n“Therefore, let us go to our homes now, and there shall each one of us pray\r\nalone for guidance in this matter. And whosoever returns to this place tomorrow\r\nnight at this same hour, let him come prepared to swear the Oath of the\r\nGileadites, which I myself shall be the first to take and then shall deliver to each\r\nof thee, one by one.” At that, he marched down the center aisle of the sanctuary\r\nand passed out the door to the vestry beyond and into the cold autumn night,\r\nand the rest of us followed.\r\nFather had inspired and moved us beyond measure, it appeared, and me he had\r\nmoved beyond expectation. It was as if he had been speaking for me, and I had\r\nthrough him become wonderfully articulate and clear. It was as if my crippled\r\narm had been magically healed and, full-faced, I had stood forward, bright and\r\nchallenging, my two arms extended for the first time in public, and, speaking\r\nbefore an audience of hesitant, frightened, and angry people, an audience of\r\nsuspicious Negroes, I had succeeded in transforming myself into an old-time,\r\nBiblical prophet capable of leading men into a holy war, a war in which, as a\r\nresult of my words, men and women were prepared to sacrifice themselves for\r\nthe lives of others and for the greater glory of God.\r\nFather’s thoughts and beliefs were mine.",
    " He had spoken for me, or, rather, I\r\nhad spoken through him, and it seemed to me then to have occurred not because\r\nI had contrived for him to do it or had subtly managed him somehow—although\r\nin a certain light I suppose that my aid to him and reassurance could have been\r\nconstrued as such—but because now, for the first time, I was no longer resisting\r\nhis will, no longer holding back from his calls for action, action, action. I had\r\nfinally taken him at his word, the word which he had been laying in the porches\r\nof my ears since I’d drawn my first breath, and now his word was mine, his\r\npersonal power mine, his ease with speech, his natural movement, his hard, gray\r\neye, his intelligence and imagination, mine!\r\nI remained, of course, still the hulking, crippled, red-headed country boy, the\r\nsame shy, inarticulate bumpkin as before. But now all that was like a clever\r\ndisguise designed to hide and shelter the real person inside—a man who, neither\r\nwhite nor Negro, was dangerous. A man who, whenever necessary, could step out\r\nof the shadows where in silence he silently labored his days away and suddenly\r\nstand revealed as a warrior for the Lord, a man of God who would inspire and\r\nlead God’s chosen people out of Egypt into the promised land, and who would\r\ndo it even as he denied he was doing it, who would be Moses while claiming\r\nmerely to be Aaron. Whom or what we love, although it can never be our reason\r\nfor loving them, we become. Without his love of God, my father, I saw, would\r\nhave been a pitiful man. But in giving himself over to God, Father had become\r\nmany times larger and more powerful a man than he could ever have been\r\notherwise. Now I, too, having finally come to love my father as totally as he\r\nloved God—I, too, was no longer pitiful.",
    "\r\nThat same night, we adjourned to the rooms where John and Wealthy had been\r\nliving—since the removal to North Elba, Father had not maintained living\r\nquarters in Springfield, and consequently he and I had been sleeping in the office\r\nof Brown & Perkins’s empty warehouse. There Father instructed me to write up a\r\nstatement of advice and principles which he could present to the Negroes\r\ntomorrow night and a draft of a pledge. He had arrived over the years at a high\r\nestimation of my literary abilities, although he had little more to go on than my\r\nletters and the help I gave him with his own. He also knew that I believed his\r\nstyle to be on the eccentric side of my own. Reluctantly, he had come to agree\r\nwith me, and thus he frequently enjoyed employing me as a kind of village\r\nscribe, in which he was the village. He would say aloud what he meant or\r\nwished to mean, pacing back and forth, hands clasped behind him, brow\r\nfurrowed in thought, while I scratched away with my pen, setting down his\r\nthoughts and intentions in language that I hoped would be readily understood by\r\nthe man or woman to whom those thoughts and intentions were directed, a\r\nperson who, with a transcription of Father’s own words in hand, would very\r\nlikely have been puzzled or merely annoyed.\r\nWith his composition “Sambo’s Mistakes,” Father had tried working alone, and\r\nI think that afterwards he was sorry he had done so and in time blamed its\r\nfailure to be published on his inability to set down on the page the true nature of\r\nhis thoughts. Since then, whenever he wished to make a written statement of\r\nany importance or delicacy, he’d taken to calling on me. Increasingly, this job of\r\nscribe had become a pleasure for me—it gave me, naturally, a certain degree of\r\nimportance not otherwise available, and it provided me with the chance to voice\r\nsome of my own thoughts and beliefs as well.",
    "\r\nFather talked and tried out first one sentence and then another, rejecting,\r\nediting, retracing his words, struggling to make his statement to the Negroes. He\r\npaced the length and breadth of the sitting room and rumbled on into the cold\r\nautumn night, while John and Wealthy slept in the adjacent chamber, and I sat\r\nat the little table and by the dim, flickering light of a Nantucket lamp, wrote\r\ndown much of what he said and most of what he meant or wanted to say.\r\nIt was nearly dawn before we had a preamble, which we entitled “Words of\r\nAdvice,” and a pledge, entitled “Agreement;” whereupon we adjourned to the\r\nBrown & Perkins office and slept a few hours on our cots, before having to\r\ncommence the day’s work, which then consisted mostly of writing letters to\r\nattorneys and creditors and attempting to find a tenant for the warehouse who\r\nwould take over Brown & Perkins’s lease.\r\nThat evening, Father and I—this time without John and Wealthy, for she was\r\nnewly pregnant, and they would soon be departing for their farm in Ohio and\r\nthus could not be a part of our work here—returned to the Zion Methodist\r\nChurch, where we were joined by most of the Negroes who had remained until\r\nthe end of the meeting the evening before. They numbered thirty-two men and\r\nnine women, the majority of them between thirty and forty years of age, with a\r\nsprinkling of very young and elderly men among them. Seen together like that,\r\ngrim-visaged, muscular, and healthy, their dark brown and black faces stern and\r\ndetermined, they constituted a formidable-looking force. I felt proud to be\r\nassociated with them.\r\nMore than half of the company were friends and acquaintances of ours, the\r\nbest among the blacks of Springfield. I was glad to see Mr. Harrison Wheeler still\r\nthere, and Deacon Samuels, also the apothecary Mr.",
    " Minahan and his teenaged\r\nson, and several of the fellows who at different times had worked alongside me\r\nin the warehouse sorting and baling wool, trustworthy young men with stout\r\narms and strong backs and anger to spare. Most of the Negroes who were lucky\r\nenough to be properly employed or have a profession were engaged at a level\r\nbelow their natural or acquired abilities, and as a result a Negro apothecary\r\noften had the intelligence and many of the skills of a white physician, and a\r\nNegro laborer was frequently the equal of a white foreman. Thus Father’s\r\ndetermination to do business with Negroes was based on no condescending\r\ndesire to provide charity; it was, as he said, practical. And he was rarely\r\ndisappointed by them—nowhere near as often as when he had to employ or deal\r\nfinancially with white people, who he believed were more likely than blacks to\r\ncheat or cut corners.\r\nWhen everyone had been seated and the door closed and, at Father’s\r\ninstructions, bolted, we began with a singing of the hymn “Broad Is the Path\r\nThat Leads to Death,” a favorite of mine. Then Father announced that he would\r\npresent to us a statement which he had drawn up. Holding the paper close to his\r\neyes, like a court clerk reading a judge’s sentence, he commenced to read.\r\nWords of Advice! To the Springfield, Massachusetts, branch of the United\r\nStates League of Gileadites. Adopted November 15,1850, as written and\r\nrecommended by John Brown.\r\nUnion is Strength!\r\nNothing so charms the American people as personal bravery.\r\nWitness the case of Cinque, he of everlasting memory, who seized the\r\nslave-ship Amistad, and the outpouring of sympathy and interest that\r\nfollowed hard upon it.",
    " The trial for life of one so bold and to some extent a\r\nsuccessful man, for having defended his rights as a man in good earnest,\r\naroused more sympathy amongst whites throughout the nation than the\r\naccumulated wrongs and sufferings of more than the three millions of our\r\nsubmissive Negro population.\r\nWe need not mention our American white people’s response to the Greeks\r\nwho are now struggling valiantly against the oppressive Turks, their\r\nsympathy for the Poles against mighty Russia, and for the Hungarians\r\nagainst Austria and Russia combined, in order to prove this. The truth is, no\r\njury can be found in the Northern states that would convict a man, whether\r\nblack or white, for defending his legitimate rights to the last extremity.\r\nThat this is well understood by Southern Congressmen, who now appear to\r\ngovern us, we see by their insistence that the right of trial by jury should\r\nnot be granted to the fugitive slave.\r\nThen he recited several sentences which I had tried to excise but which Father\r\nhad insisted on including, for he could not leave off giving advice of this sort,\r\nnot just to Negroes, but to everyone. Although he assured me that it would be\r\nobvious to all that he was criticizing white people, not black, I knew how it\r\nwould sound to his audience, for I had endured a form of the same hectoring\r\nlecture for my whole life. But giving unwanted advice was his characteristic tic,\r\nand there was no avoiding it, so I cringed and awaited its passing.\r\nColored people have ten times the number of fast friends among the whites as\r\nthey suppose.",
    " But they would have ten times the number they have now, were\r\nblacks but half as much in earnest to secure their dearest rights as they are to\r\nape the follies and extravagances of their white neighbors and to indulge in idle\r\nshow, in ease, and in luxury, if Negroes in America were to demonstrate in their\r\nprivate and public behavior the virtues which whites claim to admire but seem for\r\nthe most part unable to practice themselves, of temperance, modesty, and\r\ndecorum in all things, thrift, and charity, then they would acquire for themselves\r\nthe widespread admiration of many of those who today revile and scorn them for\r\ntheir frivolity and wastefulness.\r\nSoon, happily, his scolding done, he was again delivering his charge to us.\r\nShould one of our number be arrested, all the rest of us must collect together\r\nand sternly surround the officers and constables as quickly as possible, so as to\r\noutnumber and intimidate our adversaries, even those who were not present and\r\nonly afterwards heard rumor of our seriousness of purpose and our surprising\r\nnumbers. And no able-bodied man shall appear on the ground unequipped and\r\nwithout his weapons, and thus his intentions, clearly exposed to view. Your\r\nmusket and your sword, you may say, are to exterminate varmints. Let our\r\nadversary ponder whether of two legs or four.\r\nLet that much be understood beforehand by all who see us abroad in the town,\r\nbut our actual plans must be known only to ourselves, with the understanding\r\nthat all traitors, wherever caught and proven to be guilty, must die. Yet we must\r\nnot forget the admonition of the Lord to Gideon, “Whosoever is fearful or afraid,\r\nlet him return and part early from Mount Gilead.",
    "” That is, give all cowards an\r\nopportunity to show their cowardice early, on condition of holding their peace\r\nand their tongues, for while we do not want them among us when in battle, our\r\nvictory must be a victory for all.\r\nNow this is most important to success. When the moment of confrontation with\r\nthe enemy arrives, do not delay for a moment once you have made ready to\r\nstrike him down! You will lose all resolution if you do. And let the first blow be\r\nthe signal for all to engage. And once engaged, we shall not do our deadly work\r\nby halves. We will make clean work of our enemies, as one would butcher a steer\r\n—and be sure you meddle not with any others. Choose wisely who will be cut\r\ndown, then do it swiftly to him alone. By going about our bloody business\r\nquickly and quietly, we will get the job done with efficiency, and the number that\r\nan uproar would bring together cannot collect and stop us.\r\nWe will have the advantage anyhow of those who would come out against us,\r\nfor they will be wholly unprepared with either equipment or matured plans. All\r\nwith them will be confusion and terror. Then our enemies will be slow to attack\r\nus after we have done up the work so nicely. And if, after they have re-gathered\r\ntheir thoughts and the terror has passed, should they still decide to attack us,\r\nthey will have to encounter our white friends as well, for we may safely calculate\r\non a division appearing among the whites and by that means may get to an\r\nhonorable parley.\r\nBe firm, determined, and cool, but let it be understood that we are not to be\r\ndriven to desperation without making it as awful a job to others as it is to us.\r\nGive them to know distinctly that those who live in wooden houses should not\r\nthrow fire and that we are more able to suffer and make pay than are our white\r\nneighbors, for our very lives are at stake.",
    "\r\nAlso, after effecting a rescue, if you are assailed, we must not go to our own\r\nhouses but make straight for the houses of our most prominent and influential\r\nwhite friends, carrying with us our wives and small children. This will fasten\r\nupon the whites the suspicion of being connected with the blacks and will compel\r\nthem to make a common cause with us, whether they would otherwise live up to\r\ntheir previous professions of sympathy or not. They would have then no choice in\r\nthe matter. Some of their own volition will doubtless prove themselves true, most\r\nothers would flinch, but either way, we would be guilty only of taking them at\r\ntheir earlier words.\r\nIn the courtroom where a trial is going on which is more show than trial, we\r\ncan disrupt the proceedings and effect a rescue if we make a tumult—by burning\r\ngunpowder freely in paper packages, if you cannot think of a better way to make\r\na momentary alarm. And might not a lasso be applied to a slave-catcher for once\r\nwith good effect? Well we might \\n the process give one or more of our enemies a\r\nproper hoist, but m such a case the prisoner will need to take the hint at once\r\nand bestir himself, and his friends in the dock should use the occasion to improve\r\nthe opportunity of a general rush.\r\nHold onto your weapons and never be persuaded to leave them, part with\r\nthem, or have them far away from you. Stand by one another and by your\r\nfriends whilst a drop of blood remains in you or a breath of air. And, finally, be\r\nhanged on the scaffold or a gallows tree, if you must, but tell no tales out of\r\nschool. Make no confession!\r\nRemember and say it over and over, union is strength, union is strength’. But\r\nregardless, without well-digested arrangements such as these, nothing to any good\r\npurpose is likely to be demanded, let the demand be never so great.",
    " Witness the\r\nhundreds of cases of capture and return to slavery, regardless of the protests\r\nraised afterwards, when there was no well-defined plan of operation or suitable\r\npreparations made and sworn to beforehand.\r\nBy these proposed means, the desired end may be effectually secured. Namely,\r\nthe enjoyment of our inalienable rights.\r\nTo hear my written words spoken in his resonating, public-hall voice by Father\r\nto a sober-faced audience of people who, because of those words, were made\r\nready to take up arms and slay the enemy was wonderfully thrilling to me, and I\r\nfelt the blood course up and down my arms and could scarcely repress a smile\r\nfrom my lips. I trembled with joy, as much for the meaning of the words and the\r\npictures they painted in my own mind of making quick and bloody work of my\r\nenemies, as for the occasion of hearing Father speak them; and when, in that\r\nsmall, dimly lit sanctuary, Father called out to the crowd of us, “Who will come\r\nforward and sign an agreement to adhere to my words of advice?” I was the first\r\nto stand and deliver. On either side of me, other men and women were standing\r\nand stepping to the front also, until in a moment nearly every person in the\r\nroom had joined me there.\r\nFather said, “Now, let me say it again. Whosoever is fearful or afraid, let him\r\ndepart from us. But if ye depart from us, say nothing of what ye have heard\r\nhere. For ye have also heard what shall be done by us with traitors.” There were\r\nat that point a final few who made for the door, unbolted it, and disappeared\r\ninto the night, leaving behind still more than thirty warriors to bind ourselves\r\ntogether and march behind Gideon against the Midianites.\r\n“The Lord hath instructed us to reduce ourselves to this number,” Father said,\r\n“so that when we have accomplished our task, we will not say, ‘Mine own hand\r\nhath saved me.",
    "’ We must thank only the Lord,” he pronounced, and many in the\r\ngroup sang out, “Praise the Lord! Praise Him!”\r\nWhereupon Father said, “This which I shall now read to thee is the Agreement,\r\nand when I have finished, come forward one by one and sign on this sheet of\r\npaper below it, so that we shall be bound together in this work as brothers and\r\nsisters, sworn to the death of every one of us.” He told us then to place our right\r\nhands over our hearts, which we did, and in a loud, clear voice, he read the\r\nAgreement, which, though I had myself written the words for him in the late\r\nhours of the previous night, sounded to me as fresh and new as if I had never\r\nheard them before.\r\nAs legitimate citizens of the United States of America, trusting in a just and\r\nmerciful God, whose spirit and all-powerful aid we humbly implore, we pledge\r\nthat we will ever be true to the flag of our beloved country, always acting under\r\nit. We, whose names are hereunto fixed, do constitute ourselves a branch of the\r\nUnited States League of Gileadites. We pledge that we will provide ourselves at\r\nonce with suitable implements of war, and will aid those who do not possess the\r\nmeans, if any such are disposed to join us, to acquire and do the same. We\r\nfurther invite every colored person whose heart is engaged in the performance of\r\nour work, whether male or female, young or old, to join us in that work, which is\r\nthe defense of our Negro brethren against the man-stealers and any of those\r\ncowards who would aid and abet them. All able-bodied men and women shall be\r\nprepared to die in this effort. The duty of the aged, infirm, and young members\r\nof the League shall be to give instant notice to all other members in case of an\r\nattack upon any of our people.",
    " Until some trial of courage and talent of able-\r\nbodied members shall enable us to elect officers from those who have rendered\r\nthe most important services, we agree to have no officers, except a treasurer and\r\nsecretary pro tern. Nothing but wisdom and undaunted courage, efficiency, and\r\ngeneral good conduct shall in any way influence us in electing our officers.\r\nFather laid the paper on the low table where normally flowers for Sabbath\r\nservices were placed, flattened it with his left hand, and, saying, “So sworn, John\r\nBrown” wrote his name with a visible flourish. I then stepped to the table and\r\ntook the pen from him, and saying the words “So sworn, Owen Brown,” with\r\ntrembling hand wrote my name below his. One by one, the rest came forward,\r\nfollowing the procedure exactly. So sworn, Alexander Washington. So sworn,\r\nHarrison Wheeler. So sworn, Shadrach Benchforth. So sworn, Mary Benchforth.\r\nSo sworn, Felicity Moone. So sworn, Ebidiah Smith. And on down the line, until\r\nall of us had sworn and signed.\r\nThen, bearing the document in hand, Father walked from behind the table\r\nwhere he had stood throughout and came to stand beside us, facing the nave of\r\nthe sanctuary, where a small cross was attached high on the white-washed wall,\r\nand he led us briefly in prayer, humbly beseeching the Lord to protect us in this\r\nmighty task. “Make us hard, Lord, hard, like a stone, so that we shall crush and\r\nmake bleed the teeth of the slavers when they bite down upon us” he prayed.\r\nWhen he had finished, we all said our amens, and the Gileadites somberly filed\r\nout to the vestry and into the night. Father and I lingered behind to put out the\r\nlamps and candles, and when everyone else was gone and we were alone in the\r\ndarkness of the vestry, I said to him, “Who’ll be the treasurer and secretary pro\r\ntern? And what will his duties be?",
    "” I couldn’t see much use for there being a\r\ntreasurer, as there were no dues or other monies involved with the League, and I\r\nwas unsure of what a secretary would do, as it was difficult to imagine a secret\r\nsociety engaged in much correspondence or keeping minutes. But the night\r\nbefore, when composing the Agreement, I had been ordered by Father to allow\r\nfor that one officer, and so, without understanding, I had written it in. Now it\r\nseemed important. Naturally, I myself wished to be that person but, because of\r\nthe honor it implied, dared not hope that the job would fall to me.\r\n“The treasurer and secretary will safeguard these documents,” he answered,\r\nand he placed the Words of Advice and the Agreement with the signatures into\r\nmy hand. “He will not deliver them to the enemy, Owen, even under pain of\r\ndeath. And when the time comes, as it surely will, that we receive monetary\r\nsupport for our work from our white friends, he will record such funds as we\r\nreceive and will control their expenditure.”\r\nI said nothing, and when Father had closed the church doors behind us and we\r\nhad stepped down to the dark, deserted street, I carefully rolled the documents\r\nso as not to crease them, and we began walking side by side towards the\r\nwarehouse. Finally, I could stand it no longer, and I said to him, “So are you\r\nmaking me the sole officer for the Gileadites?”\r\n“For now, yes. I’ll speak of it first to the others, but I’m sure they’ll agree to it.\r\nThere’s no one better qualified for the task. Do you mind?” he asked.\r\n“No. No, I don’t mind,” I answered off-handedly.\r\nBut I remember thinking, At last! It has begun! At last, the killing has begun!\r\nThe wind outside my cabin has let up, and I hear mice skittering in the darkness\r\nacross the warped, dried-out floors.",
    " Their bodies against the boards—though\r\neach weighs less than an ounce of fur and twigged bone, a mere thimbleful of\r\nflesh—seem nonetheless immeasurably realer than mine, weightier, as if the bit\r\nof stale, dusty air displaced by their tiny bodies and disrupted by their rapid\r\nmovements alongside the crumbling walls exceeds in volume anything my body\r\nis capable of filling or disturbing. Yet I know that my presence, despite its frail\r\nethereality, alarms them. The animals see and hear me the way they see and\r\nhear an ominous shift in the weather long before it occurs. I am like a ghost and\r\nin the course of this relation have traveled far and wide and back and forth in\r\ntime, a dark spirit growing steadily darker, transported by memory and\r\narticulation and the compulsive direction of my thought. I can no longer say,\r\nMiss Mayo, whether I am in my cabin now in Altadena or our old house in ’89 in\r\nNorth Elba. Darkness merges time and place.\r\nAbove me, in the bare attic room where Ruth and I and the younger children\r\nand Lyman Epps and his wife, Ellen, slept on our pallets, divided one from the\r\nother, males from females, like Shakers by a curtain on a string, I hear the dry\r\nrustle of squirrels, or perhaps it is a pair of raccoons—it’s the shuffling gait of\r\nanimals that have wintered inside, and now that spring has at last come to these\r\nnorthern Adirondack hills, they have mated, and the female has dropped a litter\r\nof cubs in her nest of sticks and leaves in the leeward corner, where since\r\nNovember she slumbered protected against the arctic snows and freezing winds.\r\nMy sudden, unexpected presence here after years away has frightened the poor\r\ncreatures. I hear the female trying to move her cubs to some place up there in\r\nthe attic where she feels they will be safe, carrying them in her mouth one by\r\none to the corner furthest from where she senses me.",
    " She senses the presence of\r\nan alien creature, possibly human, a killer, in one of the two rooms below.\r\nAlthough I am still and it is dark and she can see and hear no one, can smell\r\nno sour human body, no tobacco smoke, no lamp, no guttering candle,\r\nnonetheless she knows that something like a human being, something like a\r\nkiller, has entered this long-abandoned building and stands in silence now in the\r\nmiddle of the room below. She knows that there must be one of the killers, a\r\nhuman being, down here. The disturbance in the musty air can be nothing else,\r\nwhere for years there has been no human—no men with their dogs, no children\r\neven, with their small deadly weapons—except occasionally during the daylight\r\nhours, when a crowd of humans, male and female, smelling foully of death and\r\nmaking loud grinding and barking noises with their feet and mouths, come\r\ninside and stomp around for a while, as if contemplating taking up residence\r\nhere, and then leave again.\r\nDon’t fret, little mother, I’ll not hurt or hinder you. I may remain down here\r\nfor a long while, perhaps for as many years as this otherwise abandoned old\r\nstructure stands; perhaps longer, or maybe I’ll stay only for this one night, I can’t\r\nknow; but don’t you worry, you tiny, frightened mice and agitated raccoons and\r\nsquirrels, and even you porcupines under the house gnawing on the rafters\r\nbeneath my feet—all my killing is done now. The killing is finished. You needn’t\r\nfear me, even you black bears whom I hear cough and growl outside in the yard,\r\nprowling the now-deserted site for refuse, quarreling over a few chicken bones\r\nand chunks of old bread tossed aside by the humans when they left this\r\nafternoon at the end of their ceremonies. Even the wolves slinking back down\r\nthe valley from the ridge behind the house and the lion alone on the mountain\r\nneed not fear my presence here.",
    " Every living creature is safe from me now.\r\nBut if they understood these words, no matter; they would take no comfort\r\nfrom them. They know us too well, our terrible propensity for killing. Of all the\r\nanimals on this planet, we are surely the nastiest, the most deceitful, the most\r\nmurderous and vile. Despite our God, or because of Him. Both. Our only virtue\r\nsometimes seems to be that we are as cruel and violent to one another as we are\r\nto the other species, whom we slay and devour, or slay for the pure pleasure of it\r\nand toss aside, or simply slay because it’s expedient and heap up their corpses. I\r\nwish to warn them and to comfort them.\r\nA pathetic wish; it serves no purpose. Sharp as their ears may be, they cannot\r\nhear these words, let alone understand them. I can warn and comfort no one, not\r\neven the dumb animals.\r\nIt’s just as well not to try, for all I am now is a story being told for all practical\r\npurposes by a man whose only possibility for positioning himself to speak it rests\r\nwith his imagining this old house, the overgrown yard that surrounds it, the\r\nhuge, gray stone yonder, and the yellowing bones that lie in boxes buried in the\r\nhard ground beside it. I’m but one of the thousand stories of the mystery of\r\nbeing human, and all the other animals know that story already and know the\r\nnine hundred ninety-nine more; it’s why they fear us: they know our nature, and\r\ndon’t require a ghost to tell it.\r\nSince the day I left this house for Kansas and beyond, I have wanted to be back\r\nhere again—but not for this. I never in my lifetime wanted it to be true that the\r\nmystery surrounding my father’s life and death, the questions concerning his\r\ncharacter and motives, even the question of his sanity, lay here in this house on\r\nthis hallowed plot of ground.",
    " Though I better than anyone alive knew the\r\nanswer to all those questions, which tormented so many good men and women,\r\ntormented everyone who loved him for himself and for what he did, I still during\r\nmy lifetime did not say aloud what was the truth, not to myself and not to\r\nanyone else. I loved him, too, and loved what he did. So I kept silent and hoped\r\nthat the questions would end, or that they needed no answers. I hoped that a\r\nmystery was sufficient.\r\nAfter Harpers Ferry, I went away; I ran as far as the continent ran, to where\r\nthere was nothing further than the endless, blue Pacific; and climbed a mountain\r\nthere and built a cabin; and said nothing: nothing to the journalists, who found\r\nout from my brothers and sisters where I had hidden myself and came\r\nclambering up my mountain in Altadena to interview me, nothing to the\r\nhistorians, who mailed me long detailed lists of questions, which I tossed into\r\nthe fire in my iron stove; nothing to Father’s old abolitionist friends and\r\nsupporters, who came to my cabin seeking answers and left feeling pity for what\r\nthe war against slavery and the deaths of my beloved father and brothers had\r\ndone to me. I did not even speak of those matters with my brothers and sisters\r\nthemselves, those who survived into old age with me, when in later years they\r\narranged to gather together now and again in one of the houses they had\r\nscattered to, on a Fourth of July, sometimes on a Thanksgiving or Christmas\r\nholiday, and I would trundle down from my hermit’s shack and travel the many\r\nhundreds of miles to their homes, where late in the evening they would share\r\ntheir memories of Kansas, of the work before Kansas, and of Harpers Ferry. At\r\nthose gatherings they all thought me shy, inarticulate, perhaps not as intelligent\r\nas they, as they always had anyhow, and they were not wrong.",
    " But that did not\r\nmean that I did not know the truth about Father and why he did the great, good\r\nthings and the bad, and why so much of what he did was, at bottom,\r\nhorrendous, shocking, was wholly evil.\r\nWithin a few days of the swearing of the Gileadites in Springfield, our little army\r\nwas dissolved. Or, more to the point, Father abruptly withdrew from its\r\ncommand and took me with him, leaving the Negro Gileadites to their own\r\ndevices and stratagems, which, happily for them, turned out to be sufficient unto\r\nthe day. But to be cast down from such a height of excitement and anticipation,\r\nas I was cast down by Father, was truly agonizing for me. In those days, my\r\nparticular closeness to Father and the intensity and whole-heartedness with\r\nwhich I embraced his plans and dreams of carrying the battle straight to the\r\nslaveholders separated me from my brothers, and I could not pass it off the way\r\nJohn did when, within a few days of Father’s and my somberly and\r\nceremoniously pledging ourselves to defend with our life’s blood the fugitive\r\nslaves, the Old Man, as was his wont, turned his attention suddenly elsewhere—\r\nto the sorry business of Brown & Perkins, as it happened. John simply shrugged\r\nhis shoulders and set off on his own business, as he and Jason had so often done\r\nin the past. I, however, was crushed with disappointment and bitter frustration.\r\nAnd I was vexed with Father, more so than I had ever been before.\r\nLooking back now, these many years later, I can see with some sympathy how\r\nFather was sorely conflicted then between what he saw as his obligations to his\r\nfamily and his creditors and to Mr. Perkins, who had stood by him for so long,\r\nand what he saw as his duty to oppose slavery.",
    " I was, of course, not so divided,\r\nbut there was no place else I could go to wage war than with Father, no army in\r\nwhich to enlist but his, no one to follow into battle but him. When he decided\r\nonce again to let the fight go, all I could do was gnash my teeth in rage and\r\nsharpen my long knife and clean my gun and dream of spilling blood.\r\nI might have stayed on in Springfield, defying Father’s order to return to North\r\nElba and run the farm there, marching instead and on my own with the\r\nGileadites—who, as it turned out, because of the fear they aroused simply by\r\nvirtue of rumor and the sight of armed Negro men at the Springfield railroad\r\nstation and on the streets, never did have the opportunity for an actual, bloody\r\nconfrontation with the slave-catchers. Wisely, the man-stealers and their cohorts\r\nsought their prey elsewhere. But without Father at my side, I knew that I was\r\nnot especially wanted by the Negroes anyhow. To them, I was merely one of the\r\nsons of Captain Brown, as they sometimes called him. I was the big, shy, red-\r\nheaded fellow who ran errands for his illustrious sire. Any light on my face was\r\nreflected light.\r\nNights, as I lay in my cot and fumed over what I regarded as Father’s\r\ndereliction, his defection even, I dreamed up bloody scenes to give vent to my\r\nwrath and my longing for battle. I aimed down the barrel of my gun and fired\r\ninto the chest of the slave-catcher standing over the prostrate form of a fugitive.\r\nI sneaked up behind an auctioneer on his way to market with a bound gang of\r\nhuman chattel, and in full view of his victims reached around his neck and\r\nslashed his throat with my knife, retrieved his keys, and with my bloodied hands\r\nset the men and women loose from their fetters and led them into the woods and\r\nup into the hills.",
    " Visions of carnage and revenge filled my mind and strangely\r\npleased me, easing me, calming my turbulent thoughts—so that I could\r\neventually accede to Father’s wishes and return to North Elba.\r\n“I very much oppose having to go back there,” I told him the night before I\r\ndeparted from Springfield. “I want to stay here and fight alongside the\r\nGileadites.” We were in the office of Brown & Perkins, and I had taken to my cot,\r\nprepared for sleep, while he worked on at the desk by lamplight, dashing off\r\nmore letters that begged for time, for patience and understanding, for merciful\r\ndelays of prosecution, that promised eventual, full payment, complete\r\nclarification and accounting, justice and restitution. This sort of letter he wrote\r\nhimself, and he pointedly did not want me as his scribe.\r\nHe put down his pen and looked at me with irritation. “Owen, the Negroes\r\ndon’t need you here. They can protect themselves as well without you as with\r\nyou. No one needs you here now. I don’t. I need you to be with your mother and\r\nthe rest of the family. We’ve gone over this. The winter is bearing down on\r\nthem, and they’re suffering because of the absence of a man who can run the\r\nplace.”\r\n“What about Lyman? He’s there, he’s a man.”\r\n“It’s not the same, Owen. I can’t be there myself, because of these infernal\r\ncourt cases. You know that. The family needs one of us, and it’s you, or it’ll have\r\nto be me, to get them safely through the winter and put the place ready for\r\nspring. We don’t want next year to go so hard. Think of your poor brothers and\r\nsisters, Owen. The babies. Think of your mother.”\r\n“She’s not my mother,” I shot back.\r\n“We’ll not go into that;’ he said curtly. “You’re angry with me, I know, for\r\nhaving to go off like this, for my sending you north. But you should deliver it to\r\nme, who deserves it. Don’t ship it to someone who doesn’t deserve it.",
    "” He turned\r\nabruptly back to his work. Then, after a few moments, he paused and without\r\nlooking at me seemed to be reversing himself, for he offered to let me stay on in\r\nSpringfield, if I wished.\r\nI sat up in my cot, not quite believing him. But then he added that I could also\r\ngo to Ohio with John and Wealthy, or join Fred and Jason at Mr. Perkins’s place.\r\nI could go anyplace I chose. Accompany him to Boston to help prepare his\r\nlawyer. Follow him to Pittsburgh for more of the same. Even go off to California\r\nwith all the other young fools and dig for gold, if I wanted. Follow the elephant.\r\n“It’s your choice,” he said. “But wherever you choose to go,” he reminded me,\r\nstill without lifting his eyes from the paper before him, “if you don’t go to North\r\nElba, you’ll be abandoning your duty.”\r\nBesides, he pointed out, I had no money, no house, no land. Or had I some\r\nprivate wealth, and he somehow had not noticed? And I had no trade, other than\r\nfarming and the keeping of sheep. Or had I been taking instruction by mail in\r\nbusiness like John, or horticulture like Jason? If not, would I perhaps like to hire\r\nmyself out as a day-laborer here in Springfield? And where would I sleep at\r\nnight, once he closed down the business? Did I have friends who would put me\r\nup, people he had not heard about?\r\nHe knew the answers to all those questions, of course. He knew what I had to\r\ndo. And so did I.\r\nAt dawn, I rose and packed my few possessions into a gunny sack, slung it over\r\nmy right shoulder and took up my rifle, and said goodbye to Father. He placed\r\naround my neck a purse on a cord with fourteen dollars and some coppers inside\r\nto give over to Mary and to pay for supplies he had ordered in Westpott for the\r\nfarm, which I was to arrange to have transported on to North Elba when I got\r\nthere. As always, he filled my head with last-minute instructions.",
    " Which of the\r\nmerinos to breed this spring, which to sell, which to butcher for mutton; how\r\nmuch seed to set aside for a second planting if the first got hit by a late frost;\r\nwhich part of the acreage to clear next and which to leave for a woodlot; how\r\nmuch to pay in Westport for salt and flour, and who among the Negroes of\r\nTimbuctoo to hire and whether to pay them in goods or cash or crop shares.\r\n“Make work for them, if you can afford it, especially when the winter comes on.\r\nEven if you and Lyman and the boys are able to clear and cut on your own. They\r\nlearn from your example, and it brings them a small cash payment as well,\r\nwhich they will surely need.\r\n“Ah, Owen!” he declared. “I envy you, my boy. How I would love to be there\r\nnow, clearing that mountain forest, working with my back and arms all day and\r\ngathering together with my precious family around the table at night,” he said,\r\nsmiling and inhaling deeply, as if he could smell the crisp, cold Adirondack air.\r\n“That’s all the good Lord meant for a man to do. That, and to care for his\r\nneighbors. And you can do all of it up there. All of it. I envy you, son.”\r\nI thanked him for it, still sullen and resentful, and we embraced, or, rather, he\r\nembraced me, and I strode away from him, crossing through town to the main\r\nroad north—headed home, for that is what it was now. There was no other place\r\nI could name as home than that tidy farmhouse on the edge of the wilderness. So\r\nthere I went. Home.\r\nI had five days of walking ahead of me. A few times I accepted a farmer’s offer to\r\nput up in his barn, but otherwise I slept outdoors in a makeshift camp close to\r\nthe road, huddled in my blanket before a small fire, like a tramp.",
    " I walked\r\nsteadily from first light to last, up the long Connecticut Valley and across the\r\nGreen Mountains of Vermont, then north again along the western shore of Lake\r\nGeorge, past the ruins of old Ticonderoga to the glittering waters of Lake\r\nChamplain. There I stopped in Westport briefly on Father’s business, and then\r\nheaded upland into the Adirondacks. And the entire time, all five days and\r\nnights, I filled my mind with the conscious pretense that I was completely turned\r\naround, that my compass had reversed itself and I was walking south instead of\r\nnorth. I was moving down along the Subterranean Passway into Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina. I was marching towards the slaves and their masters. The\r\nfugitive slaves followed their north star; I followed its southern twin.\r\nIt was like a dream, a beautiful, soothing dream of late autumn: low, gray\r\nskies, smell of woodsmoke, fallen leaves crackling beneath my feet, and\r\nsomewhere out there, in the farmsteads and plantations ahead of me, swift\r\nretribution! Freedom! The bloody work of the Lord!\r\nChapter 14\r\nI arrived home in North Elba late in the afternoon just as it was growing dark,\r\ngreeted by my brother Watson a half-mile east of the farm, out where the road\r\nfrom Keene crests the long rise through the notch. I saw him from a distance and\r\ndid not at first recognize him. He was tall and lanky, all sticks and rope. He had\r\nturned onto the road, emerging from the woods there, leading the Morgan\r\nnamed Adelphi, hitched to a sledgeload of logs taken evidently from the back lot\r\nof the property, a forest of blue spruce that sloped towards Pitch-off Mountain.\r\nWatson saw me and waved. Though he was barely sixteen then, he had added\r\nconsiderably to his height since I’d last seen him and walked like a grown man\r\nwho’d done a hard day’s work.",
    " In the months since my departure, Watson had\r\nmanaged to slip away from most of his boyhood, and when I drew near, I saw\r\nthat his long, narrow face had the beginning haze of a reddish beard. It cheered\r\nme to see him so grown up. Nearly my height, he was well on his way to being\r\ntaller than I, who up to now had been the tallest in the family.\r\nFor a few seconds, we grinned at one another with slight self-consciousness,\r\nand then I embraced him warmly and tugged his new whiskers. “What’s this,\r\nWat?” I laughed. “Growing yourself a beard, eh?”\r\nHe grabbed my beard and gave it an answering yank. “Everybody always says\r\nyou’re the handsome one. I thought I’d give it a try, see if it’s the beard. It’s just\r\ngreat to see you, Owen!” he exclaimed, and threw his ropey arm over my\r\nshoulder. He cocked his head and studied me and said that I looked different to\r\nhim, that I’d changed somehow.\r\n“Come on, I’ve not been gone that long.”\r\n“No, seriously, Owen. You’re looking different. You didn’t fall in love or\r\nsomething, now, did you?” he said, and shook my shoulder and grinned.\r\nI confessed that it did feel weird to me, coming home this time, as if I had\r\nbeen away for years. My mind filled for an instant with the face of Sarah\r\nPeabody, but I swiftly put the image away, replacing her, as if for Watson’s sake,\r\nwith the sights and sounds of Liverpool, London, Waterloo.\r\n“You’re a famous world traveler now!” he said. “I want to hear about every\r\nsingle thing that you and the Old Man saw over there.”\r\nWe walked along beside the horse and sledge, the broad valley opening out in\r\nfront of us, with white-topped Tahawus and Mclntyre in the distance and the\r\nburnished range beyond, and although it was a gray, overcast day threatening to\r\nsnow, I saw again how lovely this place was. Of course, Father loved it here.\r\nHow could he not?",
    " And how could he not have envied me for being free to\r\nreturn here? I thought, and regretted for a moment that I had been so\r\ndisgruntled with him.\r\nI was expected, Watson then told me. But expected sooner than this, he said,\r\nas they had received a letter from Father some days earlier, telling them I was on\r\nmy way north. “Me and the boys thought you might’ve got distracted some over\r\nin Westport.”\r\nThis surprised me. “When was his letter dated?”\r\nHe didn’t know. The thirteenth, he thought. Yes, the thirteenth. “I copied it”\r\nhe said proudly. “Like you used to.”\r\nHow could that be? Two days prior to my signing the pledge with the\r\nGileadites, Father had written to the family that I would soon be coming home? I\r\ngrew angry again and freshly confused. He had already decided and had known,\r\neven as he was working up my spirits, that we would not fight alongside the\r\nNegroes of Springfield! He knew all along that I would be sent to North Elba.\r\nAnd had said nothing of it until afterwards, when he feebly claimed unexpected\r\nlegal troubles.\r\nWhat purpose could he have had—for the meetings, the sermonizing, the\r\npledge? And appointing me secretary and treasurer—why? Was it all for show?\r\nAnd for whom? Not me, certainly. For the Negroes? Had he merely been putting\r\non a play for the blacks of Springfield, working them up, organizing them for\r\nbattle and steeling them to pledge and risk their lives, when he had no real\r\nintention of joining them himself, or even of allowing his son to join them?\r\nI cursed aloud: “Damn him!”\r\n“What’s wrong?” Watson asked.\r\n“Nothing,” I said. “No, the Old Man, actually. It’s just that he knew I was\r\ncoming back here long before he told me. Even you knew before I did.”\r\nHe laughed and punched me on the shoulder. “Ah, well, Owen, that’s the Old\r\nMan, isn’t it? You can forget about him now, though. He’s there, and we’re here.",
    "\r\nYou’ve just been spending too much time with him and not enough with us.\r\nC’mon, Mother’s going to be happy to see you,” he declared. “And Ruth, too.\r\nEverybody!”\r\n“Lyman, too?”\r\n“Sure. Lyman, too,” he said. “It’s great you’re home, though. Tell me\r\neverything. I want to hear everything. Especially about old John Bull. I want to\r\nhear all about England. And Flanders! What’s that like?”\r\nAs we walked, I related some of the details of my journey, pleasing and\r\nexciting him to a surprising degree, as if I had been to the South Seas on a\r\nwhaling ship. Down the long hill we went, and soon, although it was not yet four\r\no’clock in the afternoon, we were walking in wintry darkness, as if dead of night\r\nhad fallen. Then, in the distance, I saw the glimmer of lamplight from the\r\nkitchen, and I made out the shape of the house. In this wide, dark, cold valley\r\nwith the blackened mountains beyond, the house looked like a small ship\r\nbobbing at anchor in a safe harbor.\r\n“You go in,” Watson said. “I’ll take care of Adelphi. We can unload these trees\r\ntomorrow in a twink.”\r\nI said fine and headed for the door, anxious suddenly and a little afraid, as if I\r\nwere about to hear unwanted news.\r\nBut, no, everything was joy and thanksgiving, kisses and embraces and bright,\r\nshining faces. They all gathered around me, as if I were one of Ulysses’ returning\r\nwarriors, gone for long years instead of months, and put their faces next to mine\r\nand kept touching me with their hands even after we had hugged one another.\r\nMy face nearly hurt from the smiling. They pulled my coat off me and bade me\r\nsit at the table, while the babies, Annie and Sarah, who, at seven and four years\r\nold, were no longer babies, unlaced and playfully drew off my boots.\r\nMary, sweetly calm in the center of the sun-shower, blessed me and thanked\r\nthe Lord for my safe return.",
    " She looked healthier than when I had left, her round\r\nface reddened from the heat of the kitchen stove and the excitement, and I\r\nglimpsed her prettiness, saw her for a second as she must have looked to Father\r\nwhen he first met her some eighteen years earlier, a warm, soft, utterly\r\nbenevolent presence in his unyielding, masculine world.\r\nI held her hands in mine and said, “I’m truly glad to see you, Mary. Are you as\r\nwell as you look?”\r\n“Oh, my, yes!” she said, and laughed, and Ruth and the boys, Oliver and\r\nSalmon, laughed, too.\r\n“What’s the joke?”\r\n“Oh, we’ll tell you later,” Ruth said, and ruffled my hair with her cool hand.\r\n“We’ve lots to tell. You and Father may not know it, Owen, but believe it or not,\r\nlife goes on without you.”\r\n“Apparently!’ I said, and looked around the crowded room. There were Oliver\r\nand Salmon, lithe, tanned boys grinning like monkeys, and the little girls, Sarah\r\nand Annie, already back at work, the one churning and the other putting out\r\nplates. And then for the first time I saw Susan Epps, standing beside the stove in\r\nthe further corner of the kitchen. Her hands were folded in her apron, and she\r\nwas smiling gently at me, as if waiting for me to acknowledge her before she\r\ncould greet me. At once I got up and crossed down the room to her and gave her\r\na friendly embrace, realizing as I did so that she was pregnant, and well along\r\nwith it, too.\r\n“Yes, indeed,” I said to her. “Life does go on!” and she gave a winning, shy\r\nlaugh. I congratulated her and turned to look for Lyman. “Where’s your excellent\r\nhusband?”\r\nThere was a silence, and then Watson, who had come in from the barn and\r\nwas shucking his coat by the door, said, “He’ll be back soon.”\r\n“Soon?”\r\n“Tonight. Or tomorrow night. He’s moving a few folks north.”\r\n“Well, good!’ I said. “I was kind of afraid that the whole operation’d come to a\r\nhalt.",
    " You know, after the business with Mister Fleete and our jailbreak.”\r\nIn a low voice, Mary said, “It did stop things, Owen. At least amongst the\r\nwhites.”\r\n“I’d expect some to cut and run.”\r\n“No, just about all have abandoned us.”\r\n“The Thompsons?” I asked.\r\n“Yes!’ Mary said. “Pretty much.”\r\n“The cowards!” I said, and slapped the table with my hand.\r\n“Not Henry, though,” Ruth piped. “He’s not abandoned us.” I looked over and\r\nremembered the exchange that I had seen between her and young Henry\r\nThompson at church.\r\n“Yeah, but Owen’s right,” Watson said. “The rest are cowards. It’s mostly just\r\nLyman alone making all the runs now. I’d be there beside him, if the Old Man’d\r\nlet me. It’s this Fugitive Law; it’s made cowards of our neighbors. People go over\r\nand harass the folks at Timbuctoo all the time, making like they’re looking for\r\nescaped slaves. Even some folks we once counted as abolitionists.”\r\nI asked Susan, “Is this true?”\r\n“Yes, mostly. But Lyman, him and a few others from there, are still taking\r\npeople north. It worries me. But people get this close to freedom, you got to help\r\nthem.”\r\nWe talked then for a while of the increased difficulties and dangers of\r\nharboring escaped slaves and transporting them from Timbuctoo to Canada.\r\nLyman had evidently grown fierce in the work, enraged by the death of Elden\r\nFleete and his own brief imprisonment and made reckless rather than timid by it,\r\njoined only by a few of the more adventurous Negroes and by Henry Thompson,\r\nwith no help coming from any of the whites in the northcountry, not even the\r\nQuakers in Port Kent. There were marshals and slave-catchers all over now,\r\nstopping off at the farm every few days and like plantation overseers checking\r\nthe shacks and huts of Timbuctoo, intimidating the whites generally and the\r\nNegroes pointedly and employing Partridge and others like him to spy for them.",
    "\r\nShortly, we were enjoying a fine, ample supper of Brunswick stew made with\r\nsquirrels shot that morning by Salmon and Oliver, and pickled beets and\r\ncucumbers, and a pile of Mary’s famous Indian hoecakes—my welcome-home\r\nsupper, Ruth called it. There was abundant good news, beyond Susan’s\r\npregnancy. Yes, it was true, Ruth and Henry Thompson had been courting, and\r\nas soon as he could arrange an interview with Father, Henry intended to ask for\r\nher hand in marriage. And the big, grinning secret concerning Mary was that\r\nshe, too, was pregnant.\r\nStartled, I put down my spoon and asked, “Well! That’s something, isn’t it?\r\nDoes Father know yet?”\r\n“Why, Owen, of course he does! I wrote to him right away. As soon as I knew\r\nmyself, I told him. He was pleased as pie. Didn’t he tell you?”\r\nI said no, he didn’t. “That is wonderful news, though,” said I, weakly, thinking\r\nmore of the difficulties promised by another child than the blessings. But now I\r\nunderstood why the Old Man had felt suddenly required to concentrate solely on\r\nwork which would help support the family, and why he had put the Gileadites so\r\nabruptly aside, and why he had sent me back here. With his wife pregnant again,\r\nhis sense of responsibility to his family would have been unexpectedly\r\nsharpened. He had not told me, no doubt, because it was still very early in her\r\npregnancy, and after so many lost babies, Father had learned to protect himself\r\nby holding his excitement in abeyance: it had become characteristic of him to\r\nwait practically until the pregnancy was over before beginning to speak of it.\r\nAlso, although he was a man who had helped a thousand sheep and hundreds of\r\ncows and horses to foal and had even helped deliver several of his own children,\r\nhe was nonetheless peculiarly shy about talking of such matters when it came to\r\nhumans.",
    "\r\nI felt kindly towards Father again, and guilty for having been so quick to judge\r\nhim. I upbraided myself and began to wonder whether I held some kind of\r\npermanent, unknown grudge against the man that kept me looking constantly\r\nfor reasons to indict him, even while I went on believing that I loved and\r\nadmired him beyond all other human beings. It was a strange, new question, and\r\ngave me pause.\r\nThe evening wore on, and as we talked and joked around the table and in the\r\nparlor afterwards, re-establishing our old, familiar roles and routines with one\r\nanother, I was more or less forcibly integrated into the family, and gradually I\r\nbegan to understand some of the more subtle changes that had recently taken\r\nplace at the farm, and mostly they disturbed me. The winter snows were about\r\nto blow down on us. But coming in, I’d noticed that a great deal of the autumn\r\nwork on the place had not been done. The livestock had looked well-cared-for,\r\nbut that, from long habit, was routine and to be expected. The boys had done a\r\nlot of hunting and fishing, I saw, with plenty of hides and pelts being dried in\r\nthe barn—bear, wolf, the usual deer and beaver, a wildcat, even a pair of\r\nmountain lions—and an abundance of salted venison and trout and corned beef\r\nhad been put up, but by the women, I assumed. Not half the wood in, and\r\nLyman and the boys had cleared and burned less than five hundred square rods\r\nof the flatland that wed need for spring planting and next year’s hay. Blacksmith\r\nshop and butchering shed not closed in. Cold cellar not dug, and the soil already\r\nfreezing hard. Barely half the fencing for the winter sheepfolds built. The barn\r\nhad been closed in properly, but there were chicken coops and an extension for a\r\nwinter pigsty that hadn’t been started.",
    " They’d bred the dams for early lambing,\r\nWatson assured me, and had tanned the hides of eight deer, but hadn’t gotten\r\naround yet to tanning the fleeces and pelts that Father had asked them to\r\nprepare for winter clothing. Fortunately, the women seemed to have done their\r\nautumn work—the smoking and salting of meats, putting up cheeses and lard,\r\nfilling the root cellar with potatoes, squashes, and turnips—so we would at least\r\nhave enough to eat.\r\nBut as I listened to the boys’ excuses and explanations, mostly made by\r\nWatson, who as the eldest felt obliged to speak for them, I began to see that their\r\nfailures had more to do with Lyman’s continued and protracted absences from\r\nthe farm, evidently caused by his work with the Underground Railroad, than by\r\nidleness or distraction on their part. They were, after all, only boys. Even\r\nWatson. They did not blame Lyman directly, but I saw that they wanted a proper\r\nforeman to organize the work every day and to provide instruction, oversight,\r\nand encouragement, and they needed a grown maris strong back to lift and heft\r\nalongside theirs.\r\nLyman’s Railroad work had to be done, too, of course. Who could reproach\r\nhim for it? Certainly not I, and in fact I intended to join him myself in his\r\nnighttime runs as soon as possible. But the farm had been allowed to slide. And\r\nunless we quickly pulled it back in line, we’d soon freeze, or our livestock would,\r\nand we’d starve, or we’d have to abandon the place altogether—and then no one\r\nwould be able to work the Railroad.\r\nI detected some small resentments against Lyman by the boys, evidenced by\r\ntheir clear reluctance to praise him or even to talk much about him, as if the\r\nsubject held little or no interest for them.",
    " Mary and Ruth were voluble enough\r\nconcerning the man, but I felt that they were not so much praising him as\r\ndemonstrating to Susan their love and support of her, protecting her from\r\nembarrassment, and even at that, it was faint praise they were offering, more\r\noften excuses and explanations for his inability to run the place properly than\r\nproud descriptions of some specific accomplishment.\r\nAlso, without Father to generate and sustain the contacts with Timbuctoo, the\r\nfamily appeared to have fallen away from the Negro community without having\r\nbuilt any compensatory alliances with the whites, except for Ruth’s connection\r\nto the Thompsons, by virtue of her relationship with Henry. This was distressing.\r\nIn this tough place, we all needed each other, white and Negro alike. But after\r\nthe death of Elden Fleete, and with Father’s and my departure following hard\r\nupon, the Negroes had been a little tetchy, Watson said. Understandably so. And\r\nthere being no one left at the farm who could reassure them of our faithfulness\r\nto their cause, they had withdrawn almost all contact, despite Lyman’s and\r\nSusan’s continued loyalty to the family.\r\nThe Negroes were in bad shape, Watson said, and Susan confirmed: harried by\r\nthe local whites, fearful of being carried off by slave-catchers and marshals, and\r\nnot at all prepared for winter. Also, Watson explained, there was a growing\r\nnumber of whites, led by our old friend Mr. Partridge of Keene, who wished that\r\nboth the Browns and the citizens of Timbuctoo would go back to wherever they\r\ncame from. Some of these whites had previously been supporters of Father’s\r\nefforts to help the Negroes, but now they, too, coveted the Negroes’ and our land\r\nout on the flats—rich, silted land, rare in the Adirondacks, which they could see\r\nwas not being farmed properly.",
    " By their lights, we were misusing it, wasting our\r\ngood fortune, and this angered them, for they were New England-style farmers,\r\nthe type that likes to regard waste as a sin. Mr. Partridge, himself no great\r\nshakes as a farmer, was exploiting these resentments for his own purposes,\r\nwhich Watson said surely included gaining revenge for our having invaded his\r\nhome in August, when we shot the slave-catcher and then freed Lyman and Mr.\r\nFleete from the Elizabethtown jail.\r\nNow, suddenly, where before I had thought of that episode with something\r\napproaching shame, I found myself regarding it almost with nostalgia, and I\r\nwished that we had done more damage than we did, wished that we had actually\r\nslain the slave-catcher and maybe Mr. Partridge, too, and wished that I had been\r\nthe one to pull the trigger. There were tensions and conflicts everywhere\r\nbreaking out, and I could not see how they could be quickly resolved, least of all\r\nby me. I could not step forward in church like Father and preach the Lord’s work\r\nto the whites one week and then preach it to the Negroes the next, or walk into\r\nthe midst of a crowd of white men at a cattle auction and scold them for their\r\nsloth and cowardice as only the Old Man could scold, and then ride over to\r\nTimbuctoo and do the same to a crowd of glowering, suspicious ex-slaves.\r\nEven so, while there was little or nothing I could do to improve relations with\r\nthe local people, white or black, I could nonetheless pull things together here on\r\nthe farm. Eager to get an early start, and not a little tired from my journey, I\r\nbegged off Watson’s and Ruth’s entreaties to tell them still more of the story of\r\nFather’s and my travels abroad and climbed up to the loft well before the others.",
    "\r\nLying in my cot there in the darkened chamber, I listened to the murmur of the\r\nvoices of my family below: Mary and Ruth were carding wool and spinning, and\r\nthe boys were coming and going between the house and barn, bedding down the\r\nanimals, bringing in firewood, the last household chores of the day, while the\r\nlittle girls and Susan took turns reading from the primer, teaching one another to\r\nread and now and again appealing to Ruth or Mary to settle a dispute over a\r\nword’s meaning or spelling. With those sweet sounds filling my ears, I drifted\r\ninto peaceful sleep.\r\nA while later, when the others came up to bed, I woke and listened in the\r\ndarkness as, one by one, they, too, fell into slumber. But this time, however, I\r\nmyself could not fall back to sleep. I lay wide-eyed in the silent darkness of the\r\nroom for hours, my mind a-buzz with half-completed thoughts startling and\r\ninterrupting one another. I could not figure what was keeping me so agitated—I\r\nalmost never had any difficulty sleeping. Quite the opposite. Hours slipped by,\r\nand then I lost all track of how long I had been awake, and not until the first\r\nbleeding away of darkness signaled the near approach of dawn did I suddenly\r\nrealize that I was waiting for Lyman to come home. And when I knew that, I\r\nthought only of it, and him. Until pale daylight began to filter into the room,\r\nwhen I rose and dressed and directly set about putting things right: like Father,\r\nthe first one up and working.\r\nI remember thinking on that first frosty morning home, as I walked the grounds\r\nand examined the outbuildings and livestock, that it would be a simple matter to\r\nmake up for Father’s and my lengthy absence and set the place straight. And, in\r\na sense, it was simple, but not the way I expected.",
    " I calculated thirty days of\r\nsteady work for the five of us—three boys, Watson, Salmon, and Oliver, and two\r\ngrown men, Lyman Epps and me. I had learned early in life from Father how to\r\norganize a crew and lay out the day’s work before breakfast, how to see each job\r\nthrough to the end before commencing another, how to make sure that each of\r\nus knew exactly what was expected of him for the entire day, and so on.\r\nFather had never been easy with distributing authority of any kind anyhow,\r\nand he had failed to do it here also. Although, as usual, he had included in his\r\nletters long lists of things to do and when and how, he had simply left taking\r\ncare of the farm to his family members and Lyman and Susan in a general way,\r\nwithout explicitly stating who was in charge of what and whom—so, in a way, it\r\nwas more the Old Man’s fault than anyone else’s that the place had come\r\nundone. No family members were lazy or incapable. They had just needed a\r\ncaptain, or in this case, due to the captain’s absence, a first mate. Without one,\r\nthey had been working at sixes and sevens, each person responding only to his\r\nor her immediate needs, laboring more against each other than with each other,\r\nwith no long view of things, no plan. Every man or boy for himself.\r\nI will set everything right with ease, said I to myself. I had finished my\r\ninspection of the place with a circuit of the barn and a stop at the privy, where I\r\nnoted the need to remove the season’s night soil, and was about to return to the\r\nhouse and lay the kitchen fire for Mary before any of the others were out of bed.\r\nBetween Mounts Tahawus and Mclntyre the sun had already broken the horizon,\r\nand rosy streaks of new light spilled across the rippled, silvery sky.",
    " Over towards\r\nthe village, the clouds were opening up, and in the dark blue western sky the\r\nmorning star and a crescent moon were slipping towards the horizon. I stopped\r\nand took it in. It was dawn—first light, a marvelous, cold, half-illumined stillness\r\n—and made a comforting, reflective pause between night and day, between\r\nautumn and winter.\r\nI could make out the village from the belfry of the church and a few threads of\r\nchimney-smoke rising from a black line of spruce trees by the river. There was a\r\nglaze of frost on the distant, yellowed fields and on the leafless branches and\r\nstalks of the chokecherry and alder bushes along the road from town and on the\r\nroofs of the house and barn and the unfinished outbuildings—a pale caul or a\r\nshroud, I could not say which, but it made everything look fresh and clean. I\r\ngazed around me and inhaled the cold mountain air with pleasure, the first pure\r\npleasure I had felt in many days, since the night of the formation of the\r\nGileadites.\r\nMy anger was gone. Soon everyone would admire me and be glad that I had\r\ncome back.\r\nAs I neared the house to go in, I heard from the direction of the village the\r\nrumble of wagon wheels on the frozen road and the clop of a slow-moving horse.\r\nAround the curve in the road there came the second Morgan, Poke, the mare,\r\npulling our old wagon at a plodding pace, and up on the box sat Lyman Epps,\r\nevidently asleep. Until the horse, smelling the barn, I suppose, accelerated\r\nsomewhat and jolted him awake.\r\nFrom the doorstoop, I watched him for a moment, without his having yet\r\nnoticed me.",
    " He was exhausted, slump-shouldered, and barely able to hold his\r\nhead up; his skin color was flat gray, like pewter, and his hair stuck out from\r\nunder his cap in short, knotty clumps, and he seemed older, almost middle-aged:\r\nhe looked more like an escaped slave himself, a man on the run, than a\r\nconductor on the Underground Railroad. How dangerously thin, especially now,\r\nI thought, was the line between an escaped slave and a freed slave, between the\r\nNegro man who was chattel and the one who was free. And how wide the gulf\r\nthat lay between a Negro man, slave or free, and me.\r\nHe put up the wagon and unhitched Poke and led her into the barn to water\r\nand feed her and brush her down, still without having seen me. I was oddly\r\nhesitant about following him and speaking with him; yet we had much to say to\r\none another. I felt shy as a girl with him, anxious and worried, even worried\r\nabout my appearance’.\r\nSuddenly angry with myself, I strode across the yard to the barn determined to\r\nerase my self-consciousness and went in and greeted Lyman with false\r\nheartiness. “Hello, friend!” I loudly exclaimed. “Are you working late, or starting\r\nthe day early?”\r\nHe smiled wanly and shook my hand. “Good to see you, Owen. When did you\r\narrive?”\r\nI told him of my return the previous day and jabbered on about my journey\r\nfrom Springfield. While I yacked and he listened, I helped him settle the horse\r\nand hang the harness, until finally I realized that he was standing at the barn\r\ndoor, politely waiting for me to finish so he could go into the house.\r\n“I’m sorry!” I said. “Here I’m keeping you from your wife. And you must be\r\nhungry and want to wash, while I’m going on about nothing.”\r\n“No, no, that’s all right. I just needs to sleep some,” he said, and yawned.\r\n“Pulled me a long ride last night, all the way back from Massena on them\r\ncorduroy roads, you know. My backbone’s sore.",
    "”\r\n“How many’d you take up?”\r\n“A pair of ‘em. Two men. From near Norfolk originally, off a Chesapeake Bay\r\nplantation. One a preacher. Preached my ear off the whole way up.”\r\n“You get them over all right? No trouble?”\r\n“No trouble. No help, neither, but no trouble.”\r\n“Well, you’ll have some help now,”I said, adding that as soon as we had the\r\nfarm readied for winter, I’d be working the Railroad with him. “That ought to\r\nshame a few other white folks back into action,” I declared.\r\n“I don’t know, folks is pretty scared now!’ he said. “But good. I could use some\r\nhelp moving those as comes along from time to time. There ain’t as many as\r\nbefore, you know. Not since the Fugitive Law.”\r\n“The Fugitive Law!” I said, and spat, like an actor in a melodramatic show.\r\n“But I expect with winter coming,” he went on, “we’ll see a last batch making\r\na run for it. So’s they don’t get stuck hiding out in people’s attics down here till\r\nspring.”\r\n“Right, right, of course. But first we’ve got to—”\r\n“In fact,” he said, interrupting me, “Tom Grey over to Timbuctoo, you recall\r\nhim? He told me of a family of five, maybe six, be coming through from Utica\r\ntonight or tomorrow. If they ain’t already arrived. You didn’t hear nothing ’bout\r\nthat, did you? Tom said he’d send word over here soon’s they arrived.”\r\n“No. No one told me anything. But first we’ve got to get this place in shape,\r\nLyman.”\r\n“Yes. Yes, I know,” he said, and turned to leave.\r\nI reached out and grabbed him by the arm, more forcefully than I intended,\r\ncausing him to stop and remove my hand as if insulted by it.\r\n“I’m sorry;’ I said. “It’s just I need to talk to you about the work, Lyman. Fact\r\nis, you and the boys have let things slide a little far, I think.”\r\nHe turned to me, with his face cast to the side.",
    " I began nonetheless to list the\r\nvarious jobs and projects that lay before us and to put them in the order that we\r\nwould follow, when I shortly realized that he wasn’t hearing me, was merely\r\nwaiting for me to finish so he could go inside the house. I grew impatient with\r\nhim. In a sense, this was his farm, too, nearly as much as it was mine, and he\r\nhad certain responsibilities towards it, which he clearly was not interested in\r\naccepting. “Lyman, you’re not listening, are you?”\r\n“Owen” he said, still without looking at me, “what I am is tired. My back feels\r\nbroke from three days and nights up on that wagon out there. Maybe we can talk\r\nabout these matters later, when I’ve got me some rest.”\r\nI don’t know what came over me then, but my ears began to buzz, and a\r\ngauzy, blood-red screen dropped before my eyes. With no conscious intention or\r\ndesire to do it, I grabbed Lyman by the shoulder with my right hand, clamped\r\nmy left onto his belt, and lifted and flung him bodily across the room, banging\r\nhim hard against the stall, causing the horses to roll their eyes in fear and stamp\r\ntheir feet. He slid to the floor, shaken and astonished, and looked up at me with\r\nfear in his eyes for the first time ever, which I took in happily almost, accepting\r\nhis gaze with a strange relief. As if I had long wanted him to fear me.\r\nHe said in a steady, low voice, “There’s something gone wrong in you.”\r\nMy breathing came hard, although I had not exerted myself—I was very\r\nstrong, and Lyman, not a large man, had not resisted me. “Maybe... maybe there\r\nis. No, nothing is wrong in me. But my priorities... I have to hold to my\r\npriorities. This farm, it’s all so shaky. The winter’s coming. You wouldn’t listen.”\r\nSlowly, he got to his feet and brushed bits of hay off his coat and trousers and\r\nput his cap back on, restoring his dignity. “I’m listening now,” was all he said.",
    "\r\n“Well, we’ve got these priorities. The farm and all. And responsibilities, to the\r\nfamily. To your family, too. You and I, we’ve got to take care of them in the\r\nproper way. Then we can attend to the others, to the Railroad and all that. But\r\nit’s not like we have Father here for that. Don’t you understand?”\r\n“I understand. Priorities. Responsibilities. I understand those things just fine.”\r\nHe moved warily towards the open barn door, facing me all the while, as if he\r\nexpected me to attack him again. And I was gladdened by his wariness. I knew\r\nthat in an hour, perhaps in a moment or two, I would surely collapse inside\r\nmyself with shame and would beg Lyman’s forgiveness; but right then I was\r\ndetermined to keep myself open to these feelings of unexpected joy and to let\r\nthem flow through me like a cold wind. By attacking Lyman physically, I had\r\nreleased in myself something dark and wonderfully satisfying. It was as if an ice-\r\ndam had let go, and huge chunks of ice, a flotilla of logs and fallen trees and\r\nfrozen debris, were cascading over boulders and cliffs, making a great roar, and I\r\nwas at this instant thrilled by the sheer power and noise of the flow.\r\nI had done the forbidden thing. I had struck a black man.\r\nI took a step towards him, and he jumped back, nearly out the door of the barn\r\ninto the yard.\r\nI reached for him, and he jumped again. “Why didn’t you fight me, Lyman?”\r\nHe squinted up at me as if he had not heard right.\r\n“I want to know. Why didn’t you fight me, just now?”\r\n“You think I’m a fool?”\r\n“Is it because I’m white?”\r\nHe laughed coldly. “No, Owen, it ain’t because you’re white. I ain’t afraid of\r\nyour skin. I might be afraid of what you got inside your head, though. And I\r\ntreat any man twice my size with a certain caution. That’s all.”\r\n“Well, it’s over,” I said.",
    " I couldn’t apologize, not yet, but I said, “I swear, 111\r\nnever do that again.”\r\nHe hesitated a moment and stared at me, and I saw that the fear had\r\ndissipated somewhat, replaced by something harder, darker. “Maybe so. Maybe\r\nnot. Time will tell that.” He looked more sad than anything else. He said, “You\r\ntell me something, though.”\r\n“What?”\r\n“When you grab onto me like that and toss me down, you doing it because you\r\ncan. Is that because I’m a whole lot smaller than you? Or is it because I’m\r\ncolored?”\r\nI was silent for a few seconds but did not look away. “You know the answer to\r\nthat.”\r\n“Say it, then.”\r\n“It’s not because you’re smaller than me.”\r\n“Right. It’s my skin. You’re afraid of my skin. But I ain’t afraid of yours. Which\r\nis why I didn’t fight you back. That’s what we got here. Ain’t it?”\r\n“I can’t lie to you.”\r\n“‘Appreciate that,” he said. “I’m going in now. We can discuss all those\r\npriorities and responsibilities of yours later on, if you want. But I got some of my\r\nown need tending first.” He turned, straightened, and walked towards the house\r\nand went quickly inside.\r\nI saw smoke curling from the chimney; Mary had set the fire, and I could see\r\nher through the window at the stove, smiling broadly at Lyman as he entered,\r\nand Susan crossing the room towards him with her arms out. The others were\r\nprobably already up and about, too, and were greeting him, welcoming him\r\nhome, relieved that he had gotten back from the border safe and unharmed. And\r\nI saw that I, who was going to lead them, would now have to follow.\r\nWe remained friends, Lyman and I, but only of a sort, for there was now\r\nbetween us a nearly tangible distance, as if we were condemned to carry a long\r\nstick together, which connected us one to the other and at the same time kept us\r\nstrictly apart.",
    " Each man was at all times painfully conscious of the other’s\r\npresence and, when it occurred, his absence as well. A difficult intimacy; but it\r\nwas all we had now.\r\nI made no further argument against his priorities or for mine, and whenever he\r\ntook the horse and wagon and was gone from the farm for two or three days at a\r\ntime, I barely acknowledged to him that I had noticed. When he returned and\r\nhad rested, he would come directly to me, say nothing about where he had been,\r\nand politely ask where did I want him to work that day. I assigned him to\r\nwhatever task was at hand, and he pitched himself whole-heartedly into it. But\r\nthen a few days or a week would pass, and word would come that he had\r\npassengers waiting over at Timbuctoo, and he’d be gone again.\r\nI forbade the boys to join him on these runs, causing at first some tension\r\nbetween me and Watson, particularly; he had grown stridently anti-slavery—as a\r\nway of asserting his new manhood, I supposed. But he was eventually mollified\r\nby my promise that, as soon as we had the place in shape for winter, he and I\r\nboth would join Lyman carrying slaves to freedom. We’d go back to “the work.”\r\nBy the time the snows were falling heavily and regularly and temperatures no\r\nlonger went above zero and the winds from Canada had begun their scraping\r\nhowl, there were no more escaped slaves coming our way, and we all, even\r\nLyman, from then till spring, spent our days and nights pretty much inside. By\r\nmid-December, however, before the heavy snows and cold hit, we had managed\r\nto cut and stack close to fifty cords of firewood, most of which, to Lyman’s and\r\nthe boys’ credit, came from hardwood trees that they had dropped and trimmed\r\nin the forest earlier in the autumn.",
    " We finished the cold cellar and the other\r\noutbuildings, fenced in the sheepfolds, bred the ewes, did all the fall butchering,\r\nran a short sawdust barrier around the base of the house, and completed half-a-\r\nhundred other chores and jobs—all of it done before winter finally descended\r\nwith its full strength.\r\nAfter that, Lyman withdrew and spent his days mostly in his blacksmith’s\r\nshop, manufacturing ironwork for the farm, everything from nails to fireplace\r\ndogs, and I worked alone, too, usually in the barn, where, among other useful\r\nthings, I built a set of sled runners and affixed them to the wagon in place of the\r\nwheels, making a sleigh of it, which enabled us to get quickly and comfortably\r\nto church on the Sabbath and into the settlement, where we milled our grain and\r\ncorn, sold fleeces, leather, and woolen cloth for a little cash money, and visited\r\nthe few families we still felt comfortable with, such as the Nashes, the Brewsters,\r\nand the Thompsons; with the latter, through the connection between their son\r\nHenry and sister Ruth, we were becoming nicely linked.\r\nI remember that winter, despite the tense stand-off between me and Lyman, as\r\nthe most peaceful of all our winters in North Elba. Perhaps it was because we\r\nwere free for once of “the work” and because Father was away. It put us more at\r\nease with our neighbors, certainly, for it made us more like them—abolitionist in\r\nprinciple but not in action; devoted to our farm and livestock, but not at the cost\r\nof not socializing with our neighbors; religious to the point of regularly\r\nattending services on the Sabbath and otherwise honoring the day as we always\r\nhad, but not preaching to everyone and thumping people with the Bible on every\r\npossible occasion.",
    "\r\nExcept for the fact that we had a Negro man and woman living with us in our\r\nhouse, we were no different from any other white family settled in that area.\r\nLike them, we holed up against the winter, did some hunting, ice-skated on\r\nMirror Lake, repaired and built tools and furniture, spun wool and wove cloth,\r\ntanned hides and made new boots, harness, hats, and belts, and tended our\r\nflocks and cattle and horses. We ate our stores of salt pork, mutton, venison, and\r\nsalt fish; we ate it roasted, boiled, baked, and in stews; with potatoes, squashes,\r\nbeets, beans, pumpkins, carrots, and turnips from the cold cellar. We drank\r\nplenty of fresh milk, made cheese and butter in abundance, mashed our apples\r\ninto cider, and warmed ourselves before the fire with sassafras tea. Like all good\r\nabolitionists, we eschewed sugar, but for sweets we had gallons of honey taken\r\nin the early autumn, and as we would not be able to tap our own trees till\r\nspring, we swapped hides with our neighbors for their extra maple syrup, using\r\nit to flavor meats, vegetables, and bread, and made maple sugar from it and\r\nsheets of hard maple candy. And we grew healthy and strong inside our warm\r\nhouse.\r\nWe said grace over every meal, prayed together in the evening, and sang the\r\nold hymns, and sometimes we even sang new songs, which we learned from our\r\nneighbors or from Susan or that Mary remembered from her childhood. We read\r\nThe Liberator and Frederick Douglass’s North Star and from Father’s collection of\r\nbooks, and we older folks taught the little ones their ABCs and numbers, while\r\nRuth worked with Susan and Lyman, teaching them with the primer to read\r\nadult books and periodicals.\r\nAnd we read Father’s letters. Every few weeks, a new, long letter arrived from\r\none of the stops in his odyssey through the courts, letters from Springfield, Troy,\r\nPittsburgh, Boston, and Hartford.",
    " Instructional and scolding, as always, but also\r\nwarm and affectionate, they were. As had been the practice for many years, we\r\nread them aloud, and then I or Watson copied the letters; we left the originals\r\nout on his desk, for further perusal and to keep track of his instructions, and\r\nplaced the copies in Father’s steel box, protecting them against flood, fire, or\r\ntheft. For posterity, as Father said, although up to that time preserving his letters\r\nhad seemed mere vanity to me—especially after the Gileadites and our\r\nadventures in England, which had left me feeling somewhat disillusioned\r\nregarding posterity’s interest in my father and his work.\r\nBut increasingly that winter, Father’s letters spoke in unusual detail of his\r\nmeetings with famous men and women, abolitionists all, some of them well-\r\nknown white ministers and teachers, like Reverends Channing and Parker and\r\nthe famous Horace Mann, some of them known as well for their support of\r\nfemale rights, like Dr. Howe and Miss Lydia Maria Child and Miss Abby Kelley,\r\nwho was one of the best orators he had ever heard, said Father. There were\r\nfamous Negroes, too: he met with Bishop Loguen in Syracuse and confided his\r\nplan, which, according to Father, “Bishop Loguen thinks noble and very possibly\r\nworkable.” At a meeting in Hartford, he heard Miss Harriet Tubman address a\r\nhundred white people very bravely. Personally introduced to her afterwards by\r\nFrederick Douglass, Father said he “spoke at considerable length with her and\r\nfound her a great warrior.",
    "” In Boston, he frequently found himself in the\r\ncompany of literary people and mentioned Thomas Wentworth Higginson and a\r\nyoung editor of The Atlantic Monthly, Franklin Sanborn, who took him to\r\nConcord to meet personally with Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom Father now\r\nadmired, and his friend Henry Thoreau, “a firebrand on the subject of slavery,”\r\nwrote Father, “but a strangely misanthropic fellow, due to his loss of religion, I\r\nbelieve. I know nothing of his writings, but Mr. Sanborn assures me they are\r\nvery good.” There were even some businessmen, he told us, who were becoming\r\ninterested in aiding the movement generally and Father in particular: a fellow in\r\nthe cloth-manufacturing business named George Stearns and “several rich men\r\nwho want their money to go for something more substantial than speeches and\r\nnewspapers and travel expenses for public speakers. I intend to satisfy them of\r\nthis,”he wrote.\r\nFor one as close to Father as I, it was difficult to see him as others did. But it\r\ncould not be denied that when he held forth on the subjects of slavery and\r\nreligion in a public forum, he had a commanding presence, despite his high-\r\npitched voice and stiff, somewhat Puritanical manner, and the more people\r\ndeferred to him, the more he seemed to warrant their deference, for the\r\nattention and respect of strangers made him appear to grow literally in size and\r\nstature, as well as in lucidity and brilliance of speech. And he was never so tall\r\nand straight, never so articulate and convincing in argument, never so\r\nunquestionably honest and sincere, as when holding forth on the inextricably\r\nentwined subjects of slavery and religion.",
    "\r\nIt was as if Father saw all Americans residing inside a cosmic allegory, like\r\ncharacters in a story by John Bunyan, and his personal force and intelligence\r\nwere such that he could make even the most materialistic of men believe it with\r\nhim. People had grown more desperate now, more pessimistic as to the\r\ninescapable, gradual ending of slavery in America, and many who in the past\r\nhad been content to oppose slavery merely with words were now beginning to\r\nconsider more drastic action. As one of the very few who had come forward with\r\na specific plan of action, and as perhaps the only man who seemed capable of\r\ncarrying it out, Father was therefore a considerably more interesting figure now\r\nthan he had been a mere six months earlier.\r\nAlso, it was of no small matter, I’m sure, that Father was unique among white\r\nabolitionists by virtue of his having captured the trust and admiration of\r\nNegroes, given him not because of his political power or wealth or social\r\nstanding, for he had none, but because of the pure force of his anger. What in\r\nFather frightened the whites pleased the blacks. Frederick Douglass, Bishop\r\nLoguen, Reverend Highland Garnet, Harriet Tubman—they all vouched for him,\r\nspoke of him as one of them, and this surely must have impressed the whites\r\nsufficiently to balance their fear of him.\r\nHe was, after all, quite unlike the rest of the better-known white abolitionists.\r\nFirst off, he was a physically tough man, and it showed. Although he had never\r\nfought in battle, he gave the impression of a man who had. Tanned and lean as a\r\nbraided leather quirt, straight as a stick, he had the physical energy of a man\r\nhalf his age. His spartan regimen of little sleep, basic food, no alcohol or\r\ntobacco, was impressive.",
    " Also, he spoke knowledgeably of weapons and of the\r\nacquisition and deployment of men, horses, and supplies; he understood\r\nprinciples of attack and siege, strategic retreat, counter-attack, and ambush; he\r\nhad studied the memoirs of great generals and the histories of famous campaigns\r\nwith sufficient diligence that he could sound like a man who had been at\r\nWaterloo with Napoleon himself, who had fought alongside Garibaldi, who had\r\nridden with Cortez against the invincible Montezuma.\r\nThe winter in North Elba, even by our old Ohio and New England standards, was\r\nlong and brutal. But our Adirondack neighbors deemed it mild, and despite our\r\nsecret suspicion that it would never end, spring did eventually come trickling in,\r\nand with it came the time for the birth of Susan’s and Lyman’s baby, an\r\nimminent arrival which was regarded by all of us as a great event. We had come\r\nto know in varying degrees how Susan had lost her previous children to slavery,\r\nand though he never spoke of it, we believed that Lyman was eager to become a\r\nfather. This would be his and Susan’s first child born in freedom, and its birth\r\nwould be a visible emblem of their great sacrifice and triumph.\r\nSusan had taken to sleeping downstairs with Mary, whose own baby was not\r\ndue till early June, the two pregnant women sharing Father’s and Mary’s large\r\nbed by the stove; Lyman, of course, had continued to sleep up in the loft with me\r\nand the boys on one side of the curtain, Ruth and the girls on the other. It was\r\nnot an uncomfortable arrangement, however unconventional, and it was\r\npractical, contriving as it did to make the hours we spent in bed a businesslike\r\naffair difficult to corrupt with indolence or socializing, for as soon as you woke,\r\nout of politeness and modesty, there was nothing to do but rise from your cot\r\nand dress in the dark and set about to work.",
    " Our sleeping arrangements, except\r\nwhen Father was at home, when they provided him and Mary with a small\r\nprivacy, functioned strictly to enable us to sleep, nothing else. Which was, no\r\ndoubt, as Father had intended.\r\nThe animals were restless, shedding their shaggy winter coats and eager to be\r\nlet out of their pens and stalls after long confinement, and the lambing had\r\nbegun in a promising way, and we were looking forward to a successful\r\nshearing. Also, we had two new calves and a large litter of pigs to add to our\r\nlivestock. The mountains were still as shrouded by snow and bleak sheets of ice\r\nas in January, but down in the cleared valleys and flatlands surrounding North\r\nElba, the snow had diminished to long, rounded peninsulas and smooth-shored\r\nislands melting into the yellowed, soppy fields and soft, two-feet-deep blankets\r\nthat lingered in the woods and dales and on north-facing slopes. The Au Sable\r\nRiver was running freely again, and the lakes and ponds, although they had not\r\nbegun yet to crack and boom and break up, were no longer safe to cross with a\r\nsleigh.\r\nSuddenly, we were once again busy outdoors, clearing new ground, burning\r\nstumps and building fences, preparing the land for plowing as soon as it dried,\r\ntapping sugar maples and boiling down the sap in huge cauldrons. With each\r\nnew day the sun rose earlier and set later, and every night we fell into bed\r\nexhausted from our work and rose in the morning eager to return to it. We had\r\nentered what our laconic neighbors called, not spring, but mud season. Where,\r\nfor months, the frozen, rock-hard roads, lanes, paths, and farmyards had been\r\nburied under head-high drifts, they were now cleared of snow and ice and stood\r\nrevealed as made entirely of soft, sticky mud—heavy, deep, corrugated rivers\r\nand ponds of it.",
    " The mud was everywhere, impossible to keep out of the house,\r\noff our tools and boots, wagons, animals, and machinery, and we slogged\r\nthrough it as if through molasses.\r\nI hung the sleigh runners in the barn and put onto the wagon a new set of\r\nlarge, wide wheels, which I had built myself during the dark winter months, six-\r\nfoot wheels with iron rims that had been crafted by Lyman in his smith’s shop. It\r\nwas hard going, but with the new wagon wheels and by using both horses\r\ninstead of only one, we were able to travel nonetheless. And travel we did. For\r\nthere was movement again on the Underground Railroad, and this time I meant\r\nto take Watson and join Lyman myself in conducting the fugitive slaves, who\r\nwere beginning to emerge blinking and fearful from their wintry hiding places\r\nand make their way north once again, passed as before from hand to hand, cellar\r\nto cellar, and attic to attic, up along the route from Utica to Timbuctoo to Port\r\nKent and on by cart or sleigh to French Canada; or sometimes, via Lyman’s\r\nfavorite route now, traveling northwest from Timbuctoo over the deepest\r\nAdirondack wilderness to Massena, thence to the St. Lawrence crossing at\r\nCornwall and into Ontario there.\r\nWe Browns were going to be alongside him this time, armed and vigilant. I\r\nwished to make it clear to Lyman that he and I now shared the same priorities. I\r\ncould not bear the thought that he might think me interested only in the farm, as\r\nhad undeniably been the case in the autumn. These fluctuations in policy, I\r\nknew, were a sign of my confusion then, but it felt not so much like a moral\r\nconfusion as a temporary and strictly personal conflict between loyalty to Lyman\r\nand loyalty to Father. With the autumn and winter behind us, I believed that I\r\nwas able once again to be loyal to both.",
    "\r\nSlave-catchers and their collaborators that spring were skulking like hungry\r\nwolves in and around all the towns and cities that lay along the usual routes\r\nnorth, especially in western New York and in the Hudson and Champlain valleys\r\nfrom Albany to Plattsburgh, and as a result, agents of the Underground Railroad\r\nin places like Utica, Syracuse, and Schenectady were sending many more\r\nfugitives than before over the considerably more arduous Adirondack mountain\r\nand wilderness route that Lyman favored. This in spite of the harsh weather, the\r\nbad roads, the long distances between stations, and the threat of meeting wolves\r\nand other wild animals. Along about the middle of March, fugitives first began\r\narriving late at night in Timbuctoo, and the next morning one of our few allies\r\nfrom the settlement, a person known to us, would arrive at the farm to apprise\r\nus of the situation. That same night, regardless of our obligations at the farm,\r\nLyman and I and Watson would hitch up the team and drive the wagon over to\r\nTimbuctoo, where we would pick up our poor, frightened human cargo and\r\ncarry it north to Canada and freedom.\r\nHappily, during this period Lyman and I came to be like brothers again. We\r\nrenewed our old joking manner with one another and even began having serious\r\ntalks on such subjects as religion and the relations between men and women. But\r\nnot race. Prior to our confrontation in the fall, race had been the central subject\r\nof all our serious talks with one another, and we rarely, if ever, discussed our\r\ntrue beliefs regarding religion or men and women. Now, however, race was the\r\nsole unspoken subject between us. We could talk truthfully and as equals about\r\nthe Lord, about His work, and about being men, like any two friends of the same\r\ncolor, but we could no longer talk about one of us being black and the other\r\nwhite.",
    " I secretly grieved over this particular loss of intimacy, for I had never\r\nshared it with a Negro man before. But at the same time I was glad of it, too.\r\nPerched up on the box alongside Lyman, with Watson crouched at the rear of the\r\nwagon with his rifle at the ready, our precious cargo huddled out of sight\r\nunderneath the tarpaulin, I felt somehow freed to pretend that Lyman, like me,\r\nwas a white man, or that I, like him, was black, and we were merely two\r\nAmerican men out doing the Lord’s work together.\r\nThere were fifteen or twenty runs that spring, but I remember best the morning\r\nin mid-April when we came back to the farm from an especially arduous run to\r\nthe Ontario border. We had been gone for three days and four nights, had almost\r\nlost the wagon in a muskeg south of Potsdam, had been forced to travel half a\r\nday off our route on an old lumbermen’s trail to find a place where we could\r\nsafely ford the Raquette River, and at the end had narrowly escaped a pair of\r\nslave-catchers encamped outside Massena, just south of the border. Watson had\r\nperformed bravely, and though he claimed to have shot both of them when they\r\npursued us in the gray, early morning light for several miles along the bank of\r\nthe broad, still-frozen St. Lawrence, he certainly hit one, which discouraged the\r\nother, and thus we were able finally to deliver our cargo safely at the crossing to\r\nCornwall.\r\nThe trip back to North Elba, though less risky—since now the only Negro\r\naboard was Lyman, who always carried his old, tattered manumission papers in\r\na wallet strapped to his leg like a knife—was not much easier, as the weather\r\nalternated between rain, sleet, and snow. We crossed marsh and muskeg, saw\r\nmists at dawn rising off the wilderness lakes where deer and moose came down\r\nto the edge to drink and look up and watch us as we passed along the opposite\r\nshore.",
    " We penetrated deep into the ancient blue spruce and balsam forests,\r\npassed through miles of beech woods and hickory, circled beaver ponds, saw the\r\ntracks of lion and heard the howl of wolves and the coughing bark of bears, were\r\nbrought up short at fast-running, rock-bottomed streams choked with snowmelt\r\nand overflowing their banks and sending us back up into the woods on lumber\r\ntrails in long complex loops until we could return again to the road, which was\r\nnever a real road, only a lonely, wagon-wide path through the northwoods, a\r\ndeer trail become an Indian trail widened by horses and sledges bringing out\r\ntimber and by supply wagons going into the camps.\r\nAs on other such difficult, demanding treks, with little or no sleep, we had\r\ngone a whole day without food, without seeing a settlement or farm or even\r\nanother human being, save for an occasional trapper crossing the trail into the\r\ndeep woods to check his lines, furtive and solitary as a wild animal himself.\r\nWhat did the enslavement of three million Negroes mean to him? Or the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law? Did he know, much less care, who was President? Had he even heard\r\nof abolitionism? Sometimes when I saw one of these pelt-covered, bearded\r\nfellows with his backpack and steel-toothed traps and long-barreled rifle\r\ndisappearing into the wilderness, I almost envied him. His ignorance and single-\r\nminded pursuit of the skins of animals was a kind of innocence that I would\r\nnever know again, if I had ever known it at all.\r\nIt was dawn when we finally arrived at the farm. The overcast sky was soft as\r\nflannel and gray in the east above Tahawus and soot black in the west. It had\r\nrained most of the night, a raw, penetrating rain that had soaked straight\r\nthrough our cloaks and hats and made our bones feel brittle as iron.",
    " As we\r\npulled into the yard, we saw lamplight inside the kitchen and smoke from the\r\nchimney, and Lyman remarked on it, for normally, with Father away, no one\r\nwould be out of bed this early. I think that we both at the same instant realized\r\nwhat had wakened the family, for without saying a word to one another, as we\r\npassed the house, I handed the reins to Watson, and Lyman and I jumped down\r\nfrom the wagon and made for the door.\r\nIt was indeed as we had expected—Susan’s baby had come. Susan’s baby—\r\nLyman’s baby as well. Yet somehow I could not see it that way. Even then, long\r\nbefore I had come to any awareness of the true nature of my feelings for Susan, I\r\nseemed to be cutting Lyman out of his privileges and prerogatives, so that when\r\nI looked from face to face in the warm, dimly lit kitchen and saw only grief and\r\nexhaustion, saw none of the exhilaration and pride that I expected, I did not\r\nthink once of Lyman’s loss. Only of Susan’s, and in some small, illegitimate way,\r\nmy own.\r\nMary slumped at the table with her Bible open before her, but she was not\r\nreading from it; she merely gazed out the window opposite at the slowly\r\nbrightening field and woods beyond. Ruth was seated on the bed next to Susan,\r\nwiping the woman’s face with a damp cloth. Ruth’s expression was grim, tight-\r\nlipped, frightened, but accepting, as if during the night and long hours into dawn\r\nshe had learned some terrible thing about her own coming fate. The other\r\nchildren moved about slowly in their pantaloons and union suits; half-dressed,\r\nsad-faced waifs they seemed, trying to put together a bit of breakfast for\r\nthemselves. The women looked drained and exhausted; they had clearly been up\r\nall night, struggling to bring a child into the world.",
    " Susan herself, mother of the\r\nchild, lay back among the pillows with her eyes closed, her hands beneath the\r\ncovers, all color drained from her face so that she was nearly as white as Ruth,\r\nand for an instant I thought that she had died and felt a moan begin to rise in\r\nmy throat.\r\nThen her eyes blinked open. She turned her head slowly on the pillow and,\r\nexpressionless, looked at her husband and me at the door, the two of us huge\r\nand cold, noisy in our heavy boots and rain-soaked clothes, clumsy, obdurate,\r\nand male, all out of place in this silent, warm, sad company of women and\r\nchildren. I was thinking hard thoughts. So many babies are born dead, you dare\r\nnot wish for them to be born at all.\r\nAnd so many die right after they are born, you wonder why they were allowed\r\nto live in the first place. And if they live awhile, so many soon sicken and die,\r\nyou wish they had died at the start and had not let you learn to love them. The\r\nwomen, they weaken and grow sadder with each loss, but the men, what do they\r\ndo? I thought that they must gnash their teeth and pound the walls with their\r\nfists, as I did then. I balled my right hand into a fist and banged it hard against\r\nthe wall, one, two, three times, each blow stronger than the last, until I thought I\r\nwould bring down the wall like blinded Samson. Then, frightened by my own\r\nfury, I went to a far corner of the room and closed my eyes and wished for words\r\nof prayer, but found none.\r\nIn a strangely cold tone, Ruth said, “The baby was born dead. We have\r\nwrapped it for burial. You will need to dig a grave for it, Owen. Do it now” she\r\nsaid.\r\nI cleared my throat and said, “And Susan? How is she?”\r\nMary spoke then. “She’ll be fine, I’m sure. Do as Ruth said, Owen. Dig the\r\ngrave. Susan will be fine. The midwife from Timbuctoo was over to tend her and\r\nleft only a short while ago.",
    " She knows all the old remedies, and Susan has been\r\ntreated by them. The baby has no name, but we need to bury it, so we can say\r\nour prayers for it. Lyman may want to make a marker, but there’s no need. It\r\nnever drew breath,” she said, and added, almost as afterthought, “It was a baby\r\nboy.”\r\nThroughout, Lyman had not made a sound or a move from the door. He stood\r\nthere now, immobile and as silent as when he had come in. I had tears running\r\ndown my cheeks, yet his eyes were dry and cool, his face impassive. My body\r\nwas hot with rage, and I could barely keep it still, but Lyman stood with his\r\nhands slack at his sides. He was more a carved block of ice in the dead of winter\r\nthan a man. He held himself like that and regarded his wife with strange\r\nplacidity, as if he had come upon her sleeping and did not want to waken her\r\nbut merely wished to watch her awhile without her knowing.\r\nFinally, Susan said in a voice that was almost a whisper, “I’m sorry, Lyman.”\r\nHe twisted his lips as if to clear his mouth of an unpleasant taste, and when a\r\nfew seconds of painful silence had passed, he said, “It was not meant to be.” And\r\nthen abruptly he turned and departed from the house.\r\nI followed him out the door, still shaking with what I thought was rage and\r\ngrief. Unable to say anything useful or comforting to Susan, still unable even to\r\npray, I proceeded at once to follow my stepmother Mary’s order to dig a grave\r\nfor the infant. That would be my use. Then, before I had reached the barn,\r\nLyman came riding out on Adelphi.\r\nI reached up and grabbed the bridle and asked, “Where are you going?”\r\n“Timbuctoo.”\r\n“Why?”\r\n“I’m going to put my cabin straight.”\r\n“What? Why do that now? I don’t understand.”\r\nHe would not look at me. “I’ll be back in a few days, and I’ll be taking Susan\r\nthen.”\r\n“What are you talking about?”\r\n“I’m saying what I’m saying.",
    "”\r\n“But you can’t leave,” I said. “She needs to be here, and she needs to have you\r\nwith her.”\r\n“No. She and I need to be amongst our own people. I don’t want to have to\r\nexplain it to you, Owen. But it ain’t right for us to be living here anymore with\r\nyou Browns. There’s too much gone wrong for us since we moved over here, so\r\nwe’re going to go on back now, soon as Susan’s ready to travel that far.”\r\n“No,” I declared. “You can’t do that.”\r\nHe sighed and shook his head. “Don’t know that you can stop me, Owen, since\r\nthat’s what I’m determined to do.”\r\n“This is Father’s horse you’re riding” I said, as if that would stop him. It\r\nseemed to me almost unthinkable, that he would remove Susan and himself from\r\nour house and return to their bare little cabin in Timbuctoo. Did he think that\r\nwe had cursed him, had put a hex on him?\r\nHe looked down at me with irritation and something like pity on his face.\r\n“Fine,” he said, and he swung down from the horse to the ground, handed me\r\nthe reins, and walked away. I stood there holding the horse and watched in\r\nsilence as he strode across the yard to the road, then down the road in the\r\ndirection of the African settlement, until he was finally gone from sight.\r\nWhen I returned the horse to its stall in the barn, Watson was there, brushing\r\ndown the other Morgan. “I thought Lyman went off on Adelphi,” he said.\r\n“What’s the matter? He was weird.”\r\n“Yes, well, there’s bad news” I said. “Susan’s baby, it was born dead.” His\r\nbright face suddenly went slack and pale. He said nothing, simply stood there\r\nwith the brush in his hand, open-mouthed and silent, as if he had been hit in the\r\nchest and had lost his breath.\r\n“I need help digging the grave, Wat,” I said. “Will you come with me?” I had\r\npicked up the spade and pick and stood by the door.\r\n“Yes, sure. Oh, this is pretty terrible for them, isn’t it?”\r\n“Yes. It’s terrible.",
    "”\r\n“Is Susan all right?”\r\n“Yes. She’ll be fine in a few days.”\r\n“What about Lyman?”\r\n“Lyman’s upset, but he’ll be all right.”\r\n“Where was he off to on Adelphi?”\r\n“Stop asking questions,” I said, handing him the pick. “Just follow me; we’ll\r\ndig the grave.”\r\nHe shrugged his bony shoulders, grabbed up the pick, and traipsed along\r\nbehind me, a pair of gravediggers on a cold, gray, drizzling dawn.\r\nA hundred rods or so beyond the house, in a clearing near a stand of birches,\r\nmy brother Watson and I dug a deep hole in the wet, rocky soil. Afterwards, I\r\nbuilt a small pine box and into it placed the tiny body of the infant wrapped in a\r\nplain, earth-colored scrap of wool and nailed it shut. We never saw the infant\r\nitself; only its humble shroud. Then Watson and I lowered the box into the hole\r\nand filled it and covered the opening in the ground with sod. It would remain\r\nunmarked. And by the time we came seven weeks later to bury Mary’s and\r\nFathers unnamed infant in its unmarked grave, the grass had grown tall over the\r\nfirst grave, and daisies were blooming there, and you could not see where it had\r\nbeen. Although I knew exactly where the first grave was located and saw it\r\nclearly, as if there were a tall, engraved marble stone at its head:\r\nUnnamed Baby, born to Susan & Lyman Epps “We shall not all sleep, but we\r\nshall all be changed”\r\nI Corinthians 15:51\r\nIt was a terrible time then, with the baby born dead and with Lyman and\r\nSusan gone off to live amongst the Negroes in Timbuctoo and with Mary’s own\r\nbirthing date fast approaching—in itself not upsetting, even to me, but it meant\r\nthat Father would soon be coming to North Elba, which now, more than ever\r\nbefore, filled me with nameless dread. Why was his coming so dreadful? He was\r\nmy father. I loved him. I believed that I had done nothing wrong.",
    "\r\nI could only say to myself that it had to do with the disarray that I saw all\r\naround, and I knew he would see it the second he drew up before the house—the\r\nOld Man could smell disorder in the air—and in short order he would set\r\neverything right again. Humiliating me. Even so, I felt strangely paralyzed, and\r\nmy anticipation of his coming only seemed to make it worse.\r\nSpring planting went ahead, but it was more Watson’s and Salmon’s doing\r\nthan mine, and it was done in a desultory fashion; and though we continued to\r\nclear back the forest at a fairly good rate, cutting and burning and pulling\r\nstumps off nearly a half-acre of ground a week, we did it sloppily—\r\nunscientifically, Father would say—like hired laborers without a foreman. And\r\nthe house was falling into steady disrepair, as we could not seem to find the time\r\nor the energy or the wit to repair the damage done to the roof and chimneys by\r\nthe winter winds and ice.\r\nAnd we had no excuses this time; we could not tell ourselves, or report to\r\nFather when he arrived, that we had been too busy doing the Lord’s work to do\r\nour own. We were no longer conductors on the Underground Railroad. Father’s\r\ngreat Subterranean Passway, at least our small section of it, had gone dead.\r\nWithout Lyman to act as liaison between us and the citizens of Timbuctoo, we\r\nwere unable to carry fugitive slaves north. Without Lyman, no one came to us\r\nanymore for help, which disappointed me greatly and made me a failure, not\r\nonly in my own eyes but in the eyes of Watson, and of Salmon, too, who had\r\ngrown as passionate as Watson on the issue of slavery and as eager as he to\r\noppose it.\r\nThey could not understand my reluctance to confront Lyman forthrightly and\r\nhonestly. “Why’n’t you just go over there and make it clear that we’re ready to\r\nrun folks north in our wagon as soon as they show up in Timbuctoo?” Salmon\r\ndemanded.",
    " “Just put it to him, Owen. What’s the big deal between you and\r\nLyman anyhow? So what if he wants to go back and live on his own land in\r\nTimbuctoo? Seems only natural, don’t it?”\r\n“You don’t understand.”\r\n“No, I don’t.”\r\n“He doesn’t want anything more to do with us Browns.”\r\n“Why? Because of Susan’s baby? That can’t be it. We didn’t have anything to\r\ndo with that. It was the Lord’s will.”\r\n“I don’t know, Salmon. You talk to him, if you want. You go over there, and\r\nyou plead with him to provide us with passengers for our wagon and team so\r\nthat we can feel better about ourselves. You tell him how much he needs us to\r\nhelp him help his Negro brethren, Salmon. You know what he’ll say?”\r\n“What?”\r\n“I... I don’t know. I don’t know what he’ll say. I just know that I can’t go to\r\nhim. Not now. Maybe not ever.”\r\n“Sounds crazy to me;’ he said, disgusted. And he did, indeed, that very day of\r\nour conversation, ride out to Timbuctoo all by himself, only to return in the\r\nevening clearly disappointed and not a little confused. He came in at supper and\r\nsat down sullenly at the table without taking off his hat and coat or wiping his\r\nmuddy boots.\r\nIt was Ruth who asked him what Lyman had told him, for she, like everyone\r\nelse in the family, had known why the boy had gone over there. Mary had even\r\nput up a basket of bread and preserves for Salmon to carry to them. I said\r\nnothing, and neither did Watson, who I think had guessed by then that there was\r\nsomething dark and personal between me and Lyman, something that could not\r\nyet be named by either of us, for neither Lyman nor I knew what it was\r\nourselves. We merely felt its power and acted on it, as if we had no choice in the\r\nmatter, as if it were a shared compulsion of some sort, the nature of which\r\nwould become apparent to us and nameable only later, when it no longer\r\ncontrolled us.\r\n“I never even saw him,”Salmon said.",
    " “I tried talking to some others, Mister\r\nGrey and the other Mister Epps, the choirmaster. But they said there was no\r\nUnderground Railroad in Timbuctoo. Like I was some kind of slave-catcher or\r\nsomething. Didn’t know what I was talking about. Lyman, they told me, was\r\ngone off”\r\n“They say where?” Watson asked.\r\n“Nope. Just gone off. You know how they can get when they don’t want you to\r\nknow something. They smile and tell you something half-right and half-wrong,\r\nact like they don’t know the truth any more than you do. ‘Lyman, he gon’ off\r\nsomewheres, Mistah Brown.’ I’m telling you, it was like I was the sheriff or a\r\nslave-catcher, the way they treated me.”\r\n“Did you go to his cabin?” Watson wanted to know.\r\nI remained silent throughout, as if none of this concerned me. “Yep. And it\r\nlooked like he’d been doing some work on it. Has himself a pretty decent\r\nkitchen-garden under way, too. I even saw Susan,” he said, and I put down my\r\nknife and spoon and looked up.\r\nIt had been just over a month since they had left, that long since I had seen\r\nher, and suddenly, upon hearing her name in my brother’s mouth, imagining\r\nhim in her presence, I realized that during those thirty-odd days and nights I had\r\nthought of almost no one else. Her face, her voice, her shape and movement, had\r\nconstantly been in my mind. No matter what I was doing, no matter whom I was\r\ntalking to, it was Susan I was thinking of, missing, pining for, longing to speak\r\nto. And to touch. Lyman, whenever I thought of him, as indeed I frequently did,\r\ncame to my mind only as an obstacle to my reaching his wife. He was a curtain\r\nblocking my view, a rock rolled into my path, a palisado surrounding the object\r\nof my desire.\r\nThat I had not once, until this moment, stepped back from my thoughts and\r\nobserved their peculiar nature shocked and alarmed me.",
    " But that’s how powerful\r\nthey were, how all-consuming. Once I knew my thoughts, however, I was first\r\nappalled and then instantly repelled. Of course! I reasoned. This was the source\r\nof the pain between me and Lyman. And he had known it long before I did,\r\nsurely. He had seen that I was in love with his wife, and naturally, as soon as he\r\ncould, he had withdrawn her from me.\r\nMy blood washed over me. I felt absurd, and then guilty, and wished only that\r\nI could somehow purge myself of my love for Susan and make amends to Lyman.\r\nIt also occurred to me that this had been the source of my anxiety about Father’s\r\nimminent arrival in North Elba: I was afraid that he would ask after Lyman and\r\nSusan, and when I replied that we had not seen them since their return to\r\nTimbuctoo, he would look me in the eye, and he would know at once what I\r\nmyself had gone months without even guessing.\r\nAbruptly, I stood up and left the house. It was nearly dark, the temperature\r\ndropping fast as the sun sank behind the mountains, with the smell of mud and\r\nmelting snow mingling in the cold air. I went behind the barn and walked up to\r\nthe grove of young birches there and cut off a switch and stripped it of its new,\r\nred buds. Back inside the barn, in the darkness, with the animals shifting their\r\nweight quietly in their stalls, I barred the door and stood in the middle of the\r\nlarge room. I pulled off my shirt and drew the top of my union suit to my waist,\r\nexposing my naked upper body to the chilled dark. Then I began to beat my\r\nchest and back with the switch—slowly and lightly at first, then faster and with\r\ngreater force, and soon I was doing it with genuine fervor. But it was not\r\nenough. The switch was too light and broke off in my hand.",
    "\r\nFor a moment, I stood half-naked and foolish, out of breath, angry at myself,\r\nas if I were an iron object that I had stumbled against in the dark. I remembered\r\nFather’s strip of cowhide, which he kept out here to discipline and chastize the\r\nyounger children, although he rarely used it nowadays. I knew exactly where it\r\nwas, hung on a nail by the door. It was short, not quite a yard long, but heavy\r\nand stiff and dry with disuse, with a sharp edge to it. I reached out in the dark\r\nand took it down. The strip of old leather felt in my hand like a weapon. I had\r\nnot actually held it myself since childhood, since that time when Father had\r\nbade me beat him with it, when it had felt alive to me, like a serpent. Now the\r\nquirt was dead, heavy, an almost wooden extension of my arm, as if my right\r\nhand were grasping my crippled left, and I whisked it through the air and struck\r\nmyself with it many times—perhaps a hundred strokes, perhaps more. The pain\r\nwas very great. I thrashed myself around in the darkness, slamming myself\r\nagainst the walls and stalls, knocking over tools and sending buckets flying,\r\nthrashing like a man caught by a seizure, until at last I was faint from the pain\r\nand exhausted and fell to my knees and did not get up.\r\nBut the scourging did not work. Nothing would work to purge my thoughts of\r\nSusan or alleviate my guilt for having betrayed Lyman. Not prayer, certainly. I\r\nprayed so constantly and loudly in the days following that Ruth and the boys\r\nteased me and said that I was practicing for Father’s return, and Mary told them\r\nto leave me be, I was only doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord; she\r\nwished the rest of the family were as devout as I.",
    " But in all my prayers I heard\r\nno voice except my own, and my own repulsed me, until eventually I could not\r\nbear to hear it anymore and gave off prayer altogether and did not join them in\r\nthe evenings or when they went to church on the Sabbath. I went generally\r\nsilent on all matters, not just religion, which was how people were used to me\r\nanyway.\r\nI thought that I might cleanse myself with work, but that, too, was to no effect,\r\nfor I was too distracted and anxious to complete any single task without rushing\r\noff to begin another, and all I accomplished was to create an even greater\r\ndisarray and disorder on the place than had existed before. Trees half-cut or, if\r\ncut, left to lie and rot on the ground; chimneys pulled apart and not put back\r\ntogether again; fenceposts driven into the ground but left standing without rails\r\nto connect them; half-a-dozen rows plowed, but then the horse unhitched, taken\r\noff to haul stones from the river, with the plow abandoned in the middle of the\r\nfield: it rained for most of those days, and I rushed about as if every day there\r\nwere a bright sun overhead, a madman farmer, and my brothers and sisters and\r\nstepmother watched me with fear and bewilderment. My family kept the house\r\nrunning smoothly and the livestock fed and properly cared for, whilst I made a\r\nmess of the rest.\r\nThere was no way for me to tell them of the source of such turbulence; I was\r\ntoo ashamed. And besides, as the days went on, I myself had grown as fearful\r\nand bewildered as they, for I was no longer sure that my strong feelings for\r\nSusan were generated by love for her, so much as by a morbid, cruel desire to\r\ntake away from Lyman his greatest treasure. I did not love her; I hated him.\r\nWhat perversity was this?\r\nI needed Father to arrive home.",
    " Only he, I believed, could provide me with the\r\norder and structure of thought capable of leading me out of this wilderness of\r\ntangled desire and rage. Come home, Father! I began to say to myself, as I raced\r\nuphill and down. Come home and control me, Old Man. Bring me back to\r\nmyself. Come and deliver me over to a thing larger than these strangely\r\ndisordered longings. Tell me what it is I must do, and I will do it.\r\nThen, suddenly one morning, there was the Old Man, appearing in our midst like\r\nthe missing main character in a play, taking over the stage and putting everyone\r\nelse at once into a supporting role. Which was how we wanted it, of course.\r\nWithout Father, we had no hero for our play, and whenever he was absent, we\r\nundertook our parts without purpose or understanding. We forgot our lines,\r\npositioned ourselves wrongly on the stage, confused friend with foe, and lost all\r\nsight of our desired end and its opposition. Without the Old Man, tragedy\r\nquickly became farce.\r\nFather seemed to know this and almost to welcome it, for when he returned\r\nhome after a long while away, he always came with a fury, bearing down on us\r\nlike a storm, crackling with noise and electrical energy, full of clear, irresistible\r\npurpose and making thunderous statement of it. He appraised the situation in a\r\nsecond, and before he was even off his horse, the man was barking out orders,\r\nschedules, and plans, was making announcements, establishing sequences, goals,\r\nstandards, setting everyone at once diligently to work for the common good.\r\nAccompanied this time by Mr. Clarke, the Yankee shipper from Westport, he\r\nbrought supplies, seed, flour, salt, and nails. For the younger children, little gifts\r\n—a new Bible for Sarah, a box of paints for Annie, a penknife for Oliver—and\r\nfor Mary, a silk handkerchief: all presented first thing, unceremoniously, off-\r\nhandedly, as a greeting.",
    " For Salmon, Watson, and me, he had firm handshakes\r\nand quick commands to help unload the supplies from the wagon, so Mr. Clarke\r\ncould move on and make his other deliveries in the settlement before nightfall.\r\nHe would be returning here in the morning to pick up our furs and as many\r\nfleeces as we were able to release to him: that would be Oliver’s job, counting\r\nand tying for shipment and sale the spring fleeces and the winter’s catch of pelts\r\n—beaver, lynx, marten, and fisher. That’s what Mr. Clarke especially wanted.\r\nFather said to get going now, son, that’s a big job, and something was telling\r\nhim that some of those pelts still needed scraping before they were ready for\r\nmarket, and the other boys were going to be too busy to help him. Mr. Clarke\r\ndrove a hard bargain and would not accept a bloody hide, Father warned.\r\nUp on his wagon, Mr. Clarke laughed and recalled for Father how he had lost\r\nto him his best pair of Morgans, thanks to Father’s nigger, which brought to\r\nFather’s attention the absence of Lyman and Susan. He scanned our little group\r\nout there in the yard before the house—Mary hugely pregnant and beaming with\r\npleasure at the sight of her husband; Ruth tall and slender and fairly bursting\r\nwith the secret of Henry Thompson’s promise to ask for her hand in marriage;\r\nSalmon, Watson, and I already lugging barrels from Mr. Clarke’s wagon to the\r\nbarn; the little girls, Sarah and Annie, as if honored by the task, together holding\r\nthe bridle of Father’s horse, a fine sorrel mare which I recognized as having once\r\nbelonged to Mr. Gerrit Smith, and, indeed, it did later turn out to be a gift from\r\nhim.\r\nFather asked where were our friends, referring to them as Mr. and Mrs. Epps, a\r\ntacit correction to Mr. Clarke.\r\nI paused at the rear of the wagon, a keg of nails on my shoulder, and Father\r\ncaught my eye. “Owen?",
    "” he said, as if I were the sole reason for their absence.\r\nMary said, “I would have written about it to you, Mister Brown, but I thought\r\nyou were coming sooner than this.”\r\nMy silence probably told him as much as any words could have then. He\r\nnodded and said that we would discuss this later, meaning after Mr. Clarke had\r\nleft us. I quickly went back to my work, and Father resumed issuing orders, even\r\nas he dismounted and embraced Mary and walked arm in arm with her towards\r\nthe house. Over his shoulder, he instructed Salmon to kindly water the horse\r\nwhen he had finished unloading, and brush her down and set her out to pasture\r\nwithout feeding her grain, as shed been fed this morning in Keene. Not at Mr.\r\nPartridge’s, you can be sure of that, he added. Her name was Reliance, he said,\r\nand she was reliable. And then to Watson he said that he could see fencing half\r\nup, half lying on the ground, and hed better set to work on that at once, boy, or\r\nwe’ll be chasing cattle day and night. And me he instructed to check Mr. Clarke’s\r\nbill of lading against our goods received and sign it for him, then put myself to\r\nwork on getting the south meadow turned under by nightfall, so we can harrow\r\nand plant tomorrow. He had observed coming down from the notch that the\r\nfrost was well out of the ground there. “Come to the house at noon for dinner,”\r\nhe said to me, “and we’ll lay out the rest of the planting then. We have lots of\r\nhard work to do, boys, so put yourselves to it! I’ll examine the place and view\r\nthe livestock in a while this morning and will travel over to Timbuctoo this\r\nafternoon. By this evening,” he declared, “we will all know who we are and what\r\nwe’re doing here!”\r\nAnd then he was gone into the house.\r\nSilence. Watson, Salmon, and I looked somberly, gingerly, at one another.\r\nThen Watson shook his head and grinned.",
    " “Well, I guess the Old Man’s back,” he\r\nfinally said. “Hoo-rah, hoo-rah.”\r\n“Yep,” said Salmon. “Cap’n Brown’s home for three minutes, and we already\r\ngot our marching orders. He ain’t gonna be very happy when he finds out about\r\nLyman, though.”\r\n“I don’t know,” Watson said. “The Old Man’ll set it right. He has a way with\r\nNegroes.”\r\nMr. Clarke laughed. “Your old man has a way with white folks, too,” he said,\r\nhis spectacles glinting like mica in the morning sun. “Talked me into giving him\r\nmore credit than I ever give a poor man nowadays.”\r\n“You’ll get your money,’ I said. “Don’t fret yourself”\r\n“Yeah, well, we’ll see, Red. We’ll see how them pelts and fleeces add up,” he\r\nsaid, and handed me a stub of a pencil and the bill of lading, which I signed with\r\na surly flourish, John Brown, by his son Owen Brown, and as I wrote the date, I\r\nrealized that tomorrow was Father’s birthday.\r\nI was twenty-seven that spring. When Father was my age, he had been married\r\nfor nearly a decade and had fathered four children. His wife, my mother, had not\r\nyet died. When he was my age, he had already made himself a professional\r\nsurveyor, had established a successful tannery that employed two grown men\r\nand four or five boys, had built a house, raised a herd of blooded sheep, cleared\r\ntwenty acres of hardwood forest and carved a farm out of the wilderness of\r\nwestern Pennsylvania. He had founded a settlement school, and when he was my\r\nage, at a time when most respectable white people preferred that folks show\r\nslavery their blind eye, he had publically pledged his life to its overthrow. At\r\ntwenty-seven, he knew what he stood for, what he could and could not do. At\r\nmy age, Father had become in all visible ways a man.\r\nAnd here was I, still a boy. How was that possible? In what crucial ways was\r\nmy nature so different from his that our lives and works would diverge by this\r\nmuch?",
    "\r\nJohn had once said to me, in a complaining tone, that Father had taught us to\r\nbe afraid of no man except him. And it was true. Father always insisted that we\r\nthink for ourselves in every way, except when we disagreed with him, and that\r\nwe hold ourselves independent of every man’s will, except his. He wanted us\r\nsimultaneously to be independent and yet to serve him. Father was to be our\r\nAbraham; we were to be his little Isaacs. We were supposed to know ahead of\r\ntime, however, the happy outcome of the story—we were supposed to know that\r\nit was a story, not about us and our willingness to lie on a rock on Mount Moriah\r\nand be sacrificed under his knife, but about our father and his willingness to\r\nobey his terrible God. That was the difference between us and our father. We\r\nhad him for a father, and he had someone else.\r\nHis father, like ours, had taught his son John to be independent of all men, but\r\nGrandfather had included himself, the teacher, amongst them. He, too, like\r\nFather, had told the story of Abraham and Isaac to his eldest son, but he had told\r\nit in such a way that it was not about the nature of obedience or sacrifice; it was\r\nabout the nature of God. Grandfather Brown was a gentle, rational man whose\r\ngreatest difficulty was in accommodating his character to a cruel and\r\ninexplicable universe, and unlike his son, he was not bound by a lifelong\r\nstruggle to overcome his own willfulness and vanity. It’s their own secret\r\nstruggles that shape the stories people tell their children. And had I been blessed\r\nwith a son of my own, the story would have been told yet a third way. The\r\ncentral figure in it would have been neither Abraham nor God. It would have\r\nbeen Isaac, and the questions my story asked and answered would have been\r\nIsaac’s alone.",
    "\r\nI would have told my son that Isaac’s father, Abraham, rose up early in the\r\nmorning and led Isaac up into the mountain of Moriah, claiming that he had\r\nbeen directed to do this by God, in order there to make a sacrifice unto Him.\r\nAnd Isaac believed his father, for he loved him and had never known him to lie.\r\nAnd when they had reached the mountaintop and Isaac’s father had clave the\r\nwood for the burnt offering and Isaac saw no lamb there, the boy spoke unto\r\nAbraham, his father, saying, “Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the\r\nlamb for the burnt offering?” And his father said unto Isaac, “God will provide a\r\nlamb.” But when Isaac saw his father come forward with a rope and a knife in\r\nhis hands to bind and slay him upon the altar they had built together, he\r\nunderstood that he himself was to be the lamb. He was afraid and asked himself,\r\nDid he love his father so greatly that he could not flee from Moriah back into\r\nCanaan, where lay his aged mother, Sarah, or that he could not follow his\r\nfather’s bondswoman Hagar and her son, Ishmael, who was his brother, into the\r\nwilderness of Beersheba? He said to his father, “I heard not this command from\r\nGod. It comes to me only from thee, and thou art not the Lord, nor canst thou\r\nspeak for Him. For thou hast taught me that, and I have believed it, and\r\ntherefore now I must flee from this place, or else abandon all that thou hast\r\ntaught me.” Whereupon his father fell down upon the ground and said that an\r\nangel of the Lord was calling to him out of heaven, saying, “Abraham, Abraham,\r\nlay not thine hand upon the lad, for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing\r\nthat thou hast not withheld thy son from me.",
    "” And Isaac showed his father\r\nwhere behind him a ram had been caught in a thicket by his horns, and\r\nAbraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the\r\nstead of Isaac, and father and son prayed together, giving thanks unto the Lord,\r\nand descended together from the mountain feeling wise and greatly blessed by\r\nthe Lord. That is the story I would tell.\r\nIn the evening, after supper, Father bade me give him my views regarding\r\nLyman’s decision to live away from us. I knew that he had already spoken with\r\nLyman himself that same afternoon in Timbuctoo and had heard his version, and\r\nthat he had obtained Mary’s view of the matter as well. The former I knew\r\nnothing about, for I had not spoken with Lyman myself since the day he\r\ndeparted from us; the latter I knew to be one of placid, unquestioning\r\nacceptance: as far as Mary was concerned, Lyman had decided that he and Susan\r\ncould live more naturally on their own land among their own people, that was\r\nall. “And perfectly understandable, too,” Mary said, when Father raised the\r\nsubject. “Especially after the disappointment of the baby.” We were all gathered\r\nin the parlor, where Father was preparing to lead us in prayer.\r\n“Yes. The baby” he said, closing his eyes and looking down as if to pray for its\r\nsoul. We stood in silence for a moment, and the soul of the infant born dead did\r\nseem to flit through the room and then swiftly disappear. That was how it was\r\nwhenever Father was present—the entire spirit world was strangely enlivened.\r\nThen Father said, “I urged them today to come here and retrieve its body and re-\r\nbury it properly in the Negro burying ground over there. I assume they’ll do it\r\ntomorrow. But before they do, I want to know how it goes between you, Owen,\r\nand Mister Epps in particular. And with all the Negroes, too, not just him.",
    " I\r\nperceive a point of strain, a serious weakness in our relations with them, son.\r\nAnd I believe that you are the fault,” he said. “Give me simply your views on\r\nwhy they’ve separated from us and, a thing which distresses me much more, why\r\nthe Underground Railroad no longer runs through this valley. The two are\r\nobviously connected.”\r\nEveryone in the family looked at me, except for Father, who had opened his\r\nBible and appeared to be studying tonight’s reading from the Scriptures. “Yes,\r\nprobably they are connected,” I said. “No other whites in the settlement are\r\nwilling to carry fugitives north. They are as cowardly as ever. More so, of course,\r\nsince the Fugitive Act. And the Negroes themselves dare not try it, either. Except\r\nfor Lyman. But Lyman chooses not to enlist our aid anymore, and he has no\r\nwagon, not even a single horse or mule. So there it is. No one goes north\r\nanymore, unless on foot, and that apparently has discouraged the conductors\r\nbelow from sending fugitives on to North Elba. Instead, they take the greater risk\r\nof sending folks by way of the Lake Champlain route and the Rochester-to-\r\nNiagara route.”\r\n“Well, that’s been taken care of Father said. “I’ve today written to Mister\r\nDouglass and a person in Utica whom I cannot name. Service will resume\r\nshortly. But you still haven’t told me your view of Mister Epps’s departure from\r\nus.”\r\n“What did he tell you himself?”\r\n“He would say nothing on the subject.”\r\n“Nothing?”\r\n“No, nothing, Owen.”\r\n“Then I can say nothing, either.”\r\nHe looked up and studied my face for a long moment. I remember the sound of\r\nGrandfather’s clock ticking. Then he said, “Very well, Owen. It shall remain\r\nbetween you and Mister Epps. Let us pray, children.” And in his usual manner,\r\nhe began to pray.",
    "\r\nIt was only a matter of days before the Old Man had the farm up and running\r\nagain—which pleased me, of course, but alloyed my pleasure at the same time\r\nwith a measure of guilt. A few days more, and he had resumed service on the\r\nUnderground Railroad between Timbuctoo and Canada, an activity which of\r\nnecessity I joined. But sullenly at first, I confess, for its resumption was based on\r\nFather’s having re-established his old close and trusting relations with Lyman\r\nand the other Negroes of the settlement. Within a few short weeks, it was as if\r\nthe Old Man had never left. He returned to preaching every second or third\r\nSabbath at the Congregational Church in North Elba, a church he nonetheless\r\nwould not formally join, and he undertook once again to conduct his weekly\r\nclass on the Bible, which was attended by sometimes as many as a dozen men\r\nand women of the village, white and black. He happily approved of young Henry\r\nThompson’s wish to marry Ruth and used it as an opportunity to bridge the\r\ndistance that had marred relations between our two families, bringing the\r\nThompsons into the abohtionist fold once again, and where the Thompsons\r\nwent, many other local families went as well.\r\nFather’s physical presence could inspire people, could instill in them a quantity\r\nof courage even to the point of recklessness, which, when he was not himself\r\nphysically present to argue, chide, and explain, seemed to dissipate as fast as it\r\nhad arisen. It was not so much his oratory that did it, although to be sure he\r\nspoke well and preached with conviction and imagination on any number of\r\nsubjects, from abolitionism to animal husbandry, from the Bible, which he knew\r\nbetter than any trained and ordained preacher I had ever met, to the United\r\nStates Constitution, which he knew like a Washington lawyer. But it was not his\r\noratory that swayed people.",
    " Quite the opposite, in fact.\r\nInstead, folks were impressed and then, perhaps to their surprise, led by his\r\nstubborn refusal to rely on common oratorical devices and embellishments, by\r\nhis evident disdain for the tricks of voice and gesture that most public speakers\r\nrelied on in those days. As if he were a Channing or a Parker or a white\r\nFrederick Douglass, he made people feel empowered by having come in contact\r\nwith him, so that they felt larger, stronger, more righteous, clearer of purpose\r\nand more sure of victory than they ever had before. But unlike those exemplary\r\nspeakers, Channing, Parker, Douglass, and so on, Father never lifted his voice,\r\nnever shouted, never pointed to the heavens, never quoted Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson—he never quoted any writer, except for those who wrote the Bible, the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and the United States Constitution.\r\nThe effect of Father’s speech and personal presence on otherwise rational and\r\neven skeptical men and women was uncanny and never failed to amaze me. No\r\nmatter the audience—a hall filled with illustrious New England abolitionists or a\r\nconvention of hundreds of distinguished Negroes, his country congregation at\r\nchurch on the Sabbath or a gathering of Negro farmers at a barn-raising in\r\nTimbuctoo, a meeting of his fallen-away white neighbors in North Elba or his\r\nown family gathered around the fire at home—Father always spoke simply and\r\ndirectly, his hands at his sides or merely clasped in front of him, an ordinary\r\nman in a plain brown suit who happened to possess the truth.",
    " Some of it was his\r\nsense of timing: he had an instinct for knowing when to remain silent so as to\r\ngather everyone’s attention and when to speak so that it would sound most\r\nimpressive; thus, when he was expected to speak up, he often held his peace and\r\nstood against the furthest wall, and when he was expected to go silent and\r\nwithdraw, he suddenly came forward and gave sharp utterance to his thoughts.\r\nHis voice was in no way stentorian or authoritative: it was pitched at not quite\r\nthe level of a tenor’s. Most people who wrote about him afterwards regarded\r\nhim as tall and well-built, a man of heroic proportions, but Father was of\r\naverage height, tanned and sinewy, strong but not bulky or broad, and he\r\nwalked like a soldier on parade, straight-backed and a little stiff-legged, with his\r\narms swinging. His face was essentially that of a Yankee farmer: sharp-nosed,\r\nwith tight lips and a jutting chin and a rough-hewn maris large ears sticking out\r\nbeneath his coarse, reddish-gray hair, which he wore cropped short and spikey,\r\nlike a stevedore’s. The visible center of his face was in his eyes, pale gray and\r\nfierce and steady. When the Old Man locked his gaze onto yours, it was very\r\ndifficult not to give way before it, as if he’d seen your secret shame. Like an owl\r\nor a hawk, a powerful bird of prey, he rarely blinked. He could hold your gaze\r\nwith his as if with physical force, as if he had reached out and clamped onto\r\nyour chin and cheeks with both hands and had drawn your face up to his so that\r\nhe could stare directly into it; and look into it he did, deeply, with curiosity and\r\nundisguised self-interest, as if he were examining, not a human soul, but a\r\ncomplex, unfamiliar piece of machinery, which, if properly understood, might\r\nsave him a lifetime’s labor.",
    "\r\nIn early June, as Mary came close to her time, we were conducting to Canada an\r\nelderly couple whose sons had gone before them the previous year and a young\r\nboy accompanied by his gentle, bespectacled uncle. All four had escaped off the\r\nsame Maryland plantation, which had become notorious along the Railroad, due\r\nto the cruelty of its master, a Dutchman named Hammlicher, and to the\r\nparticular viciousness of his white overseer, a man named Camden, and due to\r\nthe fact that Harriet Tubman herself had taken a special interest in facilitating\r\nthe escape of the Hammlicher slaves. Mysterious, elusive, and yet seemingly\r\neverywhere at once, Miss Tubman was thought to have had a family connection\r\namong the Hammlicher slaves, through one of her own lost children, perhaps,\r\nand thus had lent it her special attention. Already at least fifteen of the several\r\nhundred human beings owned by this man had been spirited up along the\r\nChesapeake Bay to Philadelphia and New York and thence on up the Hudson to\r\nTroy and freedom. But now, because of the increase in the number of slave-\r\ncatchers in those cities along the old route, Miss Tubman had decided to send\r\nher charges north across the Adirondacks by way of Timbuctoo.\r\nWhen Father had met her in Hartford that winter, he had convinced her of the\r\ngood use to which she might put this previously obscure route, and his personal\r\nconnection with her, when he revealed it to the Timbuctoo Negroes, had\r\ninstantly won them back. Father’s reputation for honesty was such that no one\r\nquestioned his claim; it was sufficient unto itself. How could they have refused\r\nto ally themselves with John Brown, when he came to them with the\r\nendorsement of the famous Harriet Tubman? The great Harriet! The General!",
    "\r\nNone of them had ever met her or even seen her at a distance—she was all\r\nlegend to them, one of the great African women, like Sojourner Truth, who\r\nseemed less a modern American saboteur of slavery than an ancient spirit-leader,\r\nan invincible, sometimes invisible, female warrior protected by the old African\r\ngods. Father’s having met and, at the instigation of Frederick Douglass, having\r\nspoken privately with Miss Tubman gave him an authority that at once renewed\r\nLyman’s commitment to running fugitives with us Browns and drew with him\r\nmore of the others in the settlement than we would need. It made our Timbuctoo\r\nstop on the Underground Railroad suddenly important in the only world that\r\nmattered to the Negroes and to Father, and once again, increasingly as the\r\nsummer wore on, the only one that mattered to me.\r\nSlavery, slavery, slavery! I could not have a thought that was not somehow\r\nlinked to it. It was an obsession. At times, it came to feel like a form of insanity,\r\nfor I was incapable of a normal thought, a single private thought that began and\r\nended with me and did not identify me as a white man. And this was all due to\r\nFather.\r\nIt was during our run with the four Hammlicher fugitives that Mary came to her\r\ntime. And before we were able to get back from the Canadian border to North\r\nElba, she gave birth to a son, her next-to-last child, born strangled and crushed\r\nby the terrible trial of his birth, leaving Mary herself nearly dead and Father\r\nfrantic with fear that he would lose her.\r\nThe excitement of our run to Canada had made our blood race, and we were\r\nstill thrilled by it when we returned home.",
    " It was almost as if we had Miss\r\nTubman herself aboard, her long rifle at the ready, and for the first time in\r\nmonths there was no tension between me and Lyman, which put even Father\r\ninto a jolly mood as we rode the wagon back down along the rough roads from\r\nMassena. We had passed a party of Indian hunters along the way, Abenakis,\r\nFrench-speaking Algonquins from Lower Canada, a remnant of a remnant\r\npeople, and had engaged in deep speculation amongst ourselves as to their racial\r\norigins, Lyman arguing for ancient Africa, Father for Asia, and Watson for the\r\nLost Tribes of Israel.\r\nThen, when we arrived at the farm, we were met by the grim sight of a\r\nbirthing gone bad, the sad familiarity of it, the desolation and dashed hopes and\r\nexpectations, the terrible, bloody, failed work of it, and all our male heartiness\r\nand camaraderie, our blustery pride in our good and difficult work, went\r\nsuddenly silent and cold. Men go numb at these times, I discovered. That’s what\r\nthey do. All feeling bleeds out of us. We suddenly realize that we know nothing\r\nof what it means to the woman who has carried this child inside her body for\r\nnine months and has suffered through the excruciating pain and work of bearing\r\nit and has had to see its tiny body emerge into the world lifeless, battered and\r\nbruised by the vain effort, a grotesque, sorrowful waste. We do think sorrow and\r\ngrief and pity. But we feel nothing. Husbands, fathers, sons, and brothers, we all\r\nrespond the same way.",
    " First we say to ourselves that we are to blame, then we\r\nsay that we are unfairly deprived; we are the cause, we are not the agent; we are\r\nthe custodian, we are a mere bystander: every feeling is cut down by its near\r\nopposite, so that in the end we come up numb, silent, too large, too rough, too\r\ncoarse, too healthy and strong, to be in the same room with the poor, devastated\r\nwomen, our shattered, weary mothers, wives, daughters, and sisters.\r\nNumb. Cold. This, I know, was how Father felt that June afternoon when we\r\nmen, dirty, exhausted, full of our own importance and valor, entered the house\r\nand saw that Mary’s baby had been born dead. We are there at the beginning\r\nand almost never at the end. Father, Watson, Salmon, Oliver, and I, and it was\r\nhow Lyman felt, too, and how he had felt when his own baby was born dead, I\r\nnow understood. There’s no way to change this; we are men and must remain\r\nmen. It was how my brothers felt, their young faces dark and worried with the\r\nfruitless search for an appropriate emotion. And it was how I felt. Numb. Cold.\r\nBut so different was it from when I had exploded with rage on the raw, gray\r\nmorning seven weeks before, when Susan’s baby was born dead, that I was\r\nforced to remember the earlier event anew and this time to regard it with\r\ndismay. My rage then made no sense to me now. Lyman’s silence and\r\nwithdrawal, which had seemed strange to me then, I now saw as having been\r\nthe only sensible, normal response for a man. I should have reacted as he had.\r\nFrom what hole in my unconscious mind had that rage of mine emerged? Why\r\nhad I not reacted instead with this all-too-familiar, cold cancellation of feeling\r\nthat surrounded me now?",
    "\r\nI saw that my anger had been caused not by Susan’s suffering and loss at all\r\nbut by my guilt for wishing that I could have stood that morning in Lyman’s\r\nplace instead of mine, for believing somehow that I should have been Susan’s\r\nhusband and the father of her dead infant and should not have been this farmer\r\nstanding at his side. I had felt guilt but could not show it, even to myself, and so\r\nI had pounded the walls with my fists and roared like a wounded lion. Lyman\r\nhad instinctively understood the nature and source of my rage, and he had\r\nhastily withdrawn himself and his wife from my presence and had stayed away\r\nfrom us, until now, until Father had returned and displaced me and reshaped the\r\nfamily and its priorities. Until once again it was slavery, slavery, slavery. And—\r\ninescapably—race, race, race. Until once again, due to our obsession, we were,\r\nas it were, insane. Which to the Negroes, to Lyman, made us perfectly\r\ncomprehensible and trustworthy—sane. Not just another dangerous batch of\r\nwell-intentioned, Christian white folks.\r\nMary’s recovery from her delivery was slow and erratic. It had, in fact, been\r\nmany years since she had been able to return to her normal state of good health\r\nfollowing a pregnancy; she was no longer young, after all, and this had been an\r\nespecially difficult and painful birthing, leaving her physically devastated,\r\nwithout even the joy of a new infant to help her heal.\r\nFather managed to obtain several postponements of trial downstate, where he\r\nhad been scheduled to defend himself and Mr. Perkins against their creditors,\r\nand he by-passed the July convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in\r\nSyracuse, so that he could stay at the side of his wife throughout this period of\r\nher recovery.",
    " Night and day, he prayed at her side and nursed her back to health\r\nin his inimitable, tireless fashion, leaving most of the work on the farm and the\r\nrisk and work of running the Underground Railroad to his sons and Lyman and\r\nthe other residents of Timbuctoo. But it was not clear, until nearly a month had\r\npassed, that Mary would recover at all. She waxed and waned, came forward\r\nand fell back, with the entire family growing increasingly fretful. Each day\r\ncommenced with an announcement from Father as to our mother’s condition,\r\nfollowed by appropriate family prayers, either for her continued good progress\r\ntowards health or for a fresh resumption of that progress. Happily, the Lord\r\nblessed us all, and slowly the good woman began to come around, and from\r\nmidsummer on, her progress was steady and in a straight line, until Father was\r\nfreed once again to resume his normal activities at his usual, furious pace,\r\nexercising over us and everyone associated with those activities his characteristic\r\nauthority and force.\r\nThe farm was flourishing, religion was properly established, and our white\r\nneighbors had begun again to join us in aiding our black neighbors and the\r\nfugitive slaves. Sister Ruth and Henry Thompson were set to marry in the fall, as\r\nsoon as Henry and his brothers finished building the couple a proper cabin on a\r\npiece of land that his father had deeded over to them. Miss Tubman and\r\nassociates of Mr. Douglass were steadily sending escaped slaves north to us from\r\nUtica, Syracuse, and Troy, two and sometimes three times a fortnight, and\r\nthough ours was a difficult route, it was now the safest, as slave-catchers and\r\ntheir helpers no longer dared to come slinking around North Elba or Timbuctoo.",
    "\r\nThe word was out: the mad abolitionist, John Brown, and his sons and neighbors\r\nand a pack of Gerrit Smith’s niggers were holed up there in the mountains all\r\narmed and ready to drive off anyone who came looking for fugitives.\r\nEmboldened by this change in the community, the residents of Timbuctoo\r\nbegan to move about the settlement more freely and to mingle with the whites\r\nin a more regular fashion, showing up at barn-raisings, for instance, in\r\nconsiderable numbers and taking their ease down at the grist mill or joining the\r\nwhites after church at a huckleberry-picking prayer picnic up on the sunny\r\nslopes of Whiteface Mountain. On several of these occasions, I saw Susan, always\r\nat a distance from her, which distance I studiously kept, but each time I saw her\r\n—a glimpse of her coffee-brown face, half-hidden by her bonnet, or her shoulder\r\nand arm, visible for a second, until a crowd of Negroes surrounded her—my\r\nheart pounded like a hammer, and the blood rushed to my ears, and if I\r\nhappened to be speaking with a person, I began to stammer and had to lapse\r\ninto silence or else sound foolish as a mooncalf. I averted my gaze and then stole\r\nglances out from under it, until she disappeared from my sight.\r\nShe, of course, made no attempt to speak with me. Nor did Lyman, when he\r\nwas with her. Any initiative would have to be mine, and I had neither the\r\ncourage nor the clarity to take it.\r\nI know now what was the cause and true nature of my fixation on the woman,\r\nhow thwarted and misshapen it was, how far from its true object; but I did not\r\nunderstand it then in the least. I was ashamed of it, naturally; but ashamed for\r\nall the wrong reasons.",
    "\r\nOften, at an hour close to dawn, I found myself, after a long night of prowling\r\nalone through the forests, lurking in the close vicinity of the cabins of\r\nTimbuctoo, peering through the mist and the languorous, sifting pines at the\r\nvery cabin where she slept beside her husband. I would crouch in low bushes for\r\nhours, lost in a sort of reverie, my heart furiously pounding, my hands\r\ntrembling, my legs weak and watery, as if I were a hunter who at last had\r\nsighted his long-sought prey. Then I would suddenly shudder and come back to\r\nmyself and, horrified, would steal away home.\r\nThese prowls were not unlike my sordid, secret, nighttime walks several years\r\nearlier in the streets and alleyways of Springfield, and my family accepted them\r\nmore or less as they had then, which is to say, as evidence of a solitary young\r\nman’s restless nature. And to a degree, they were correct to think that. Also, I\r\nalways carried my rifle and sometimes brought home the carcass of a raccoon or\r\nfisher or some other nocturnal animal, as explanation for my having been out so\r\nlate and long. As long as they did not interfere with my work on the farm, Father\r\ndid not acknowledge my late night absences; perhaps he did not even notice\r\nthem, so preoccupied was he that summer, first with Mary’s long recovery, then\r\nwith the planting and further clearing of our woodlands, and with his local\r\nabolitionist activities and the Railroad. Also, he was busily educating his\r\nneighbors as to the advantages and virtues of raising blooded stock by selling\r\nthem some of his Spanish merino ewes and carting his best ram around for stud\r\nand showing off and now and then selling one of his red Devon cattle.",
    " After\r\nlengthy negotiations by mail with a farmer in Litchfield, Connecticut, whom he\r\nknew from his past dealings with Wadsworth & Wells, he had succeeded in\r\nhaving a fine young Devon bull delivered as far north as Westport for him. I do\r\nnot know how he paid for it, as such an animal did not come cheaply; possibly\r\nwith promises of eventual returns from stud fees, possibly with a portion of the\r\nmonies he accepted from our neighbors to help feed and clothe the fugitives. It\r\nwas not beneath Father to mix ingredients like that; despite all, he was still\r\nunaccountably optimistic when it came to financial matters. But in early July, he\r\nsent Salmon and Oliver over the mountains to the lake to retrieve the beast, and\r\nsoon it had become a source of much pride and the occasion for his traveling\r\nabout the settlement in the attempt to improve the stock of his friends and\r\nneighbors.\r\nThus, except for my brothers, who watched me go out late and come back in\r\nthe early pre-dawn hours, my nighttime prowls went largely unnoticed by the\r\nfamily and, in a significant sense, unnoticed by me as well. My brothers teased\r\nme some, privately, for they suspected that I was secretly courting one of the\r\nmaidens in the settlement, but they did not otherwise speak of it.\r\nThen in August, like most of the farm families of the region, we took ourselves,\r\nour best produce and manufactured items, and our finest livestock down to the\r\nEssex County Fair, in Westport. We loaded the wagon with jugs of maple syrup,\r\nMary’s and Ruth’s quilts, blankets made from the wool of our sheep, willow reed\r\nbaskets and fishing weirs, tanned hides, and various leather items the boys had\r\nmade during the winter—wallets, purses, sheaths for knives, belts, harnesses,\r\nand, a specialty of Oliver’s, plaited bullwhips.",
    " Father made up a small,\r\nhandpicked herd of merino sheep, together with his finest red Devon heifer and\r\nthe widely admired new bull, and off we went—a triumphant return to\r\nWestport, as it were, proof that our spiritual errand into the wilderness, despite\r\nour reputation as non-farming, abolitionist troublemakers, had turned out an\r\nagricultural success, too.\r\nFather rode at the front on his fine sorrel mare, which later carried him all\r\nthrough the Kansas wars with great strength and courage. He loved that animal\r\nas he had no other and trusted no one not a family member to care for her and\r\ntrusted not even us to ride her. I drove the wagon, with Mary and Ruth beside\r\nme, the younger children all crammed in with our cargo, and the boys came\r\nalong behind with Father’s little herd of blooded stock, helped by our black\r\ncollie dogs, the type Father preferred over all others, despite their diminutive\r\nsize and their uselessness for hunting.\r\nWe arrived in mid-afternoon, in high excitement. There was a light off-shore\r\nbreeze, and in the east, across the glittering waters of the lake, a towering white\r\nbank of clouds rose from the softly rounded hills of Vermont into the bright blue\r\nsky, where it broke apart and scudded off in pieces to the south, leaving us here\r\non the western shore to bask in bright sunshine. It was the first agricultural fair\r\never held in the region, a visible sign that the northern wilderness of New York\r\nState had finally been settled and conquered by farmers. People came to it from\r\nall over the Adirondacks. They trekked in from their log and daub-and-wattle\r\ncabins in the furthest, most isolated valley and bog—squatters, grubstakers,\r\nminers, shag-bearded trappers and hunters dressed in the skins of their prey.",
    "\r\nMerchants and storekeepers, boatswains, blacksmiths, and coopers rode down in\r\ncarriages from the prosperous shoreline towns to the north, like Port Kent and\r\nPlattsburgh, or rode up from Port Henry and Ticonderoga or sailed across from\r\nShelburne and Charlotte in Vermont, readier to buy goods and livestock than to\r\nsell. The big dairy farmers and sheepmen rode in from their fifty-year-old farms\r\non the broad, rolling meadows of the older villages inland, like Elizabethtown,\r\nJay, and Keene, their wagons and carts stacked high with the fruits of the year’s\r\nlabor, touting their skills and bearing evidence of the generosity of the fertile\r\nLake Champlain and Au Sable River floodplains. From the newer outlying\r\nsettlements tucked up among the mountains, North Elba, Tupper Lake, and\r\nWilmington, came the poorer, hardscrabble farmers, folks like us and the\r\nThompsons and the Brewsters and the Nashes, recent settlers who were still\r\nchopping small fields out of the upland forests and had not much to show for it\r\nyet, although we Browns intended to give that the lie. Many of the citizens of\r\nTimbuctoo came over also, a two-day trek on foot, bearing on their backs and in\r\nwheelbarrows—for they had no wagons at that time and no draft animals—\r\ngarden produce to sell and exhibit in the halls, hams and maple syrup and candy\r\nand cheeses, packs of furs and hides, caged fowl, and a variety of crafted objects:\r\nreed baskets, woven hats, and prettily dyed cloth. There was even a small\r\nnumber of Indians, Abenakis and Micmacs, who had paddled down along the\r\nlake shore in canoes from their last remaining encampments, north of\r\nPlattsburgh, coming more out of curiosity, it seemed, than to exhibit wares or to\r\nbuy and sell livestock and farm goods, for they had none to sell and no money\r\nwith which to buy.",
    " Their abject poverty and loneliness were apparent to all, and\r\nthey seemed more like refugees in the land than its original masters, a people\r\nexiled without ever having left home. It was difficult to know how to feel\r\ntowards them, and so we tended to watch them in silence and from a distance\r\nand not to speak of them at all, even to one another.\r\nThis was the largest gathering of people that Mary and the children had seen\r\nsince leaving Springfield and the largest gathering of northcountry people that\r\nany of us had ever seen. Young men and women strolled hand-in-hand openly,\r\nand gangs of boys roughed each other up and organized teams for ball games\r\nand other sports, and girls walked demurely in pairs in their vicinity. Old folks\r\nand distant family members renewed connections with one another, while men\r\ncompared crops, animals, and prices and talked politics, and women set their\r\nsmallest children free to run and turned to one another in friendship and\r\ncheerful confidentiality.\r\nThere was a quarter-mile race track without a hoofprint on it yet and a white,\r\nfreshly painted grandstand ready to be filled that evening for the first time.\r\nBehind the grandstand were ten or twelve long, low barns for livestock, and\r\nbeyond the barns was a pair of fenced circles with stone boats, where ox and\r\nhorse-pulling contests were already under way. Beyond these were several large\r\nexhibition halls for showing and judging produce and crafts, and then rows of\r\nsmall, canvas-sided booths where shifty-eyed characters plied the crowd with\r\ngames of chance and sold cheap novelties and gew-gaws. Nearby, clouds of\r\nfragrant smoke poured from pit-fires where flocks of chickens were grilled and\r\nwhole hogs roasted on spits and potatoes and unshucked ears of corn cooked in\r\nthe ashes.",
    "\r\nWe registered our livestock and installed them in the barns and pitched our\r\ncamp alongside several other families from North Elba, in a grove of low pines\r\ndirectly behind the sheep barn, and in short order we all separated from one\r\nanother, each to follow his or her particular interest. Father headed straight for\r\nthe sheep barn and, of course, very soon found himself lecturing on the proper\r\ncare of sheep and wool to anyone willing to listen, a sizeable number of farmers\r\nand sheepmen, in fact, who had on their own gathered around the box-stalls\r\nwhere he had installed his merinos, for the large, healthy, heavy-fleeced animals\r\nwere an excellent advertisement of Father’s skills and knowledge. Ruth went off\r\nin search of Henry Thompson, who was not at his family’s camp; Mary and the\r\ngirls, Annie and Sarah, disappeared in the direction of the exhibition halls; and\r\nthe boys, Watson, Salmon, and Oliver, raced away with a gang of young fellows\r\nfrom North Elba, leaving me to wander the fairgrounds alone.\r\nI saw her almost at once. I had lingered in the sheep barn, listening to the Old\r\nMan hold forth for a few moments, and then, when I caught myself saying his\r\nsentences silently ahead of him, had drifted away, and as I passed out of the low\r\nshed and made my way towards the booths on the midway—suddenly, there she\r\nwas. She was a considerable distance away but glinting brightly in the crowd,\r\nlike gold in gravel, outside one of the exhibition halls—she was the only Negro\r\nin a group of white women and girls that included my stepmother, Mary, and\r\nsisters Annie and Sarah. Susan’s pale gray bonnet hid her face from my view, but\r\nI knew instantly, from her posture and the precise tilt of her head and the easy\r\ngestures of her hands, that it was she, and my heart leapt up.",
    "\r\nShe and Mary talked together for a few minutes longer, and then Mary\r\nembraced her and, with the other girls and women, drew away and strolled\r\ninside the hall, leaving her to stand alone outside with a characteristically\r\nbemused expression on her face. She was wearing a red and white plaid dress,\r\nwhich I recognized as one that Ruth had given her last winter, and carried a\r\nwicker basket, over which she had draped her shawl. For a moment, she seemed\r\nunsure of which direction to go, but finally she turned to her left and made her\r\nway towards the fairway.\r\nI followed at a discreet distance, until she turned into a narrow, shaded space\r\nbetween the second and third exhibition halls. No one else was there, and I\r\nquickened my pace and came up behind her and said her name.\r\nShe turned abruptly, her dark eyes open wide, frightened to see a man\r\nsuddenly this close to her, for I had come to within a few feet of her before\r\nspeaking. Then she recognized me, and the fear left her face, replaced at once by\r\na heaviness—a sadness, as I saw it, which produced in me a corresponding\r\nsadness and made me wish to embrace her, but I withheld myself and in a\r\ntrembling voice said that I was happy to see her.\r\n“It’s been a long while, Mister Brown,” she answered. “I was pleased to see\r\nyour mother looking so strong again. And Annie and little Sarah.”\r\n“Yes. We all miss you, Susan.”\r\n“Well. That’s nice, Mister Brown. Thank you.”\r\nWe made light, nervous conversation for a few moments, asking after each\r\nother’s health, speaking of the weather, the surprising size of the fairgrounds,\r\nthe great number of people, and so on—until I suddenly heard myself blurt,\r\n“Susan, I must tell you, Susan, that in his heart my father has replaced me. He’s\r\nreplaced me with Lyman.”\r\n“What... what do you mean?”\r\n“I bear Lyman no resentment for this, but it’s hurt me, Susan.",
    "”\r\nShe appeared shocked and said that it could not be true. “You shouldn’t be\r\nenvious of Lyman. He loves and admires your father over all other men,” she\r\nsaid. “But you, you’re your father’s son, Mister Brown. And your father, he loves\r\nyou for that, I know. More than he can ever love Lyman.”\r\n“No! You don’t understand. You see, Lyman is more important to him than I\r\nam. And with good reason.”\r\nShe sighed heavily. “What are you wanting me to say to you, Mister Brown?”\r\nI was silent for a moment. Finally, I said, “Please, just tell me why you’ve\r\nmoved away from us.”\r\nFor the first time, she shifted her eyes away from mine. “Well, I explained it to\r\nyour mother and your sister back then, back when we first decided. It was due to\r\nLyman wanting to farm his own land and to live in his own house. That’s all. We\r\nbeen with you all for a long time.”\r\n“No, not Lyman! I know why he left, and I know the real reason, too! I’m the\r\ncause of that. No, I want you to tell me why you left us.”\r\n“It’s very simple, Mister Brown. I went where my husband said. That’s the\r\nwhole of it. And you’re not the cause of anything Lyman done, Mister Brown,”\r\nshe declared. Then she lifted herself to her full height and said, “This is not a\r\nright conversation for us to be having.”\r\n“Yes, it is, because we need to talk. I need you to hear me. Even though you’ll\r\ndespise me, because it’s ... it’s a sin for me to feel for you as I do, and I have no\r\nright to say anything about it to you, because—”\r\nShe placed her hand gently on my arm and stopped me. “Mister Brown, please,\r\nsir, I know you’re a decent man. You are. But you are all mixed up” she\r\ndeclared, looking straight at me. “I’m saying this to you, Mister Brown, because I\r\nlike you, I truly do, and I know you don’t mean me no harm.",
    " But Lyman, he told\r\nme what happened last winter between you and him, when you come back from\r\nall your travels to England and you beat on him out there in the barn that day.\r\nSo I know things, Mister Brown. Maybe more even than Lyman knows, since he\r\nis a man and is a little mixed up about these same things, too. But I’ve watched\r\nyou, Mister Brown, and felt sorry for you, because I can see that you are all\r\nconfused and mixed up and angered. Maybe due to your father. Who is a strong,\r\ngood man doing good works, and he believes that he needs your help, so he\r\nwon’t send you off from him. Mainly that, I think. That, and us being coloreds\r\nand you wanting to help our people like you do. It’s the two things. They make\r\nyou think about Lyman too much, which is how you come now to be thinking\r\nabout me too much.”\r\n“No;’ I said. “It’s not that. None of it.”\r\n“Just stop that now! Stop. I’m not angry with you, Mister Brown, because I\r\nknow you don’t mean any harm. But I’m a colored woman, and my husband is a\r\ncolored man. And we wouldn’t be having this conversation, you know, not a\r\nword of it, if my husband and I was white people.”\r\nI stepped back from her. “Yes. You’re right. Please, then, please tell me what\r\nshould I do.”\r\n“Do? Not for me to say, Mister Brown,” she said tenderly. “I know you want to\r\nbe natural and peaceful and respectful with colored folks. But if you can’t, well,\r\nmaybe you should stick to your own kind. Lots of good folks, white and colored\r\nalike, that’s what they do. Go away from your father and live amongst white\r\npeople. Why not go out there to Ohio, Mister Brown, where your other brothers\r\nare, and find yourself a wife and settle down with her?”\r\n“A white woman.”\r\n“Well, yes.”\r\nFor a long time, I said nothing. Then I whispered, “I can’t do that.” She smiled\r\nat me, but as if from a great height.",
    " “Well, Mister Brown, then I don’t know what\r\nyou can do,” she said. And, abruptly, she turned her back and walked away.\r\nChapter 15\r\n“You ain’t half the man your father is.”\r\nThe words came without warning, and they chilled my blood. They do even\r\nnow, more than a half-century later. They were true then; they are true now.\r\nThe first time I heard them, they were uttered by Lyman; but after that, from\r\nthen on, they were said to me in my own voice, the sentence dripping into my\r\near like slow poison. You ain’t half the man your father is. To silence them, I\r\nwould, again and again, for years, be obliged to rouse myself into a fury, a literal\r\nblood-letting, making of my whole body a visible and tangible shout. For as long\r\nas my shout reverberated in the air, I would not hear them.\r\nYou ain’t half the man your father is. And who was he? Twice the man I was,\r\nand twice the man he seemed. And yet not half himself, either. Before Kansas,\r\nthe Old Man had always been larger than his reputation; after Kansas, he was\r\nsmaller. Although, over time, he himself changed not a whit. I changed,\r\ncertainly, and nearly everyone else changed. But not Father. Merely, his\r\nreputation caught up to the reality and then surpassed it, so that the man who,\r\noutside the family, had been known as a somewhat peculiar radical abolitionist\r\nwith a violent temperament, a somber activist with a huge reservoir of religious\r\nenthusiasm, a wild fellow who, despite his vague, crack-brained plan for a slave\r\ninsurrection, was nonetheless oddly trusted by influential and otherwise rational\r\nNegroes and was likewise understandably mistrusted by most whites—that man\r\ncame over time to be known as a heroic guerilla leader, a courageous and\r\nbrilliant military man who feared only God and had no other ambition than to\r\nbring slavery to an end.",
    " He came quickly to be known as a magnificent fighter\r\non horseback, an inspiration and example to lesser men, which is to say, to all\r\ndecent, anti-slavery white men: for none of them, no matter how thoroughly he\r\nloathed slavery and loved his Negro brethren, in his loathing and love was as\r\npure as Captain John Brown, as clear-eyed as he, as unequivocal and\r\nuncompromised as he. So that when my father-Father, the Old Man, Mister\r\nBrown, Citizen John Brown—got himself turned into Captain John Brown, it was\r\nnot merely a military rank that had been added to his name but an honorific,\r\nand the rank, as if he had been given it at birth, instantly became an integral\r\npart of his name, permanently attached to his identity, like that of Governor\r\nBradford, Admiral Nelson, Chief Tecumseh.\r\nIn North Elba, though, and to Lyman Epps especially, Father was known\r\nentirely for what he was—known more clearly for that to Lyman than even to\r\nme. So when Lyman told me I was not half that, he downright shriveled me. He\r\nstruck my manhood away and left me standing before him a child. Worse than a\r\nchild: a failed adult.\r\nMost men secretly know that there lies hidden inside them the boy they once\r\nwere and believe they still are, and all the work a man does in his life is\r\naccompanied by various stratagems designed to keep that child hidden from\r\nview. From his own view, especially. But that night in late summer at Indian\r\nPass, which lies yonder in the darkness seven miles to the south of our old\r\nfarmhouse, when Lyman raised his lip and sneered and then declared that I was\r\nnot half the man my father was, he made it impossible for me ever after to hide\r\nmy true self from my false self.",
    " It was as if, that night in the cave, Lyman were\r\nthe only man alive who could testify as to both my true character and the true\r\ncharacter of my father: he was our sole shared character witness and, thus, was\r\nthe only man capable of making the comparison between me and Father and\r\nmaking it stick.\r\nI don’t know why this was so. Lyman knew us both well, of course, intimately,\r\ndomestically, out in the fields, and on the Railroad running slaves north; for\r\nseveral years, he had observed both Father and me more closely than had\r\nanyone else who was not a family member. But that was not it. The truth is, I\r\nmade Lyman the authoritative witness myself; I myself validated his testimony.\r\nAs instructed by the Old Man, Lyman and I had been three days and nights down\r\nalong Indian Pass, cutting a trail wide enough for a man on horseback to get\r\nthrough to North Elba from the old Tahawus mining camp. Father would be\r\naway that September, once again—this time, as usual, for the last time, he hoped\r\n—settling his besieged financial affairs with Mr. Perkins, and he had charged the\r\ntwo of us with this task before leaving. The Underground Railroad station at\r\nTimbuctoo, with its links south to Tahawus and north to Canada, was the one\r\nsegment of Father’s Subterranean Passway that he felt he could control, and he\r\nwished to make it a model and a beginning for the whole.",
    " He intended to make\r\nit off-limits at pain of death for slave-catchers, man-stealers, and bounty-hunters,\r\nso that once he had made this small segment of the Railroad secure, with armed\r\nmen posted at the passes and gorges and up on strategic ridges, with fortified\r\nresting places and storehouses along the way, and with only the most trusted\r\nradical whites living in the farmlands below the Adirondacks allowed to provide\r\narms, provisions, and safe houses, he would begin extending the Passway\r\nsouthward into the Appalachians, mile by mile into the mountainous forests of\r\neastern Pennsylvania, until he came to western Maryland, where he would\r\ncommence his invasion of the enemy’s homeland itself. By this means we would\r\nbleed the South white, he declared. His fantasy for years; and then his dream;\r\nand finally his plan, too: now the three had at last coalesced, and he was\r\nbeginning in this small way in our very neighborhood to put all three, fantasy,\r\ndream, and plan, into action.\r\nAt the Tahawus mining camp, called the Upper Village, there was a new\r\nmanager, a man named Seybolt Johnson from Albany, replacing the previous\r\nsupervisor, the infamous Mr. Wilkinson. Mr. Johnson was a genuine abolitionist,\r\nfaithful and true, who had worked the Underground Railroad for years out of\r\nAlbany and Troy. With the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, he, like so many\r\nothers, had sought alternative routes north for the escaping slaves, and as he was\r\na longtime employee of the Adirondack Mining Company’s main office, in\r\nAlbany, he knew, even before he assumed the position of manager of the\r\nTahawus mines, that he could play an important role in aiding the Underground\r\nRailroad out there in the wilderness.",
    " Which he had done, for on his arrival at the\r\nUpper Village, he at once contacted Father and quickly arranged to regularize\r\nthe passage of escaped slaves from towns and cities south of Albany to the Upper\r\nVillage mining camp and on through the northwoods to Timbuctoo, North Elba,\r\nPaul Smith’s famous hunting lodge, Massena, and Canada.\r\nFather trusted Mr. Johnson, mainly because Frederick Douglass and Harriet\r\nTubman trusted him, but also because, immediately upon his arrival at Tahawus,\r\nMr. Johnson had set about to improve the lot of his Irish workers, who had\r\nsuffered so terribly under the iron hand of the hypocritical Mr. Wilkinson. Mr.\r\nSeybolt Johnson was that rarity, a white man of the managerial class who felt\r\ntowards his workers and Negroes alike that there but for the grace of God went\r\nhe. “The man is a true Christian,” Father had pronounced after his first visit with\r\nhim. “We can work with him.”\r\nThus Lyman and I, with axes and crowbars, were sent out to bush the old\r\nfootpath through Indian Pass and make it into a proper trail. Starting at\r\nTimbuctoo, we worked from north to south and in three days had gotten nearly\r\nto the halfway point, about seven miles in from North Elba, with Mount Colden\r\non our right and, hovering above its shoulder, the huge, rocky chest and head of\r\nMount Mclntyre. Mount Marcy—or Tahawus, as we still called it, Cloudsplitter,\r\nthe old Indian name for the giant—was on our left, its great shadow permanently\r\ncast across the rocky bottom where we labored day after day and camped in a\r\nsweet-smelling balsam lean-to at night. Indian Pass was dangerous, rough\r\nground. A man or a horse could easily fall and break a leg or tumble from a\r\nledge into a rocky pit.",
    " The long, narrow defile was shaded in the daytime, and\r\ndown in the gorge between the mountains, the Northern Star was blocked out at\r\nnight, and moonlight rarely fell, and a man had to be able to trust the feel of the\r\ntrail under his feet in order to get through. It was all too easy to get lost there,\r\neven at midday, to wander inadvertently down a bear path or deer trail and soon\r\nbecome disoriented in the darkness and dense woods. People had been known to\r\ndisappear into these woods and starve or freeze to death, their picked bones\r\nfound years later by a lone hunter or trapper.\r\nThe pass itself was colder than the peaks and cliffs that towered above it, and\r\nin some places slubs of old, gray snow remained year-round. High, sheer walls of\r\nmossy rock rose up beside us and disappeared into the mists overhead, while\r\nbelow on the floor of the gorge we chopped, dug, and shoved, and when\r\nnecessary laid down narrow log bridges to cross the gills and brooks and the\r\npeaty muskegs that abounded there. We would finish one arduous task of\r\nclearing and move on to the next bend in the path and instantly come to a new\r\nobstacle—a fallen, primeval spruce tree six feet in circumference, a head-high\r\ntangle of thick, twisted roots, a mudslide, a wall of enormous boulders—which\r\nwe were obliged to cut or move aside when we could or, when we couldn’t,\r\ncarve a pathway through lesser trees or around smaller rocks. Our simple intent,\r\nour one thought and standard, was to make it possible for a horse or a string of\r\nhorses, by day or night in any season, to carry frightened, exhausted fugitives\r\nfrom slavery through to freedom. That thought drove and organized us, and as\r\nwe worked we talked of little else.\r\nAt night, though, lying back on our mattress of layered balsam boughs, with\r\nthe fire guttering out, we spoke of other things, naturally.",
    " Lyman and I had not\r\nbeen together like this for a long time, a sad time, which I regarded with\r\nconsiderable regret. But out here alone in the wilderness, as of old, we soon\r\nfound ourselves speaking our innermost thoughts to one another once again,\r\ntalking of our respective childhoods and early days, our hopes for the future, and\r\nour beliefs regarding all first things. Our lives in every way were significantly\r\ndifferent, but in a paradoxical way, this let us know all the better how we\r\nourselves might have lived, had Lyman been born white and I black. Despite our\r\ndifferences, Lyman and I regarded ourselves, except for race, as remarkably\r\nsimilar, the way that lovers often do.\r\nThis is a complicated and painful recognition for a black and a white man to\r\nmake. On both sides, envy and anger get confusedly mingled with love and trust.\r\nAnd so it was with us. Or at least with me. I now knew, for instance, that my\r\nthwarted love for Susan was my love for Lyman gone all wrong, fatally\r\ncorrupted by guilt and envy. I did not want to love her—I did not love her at all\r\n—so much as I wanted to neutralize my powerful feelings for Lyman. For they\r\nhad frightened me: they were unnatural; they were the unavoidable consequence\r\nof a manly love finding itself locked inside a white maris racialist guilt, of Abel’s\r\nsweet, brotherly trust betrayed by Cain’s murderous envy.",
    "\r\nWe were on that third night out seated before our fire, after having eaten a\r\nsupper of trout pulled from a pool in the trickling beginnings of the Au Sable\r\nand potatoes carried in from home, and we were speculating on the nature of the\r\nearth before the arrival of the plants and animals—whether it had been a warm\r\nplanet, as some scientists were then claiming, or cold and covered with ice, as\r\nothers thought, or whether the Bible was to be believed in this matter in a literal\r\nway, when so many self-professed Christians nowadays, even including Father,\r\nregarded its description of God’s creation of the earth as figurative and\r\nallegorical.\r\n“Either way!’ Lyman said, “we know God created everything. The whole kit an’\r\ncaboodle. Question is, first time around, was it ice or was it fire? Did things heat\r\nup to get to where they are now, or cool down? With all that business about the\r\ndarkness and the firmaments between the firmaments, it must’ve been ice,” he\r\ndeclared. “I’m holding out for a world of ice that God sets to slowly melting over\r\nthe years, especially in the years since the birth of Jesus, as the Christian religion\r\ngets spread over the world. Starts way down in the Garden of Eden and moves\r\nout from there. Which is why the Bible comes from the desert anyhow. Egypt\r\nand all that. On account of it being close to Eden and it being already warm\r\nthere first.”\r\nLyman’s accent had slipped to the South, as it usually did when we were at\r\nease alone together and as I imagined it did when he was speaking only with\r\nblack people. He slurred his vowels, dropped consonants, and let his grammar\r\nfollow different, less logical rules and conventions than those that guided white\r\npeople’s grammar.",
    " When he talked this way, which was his natural speech, I was\r\noften inclined to let my own speech drift over in unconscious mimicry, for it was\r\nto me an attractive way to speak—smoother and slower, softer and more\r\nintimately expressive than my own habitual pronunciation and grammar\r\npermitted. I envied its intimacy especially and longed to escape from the\r\nformality of my accent and the impersonal logic of my sentences. But whenever I\r\nheard myself trying it, I grew severely embarrassed, as I could not speak Lyman’s\r\nEnglish without hearing myself in blackface. I felt like an inept imposter, an\r\nunskilled actor mouthing lines not his own.\r\nReluctantly, I would return at once to my accustomed manner of speaking,\r\nwhich had been influenced so profoundly by Father’s that, in the context created\r\nby Lyman’s fluency and ease, my words seemed to be coming from Father’s mind\r\nand my voice from his lips. Consequently, instead of sounding like an untalented\r\nminstrel showman making a mockery of Southern Negro speech, I sounded to\r\nmyself like a tinny, nervous imitation of my old-fashioned Yankee father.\r\nI have no idea of how I sounded to Lyman’s ears. If he envied the formality of\r\nmy pronunciation and the rigorous, constricting logic of my grammar, he\r\nshowed no signs of it. Merely, when amongst white people, he spoke in the\r\nmanner of a poor, uneducated Southern farmer who was white also, and since he\r\nwas, after all, a Southerner, it seemed authentic enough, at least to white people.\r\nPerhaps he was simply a better actor than I and could move from Negro to white\r\nspeech without exposing the gap between his true and false selves. I, it seemed,\r\ncould not, no matter how I spoke. Which is one reason why I so often chose to\r\nremain silent. Until now. When there is no one left to hear me but the dead, and\r\nyou, Miss Mayo.",
    "\r\nLyman said, “There’s still lots of places around here, even, where the old,\r\noriginal world ain’t got warm yet. So you can still see how it was back in them\r\nolden days, if you wants to. Got ‘em close by, even.” He told me then of an ice-\r\ncave located not a hundred rods from where we sat. There were a number of ice-\r\ncaves up here along Indian Pass, he said, which were known to the people of\r\nTimbuctoo and carefully avoided by them. “On account of them ol’ African\r\nsuperstitions an’ such. But they don’t bother me none. It’s older folks, mostly,\r\nwho is scared to go inside. They warns you off ‘em like the devil live there. Ain’t\r\nnobody live there. Too cold, ‘specially for the devil;’ he said with a short laugh.\r\n“You wants to see one?”\r\nI said sure, and we each stuck a pitchy pine-branch into the fire and, torches in\r\nhand, marched single-file into the darkness beyond our camp, moving uphill\r\nalong a rocky rivulet. Soon we approached the sheer, high walls of stone that\r\nmark the highest point of the pass, where the trickling waters split and half the\r\ntrickles run south and grow in time into the mighty Hudson and half run north\r\nand become the Au Sable and empty finally into the St. Lawrence. Here Lyman\r\nturned off the narrow path to his right and began to scramble uphill over\r\nriprapped rocks and tangled roots. I followed close behind.\r\nSuddenly, I felt a breath of cold air in my face, as if a huge, dead thing had\r\nexhaled. Lyman disappeared from my sight, and I thought the freezing breath of\r\nthe dying monster had blown his torch out, for all I saw before me was a clutch\r\nof low balsams and behind them the perpendicular face of the rock wall.\r\n“Lyman! Where are you?” I cried.\r\nHis voice came back all hollowed out: he was inside the cave. “Cup your torch,\r\nand come forward,” he said.",
    "\r\nI did as instructed, and the balsams easily parted, and in a second I found\r\nmyself gone from the familiar world of trees and mountain streams and purple-\r\nblue night sky. I was standing beside Lyman inside a high, rock-walled chamber\r\n—standing in the very mouth of the monster. Looking down its half-illuminated\r\nlength in the flickering light and leaping shadows, I could see the throat and\r\nbelly. It was as if we had been swallowed whole by Jonah’s whale. The chamber\r\nwas freezing cold and the air damp and still, and our warm breath blew pale\r\nclouds that lingered before our faces. There were long, white icicles hanging\r\nfrom the crackled sides and sharply angled top of the cave, and thick, yellowish\r\ntongues of ancient ice along the floor, dirtied and stained by the animals that\r\nover the years had wintered here—the old beasts: bears, catamounts, fisher cats.\r\nNo human could have stayed here long; it was too cold, too dark, too cruel a\r\nhabitation to visit, except briefly and only to escape blizzard, flood, or fire.\r\nThen the ice-cave was suddenly like a tomb to me, a stone sepulchre, and we\r\nwere locked inside it, as if a rockslide had sealed off the entry from the world\r\noutside. I imagined this but also for a moment believed it—that we two were\r\nactually trapped inside this cold, rock-walled chamber together, and no one\r\nknew. No one would come and dig us out. No one would ever find our bones or\r\nknow what had happened here. We had been at last cut loose from everything in\r\nthe world outside that had long separated us one from the other—the color of\r\nour skin, our war against slavery, Susan, Father. Even God! It was a vision that\r\npromised the end of solitude. I glimpsed in this moment the possibility of escape\r\nat last from my terrible isolation.",
    " The loneliness that had cursed me since\r\nchildhood and that had surrounded me like a caul seemed for the first time to\r\nstretch and extend itself like a pregnant woman’s belly to include another human\r\nbeing inside, who was a man like me, who was my twin, myself doubled and\r\nbeloved, and who was at this instant looking back at me with love.\r\nI reached down and shoved the unlit end of my torch into a notch between\r\ntwo rocks beside me so that it continued to burn. Then I drew out my knife and\r\nopened it and placed it into Lyman’s right hand and laid my right hand on his\r\nshoulder.\r\nHe looked at the knife and at me. “Why you givin’ me this?”\r\n“I have a confession to make.”\r\n“No,” he said in a low voice. “You don’t.”\r\n“Yes, I do. And I’m ready to die for it. But only at your hand.”\r\nHe snorted, derisively almost. “I don’t want no confession from you, Owen\r\nBrown. Whatever you done, you already done it anyhow.”\r\n“No. Not yet. My confession will be the act.”\r\n“Yes, you has. Ain’t nothin’ you confess to me I don’t already know. Susan told\r\nme how you spoke to her. An’ I seen you sneakin’ ‘round our cabin nights. And\r\nnow you wants me to forgive you for it? Or else to kill you?” He laughed. “No. I\r\nain’t gonna give you that, not neither one. You wants to kill yourself, now, that’s\r\ndifferent. Why not anyhow? Sneakin’ ’round after a colored woman, a married\r\nblack woman. Like she’s not as good as a white woman and deserving the same\r\nrespect? Or like I’m not as good as a white man? When here you is, the son of\r\nJohn Brown.” He curled his lip and stared me in the face. “You ain’t half the\r\nman your father is,” he said.\r\nHe handed the open knife back to me, turned, and left the cave for the world\r\noutside, while I dropped precipitously down a well of darkness, his words\r\nechoing in my ears as I tumbled and pitched and turned—descending into myself\r\nonce again: no-man.",
    "\r\nIn time, my torch flickered and finally went out and fell over, hissing like a\r\nsnake against the ice it had fallen on. I stood alone in the darkness and cold of\r\nthe cave like that for a very long while, before I stirred and groped along the\r\ngranite wall and found my way back out. By the time I stumbled back into our\r\ncamp below, Lyman had wrapped himself in his blanket and was asleep at the\r\nfurther end of our lean-to, or appeared to be. I drew my blanket around me and\r\ncurled up opposite him. But I did not sleep. Like a dead man, I lay with my eyes\r\nwide open, unblinking, staring at the night sky, with no words and no human\r\nvoice in my ears but the words and voice of Lyman’s terrible truth.\r\nFor the two days that followed, we worked in near silence, speaking to one\r\nanother politely but only when necessary, as we chopped trees and roots and\r\npried, rolled, and lugged stones off the path that led through the mountains to\r\nthe Tahawus mining camp. What was there now to say? It had already all been\r\nsaid—and Lyman’s final words to me in the ice-cave had permanently closed off\r\nany further conversational intimacies between us. I had not told him what by me\r\nstill wanted telling, but he had made it clear that whatever I might say, it\r\nneeded no hearing from him, and I could only accept that judgement.\r\nHard labor it was, then, made harder by the silent distance that stretched\r\nbetween us, and at night we fell back into our respective nests and dropped\r\nquickly into sleep. Days, it rained periodically and then cleared, and raggedy\r\nblue skies appeared overhead for a while, and then it rained again. For the most\r\npart, Lyman and I worked separately and as far from one another as possible.\r\nThe nights were cool, and a steady wind blew out of the southwest up along the\r\nnarrow defile, twitching the high pines and spruce trees into their raspy, long\r\nsong.",
    "\r\nWe were now well beyond the crest of the pass, and as we worked our way\r\nfurther along it, the burble of south-flowing rills and brooks soon became the\r\ncrash and thrum of a large stream—the Opalescent, which emptied into Lake\r\nColden below and then became the headwaters of the mighty Hudson. At night,\r\nwe heard the gruff cough of a bear, the distant howl of wolves, the dour call of\r\nthe owl, and at dawn the song of the whip-poor-will and the wood thrush, and\r\nthe raucous cries of ravens on the heights. But our human voices rarely joined\r\nthe forest chorus, rarely intruded on our private thoughts or broke our self-\r\nimposed solitudes.\r\nOn the morning of the third day following our visit to the ice-cave, we came\r\nout of the long, forested gorge onto the northern shore of Lake Colden, which\r\nstretched before us black and glittering in the sun. From the marshy shore on\r\nour right where the Opalescent emptied into the lake, a pair of loons rose like\r\nscratches on the sky and crossed overhead, disappearing into the spruce forest. A\r\nbroad grove of drowned trees spread along the further shore, standing like the\r\ngaunt pikes of a medieval army. For a while, we worked our way along the\r\nwestern shore of the oval lake, keeping to the high, dry ground amongst beeches\r\nand hickory trees, blazing the trees to mark the trail, and moving at a pretty\r\ngood clip, for the ground was relatively smooth now and there was not much\r\nheavy cover—ferns, briars, and hackberry thatch, mostly, due to its having been\r\nscorched a few years back by fire.\r\nBy midday, we were nearly past the lake and were about to re-enter the deep\r\nforest that for a mile or so of short ridges and gullies led gradually downhill to\r\nthe mining camp; we expected to finish our job and reach the camp by dark.",
    " It\r\nhad become our habit to stop at noon to rest and eat dried venison and apples\r\nand corn bread, gone stale by now, and Lyman, who had been working a few\r\nrods ahead of me, leaned his axe and crowbar against a birch tree and headed on\r\na line towards a narrow, flat rock that extended a ways into the lake. I put my\r\ntools and pack down and followed, not for companionship anymore, but because\r\nhis pack held our small stock of food.\r\nAlthough it was a seasonably cool day, the sun shone down brightly, and the\r\nsky was cloudless and stark blue, a taut blanket that stretched from horizon to\r\nhorizon. In a moment, I had caught up to Lyman, who was pushing his way\r\nthrough a chest-high thicket of willows. We were in a low, wet place and could\r\nsee but the tip of the rock just beyond the willows, and only now and then. I cut\r\nto his right, following what appeared to be an easier path to the rock, and when\r\nI came out of the thicket, Lyman was on my left and a few feet behind me. He\r\nwas still struggling to get through the willows. But when I turned and extended\r\nmy hand to help him, he had ceased moving altogether. On his sweating face\r\nwas sheer terror—as if he had seen Satan or God.\r\nI turned slowly around, moving just my head, and saw what terrified him, and\r\nit terrified me as well—a long, tawny-gray mountain lion backed up to the edge\r\nof the rock, with nothing but the glittering lake behind it and dark water on both\r\nsides and we two puny humans in front. The lion had been surprised by our\r\nsudden, upwind approach, and now it no doubt believed itself trapped by the\r\nwater and by us. The animal was no more than ten feet from me, its great tail\r\nswitching like a snake. Its shoulders were hunched low and its hindquarters\r\nlower, coiled to spring.",
    " Its small, feline head was nearly all mouth, as if it had\r\nbeen split in half by a hatchet, with black lips and tongue and enormous fangs.\r\nI had never seen a mountain lion alive this close, although with Watson I had\r\ntracked and shot two the previous year up on Mclntyre.\r\nI was as fascinated and thrilled by its fierce beauty as frightened of it. I had no\r\nweapon, other than the pocketknife I had pathetically proffered to Lyman back\r\nin the ice-cave. But I knew that Lyman had his pistol in his rucksack. I stood\r\nsquarely between him and the lion and had a much better shot at it than he. And\r\nI was the better marksman anyhow, and was even to some degree famous for it,\r\nwhile Lyman was equally famous for his inaccuracy.\r\nI showed him my open hand, and with extreme delicacy and without taking\r\nhis eyes off the beast, he drew the pistol out and extended it to me. Moving\r\nslowly and keeping my eyes fixed on the huge cat’s yellow eyes, I took the butt\r\nof the gun into my right hand, squared my body, and laid the barrel across my\r\nleft forearm, which due to the old injury was as steady as a window sill and\r\naccounted in no small degree for my good marksmanship. Lifting my forearm, I\r\naimed at the lion’s pale brow, at the top of the inverted V mid-point between its\r\neyes. I thought I could smell the lion. I remember, as I drew back the hammer\r\nwith my thumb, inhaling deeply—rotten apples—when, without warning, at the\r\nlast possible second for it to flee, the lion sprang from the rock. It crossed\r\nthrough the air some eight or ten feet to our left and towards the shore, its\r\nforepaws reaching the gravelly bank with ease, its hind paws barely touching the\r\nwater, and was gone into the brush. It crashed away in the distance for a few\r\nseconds more, and then silence. Not even birdsong.\r\nSlowly, I exhaled and at once began to tremble. My legs went all watery.",
    " I was\r\nglad, truly glad, and relieved that it had escaped. Seen this close, the animal was\r\ntoo beautiful to wish dead. I was not altogether sure I could have killed it with\r\nthe pistol anyhow, for I would have had but one shot, and the lion, a large male,\r\nappeared to weigh close to two hundred pounds and, wounded, would have been\r\neven more dangerous than when merely startled and inadvertently trapped on its\r\npeninsula. Still trembling, I stepped up onto the rock and sat down on the spot of\r\nbright sunshine where the lion had been taking its solitary leisure a few\r\nmoments before and handed the pistol up to Lyman, who had followed me.\r\n“That was the biggest lion I ever seen,” he said in a low, amazed voice, to\r\nwhich I merely nodded. “Don’t know who was more surprised, though, him or\r\nus. Never come up on one like that before,” he said. He was holding the pistol at\r\nhis side, and I looked at it and suddenly realized that I had neglected to let the\r\nhammer down—the pistol was still cocked. Hair-triggered. If he mishandled it,\r\nthe pistol would fire.\r\nI stared up into his narrow, dark, closed face: he was thinking not of the gun in\r\nhis hand but of the lion, I saw—the beautiful, powerful, ferocious mountain lion,\r\nan animal from another world than ours, a beast controlled and driven, from its\r\nfirst breath to its last, by hungers and fears that Lyman and I had been privy to\r\nonly in the most terrible moments of our lives. We could not forget those\r\nmoments; the lion could not distinguish them from any other. The beast’s\r\nsudden, long leap from the rock across water to land had been extraordinarily\r\nbeautiful and at once familiar and strange, like the best, last line of a beloved\r\nhymn, a graceful arc from bright, certain death to the dark, impenetrable\r\nmystery of the forest. Why could I not make that same leap?",
    " From my place out\r\nthere on the back of the rough, gray rock, I peered across the water to the\r\nthicket of willows at the shore and the trees beyond, up the beech- and hickory-\r\ncovered slope to the spruces and the tangled heights and rocky parapets above,\r\nwhere I imagined the lion now, moving in solitude freely and safely all day and\r\nnight, tracking down its prey and suddenly leaping upon it, pulling it to the\r\nground with its great weight and the brutal fury of its attack, rolling it over in\r\nthe soft, rust-colored pine needles, and burying its hungry mouth in the body.\r\nI heard the explosion of the gun and was not startled by it. I looked up at\r\nLyman. For a split second, he understood everything. Then his astonished, yet\r\nutterly comprehending gaze turned blank and flat as stone, and a huge, red\r\nblossom erupted in the center of his chest. His mouth filled with blood and\r\nspilled it, and he pitched forward headfirst. His forehead, when it hit the rock,\r\nmade an evil crack, like the snap of a dry stick.\r\nHe rolled over once onto his back, and the upper half of his body slipped off\r\nthe rock into the water of the lake. A cloud of blood spread from the hole in his\r\nchest and grew large in the water and quickly surrounded him, enveloping his\r\nchest, shoulders, arms, and head entirely, like the billowing masses of a woman’s\r\nsilken, scarlet hair.\r\nThe human body is a sac filled with blood—puncture its skin, and the shape\r\nand color of the body are grotesquely re-arranged and changed. It’s no longer\r\nhuman, its skin is no longer white or black. Half in the lake and bathed in the\r\nspreading swirls of his own blood, Lyman could have been a white man or a\r\nblack—there was no way to tell which. Blood is red.\r\nBut I was the man who had never been able to forget that Lyman, while he\r\nlived, was black. Thus, until this moment, I had never truly loved him.",
    " He was a\r\ndead man now—finally, a man of no race. And as surely as if I had pulled the\r\ntrigger myself, I was the man, the white man, who, because of Lyman’s color and\r\nmine, had killed him. It was as if there had been no other way for me to love\r\nhim.\r\nThere was nothing for love, now, but all-out war against the slavers. My nature\r\nwas fully formed; and it was a killer’s. And only by cleaving strictly to Father’s\r\npath would I be kept from killing men who did not deserve to die. Father would\r\nbe my North Star. Lyman Epps would be my memory of slavery.\r\nWhen Lyman was slain by the accidental firing of his own pistol—reported as\r\nsuch by me and believed at once by all—I did not know that four months later\r\nhis grieving widow would give birth to his son. I deprived Lyman of that, too.\r\nSusan would name the infant after his father, and he would grow up to become\r\nfamous in later years as a singer of religious songs. At the time of his birth,\r\nhowever, I was long gone—following Father’s instructions to gather up Fred in\r\nOhio. The younger Lyman Epps, the man who, because of me, was born and\r\nraised fatherless, I saw and heard sing on the day of the interment ceremonies\r\nbelow Father’s rock. His sweet voice rose into the cold May sky like the pealing\r\nof a bell as he sang “Blow, Ye Trumpets, Blow” over the box that contained the\r\nbones of eleven men and should have contained my bones, too.\r\nA terrible irony that would have been, had my bones joined those others. His\r\nsplendid voice honors my burial, without his knowing that, by my refusal that\r\nlong-ago day at Lake Colden to save his father, I was his father’s murderer.\r\nAlthough I told the truth then, when his father died, and I have told the truth\r\nnow, these many years later, the one was a lie, this other a confession.",
    " For the\r\none was told to the living by a man struggling to stay alive, a man still ignorant\r\nof his true motivations and weakness; and this other was told to the dead by a\r\nghost wishing solely to join them.\r\nThe story of how his father died, when his mother finally conveyed it to him,\r\nsurely must have cut the boy’s heart, leaving him scarred and wary all the years\r\nof his life. It was necessarily the story that I myself told to Father and to the\r\nmanager of the Tahawus mining camp and that they in turn told to others.\r\nAccompanied by a pair of fugitives-two strong young men led by Harriet\r\nTubman herself off a North Carolina plantation and brought out from Albany by\r\nFather—they came up towards the pass searching for Lyman and me, after we\r\nhad not turned up at the camp at the appointed time, for they needed us to\r\nconvey these fugitives on to Canada. At the lake, they found Lyman’s body\r\nwhere it had fallen, bled gray in the water, and me they found on the rocky\r\nheights above, howling like a wounded animal, with no memory of how I got\r\nthere.\r\nI had cut my crippled arm up and down its rigid length with my knife and had\r\nsmeared my face with blood and had rolled in dirt and leaves. Father calmed me\r\nand, holding me in his arms, managed after a while to extract from me a\r\ndescription of what had occurred, and finally led me back down from the crag to\r\nthe lakeside, where the others had constructed a litter to transport Lyman’s body\r\nhome to Timbuctoo.\r\nFather explained that he was obliged to return that day to Albany for one of\r\nhis court appearances, and Mr. Seybolt Johnson could not be away from the\r\nmining camp, so I and the two frightened young fugitives were pressed into\r\ncarrying Lyman’s body back along the trail we had just cut through the pass to\r\nTimbuctoo.",
    "\r\n“When you’re back there, let Watson deliver Lyman’s body to his wife, and let\r\nhim then carry these fellows on to Massena and the crossing to Canada,” Father\r\ninstructed, speaking to me as if I were a child and taking care also to write his\r\norders on the back of an envelope, which I was to place in Watson’s hand as\r\nsoon as we arrived at the farm. I was then to leave at once for Ohio, he said, to\r\nretrieve Fred, who had been too long alone. It had been several months since\r\nJohn and Jason went off to Kansas with their wives and little sons and put up\r\ntheir homesteads there.\r\nFather placed his hands on my shoulders and in a soft voice said that he\r\nthought I was too shaken to stay in North Elba now and needed some time away.\r\nHe perceived the depths and power and the true nature of my feelings, if not\r\ntheir source, and I believe that for the first time he was afraid for my sanity,\r\nafraid that if I stayed in North Elba close to the Negroes and especially to\r\nLyman’s widow, I would try to take my own life. He was right.\r\nThe true story of Lyman’s death, however, my confession, Lyman’s son never\r\nheard, man or boy, and has not heard now and never will, unless, when he\r\nhimself dies, he comes over to our old farmhouse and family burying ground and\r\nfinds me still talking into the darkness—the mad ghost of Owen Brown, he who\r\nwas the murderer of the elder Lyman Epps, he who was the secret villain of the\r\nmassacre at Pottawatomie, the meticulous arranger of the martyrdom of John\r\nBrown, and the cause of the wasted deaths of all those others whose bodies lie\r\nnow before me.\r\nThe younger Lyman Epps will not end up buried here; his bones will molder\r\nnext to his father’s and mother’s, three miles yonder in the old Negro burial\r\nground of Timbuctoo. And if he learns the truth of why his father died, he will\r\nhear it from his father, the only man who knows it as well as I.",
    "\r\nBut does my beloved, murdered friend Lyman speak on into the night over\r\nthere, as I do here? Impossible. Unlike me, Lyman died with a clean conscience.\r\nThus he surely went instantly silent.\r\nIV\r\nChapter 16\r\nThat was the year of the terrible Ohio drought, when the hay burned in the\r\nfields, and the soil crumbled into dust and was blown into dunes, and so many\r\nfarmers, especially the younger ones, were pulling up stakes and heading for the\r\nwestern territories to start over again. From Pennsylvania to Michigan, crops\r\nfailed before they blossomed, and the fields lay fallow, and the cattle and the\r\nswine were killed and butchered early to keep them from starving to death. Men\r\nand women looked out at their parched fields and up at the clear, blue sky and\r\nshook their heads and said, Enough! We’ll go where there’s rain falling. And my\r\nbrothers John and Jason and their young wives were among them that year.\r\nIt was the year that the copperhead Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, the\r\ndrunken Yankee minion of the slaveholders, became President, putting an\r\nessentially Southern, pro-slave government finally in place and setting up\r\npassage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which would turn an old-fashioned land\r\ngrab into a holy war. It overthrew the Missouri Compromise and transformed the\r\nold western frontier, making it for all practical purposes into a foreign land,\r\nwhich in that year began to be fought over by the people of two distinct,\r\nbordering nations, the slaveholding South and the free North.\r\nBy converting the western territories into an object of conquest, the Kansas-\r\nNebraska Act split the country more effectively than any of the battles and wars\r\nthat followed. The North and the South competing for Kansas in the 1850s were\r\nlike France and England at war over Canada a century earlier. Except that in\r\nKansas the stakes were higher.",
    " Every American knew that if the pro-slavers\r\ncaptured the territory, they would at once make it a slaveholding state in a\r\ndemocratic union that would be governed from Washington by a slaveholding\r\nmajority of the states, and as a direct result, three million Americans and their\r\ndescendants would remain permanently enslaved. The North, hopelessly a\r\nminority, would have no choice then but to secede from the Union or commence\r\na war of liberation against the South.\r\nAnd would white Americans go to war to liberate black Americans?\r\nUnthinkable. At that time, before Harpers Ferry, with no real blood yet spilt in\r\nthe name of the cause, the North would have merely shrugged and turned its\r\nback on the slaves and the Southern states altogether, and in a businesslike\r\nmanner would have looked northward for expansion and marched into Canada.\r\nIt was also the year of the birth of Father’s last child, Ellen, named for the\r\nbaby who had died in Springfield back in ’48. With the birth of this child, the\r\nOld Man had fathered on two women a total of twenty children. Of the twenty,\r\nonly eleven were to live beyond childhood; and of those, three more would die\r\nin their youth, cut down in the war against slavery; which left, from the eldest,\r\nJohn, born in 1821, to the youngest, Ellen, born thirty-two years later, only eight\r\nwho survived into adulthood.\r\nIt was the year that Lyman Epps and I finished our elaborate dance, and I went\r\nhowling into the wilderness, leaving wreckage and smoldering ruin all around\r\nbehind me.\r\nAnd it was the year that I followed Father’s orders and went out to Ohio to put\r\nmy brother Fred under my control and bring him back to the farm in North Elba,\r\nalthough in the end I did not bring him back.",
    " Instead, I disobeyed Father and\r\ntook him with me to Kansas, following my brothers John and Jason into the\r\nbattle there, and eventually by my actions forcing Father to do the same. It did\r\nnot seem that way at the time, of course, but it does now.\r\nIt was autumn when I arrived in Ohio, and the drought had ended some months\r\nearlier, but the effects of its devastation were still all around, many empty,\r\nabandoned farms and storefronts and fields gone back to brush and weed—as if\r\nthe landscape had recently been visited by a Biblical chastizement. It was like\r\nthat for me, too. That warm October evening at Mr. Perkins’s large, prosperous\r\nfarm a few miles outside Akron, with all the turmoil and madness of North Elba\r\nonly a few weeks behind me, I was still trembling and distracted by\r\nconsiderations of my own recent proximity to murder and perversion. Otherwise,\r\nI might have been more astute in my dealings with Fred, whose nervous\r\ncondition was, in fact, far worse than mine. I would have put my mission to him\r\nin a gentler way.\r\nUnlike me, however, he seemed on the surface to be at relative peace with\r\nhimself—sitting out with Mr. Perkins’s flocks of merino sheep all day long like\r\nan ancient shepherd with his crook and pipe, rounding them up at day’s end\r\nwith his little black collie dog, and returning them at nightfall to the fold.\r\nEvenings, he retired to a small hut that he had built of cast-off lumber, where he\r\nprepared his modest meals over a tin stove and read by candlelight from his\r\nBible and slept on a reed mat on the floor. In my agitated state, I envied him for\r\nthe monkish simplicity of his life and thus did not see the turbulence it hid and\r\nanticipated nothing of what was coming.\r\nThough not a large man, Fred was sinewy and tough and very strong, like\r\nFather.",
    " His face also resembled Father’s, with a hawk-beak nose and deep-set\r\ngray eyes under a heavy brow. His hair was stiff and straight, more brown than\r\nred, and he had grown a scruffy, wild beard. The last time I saw him, he’d been\r\na boy—not a normal boy, to be sure, but more child than man. All that had\r\nchanged considerably in the years between. I was not so much shocked or\r\nworried by the changes, because Father and my older brothers had prepared me,\r\nas I was intrigued by them. With his dark, leathered skin, he looked like a man\r\nof the desert, a bedouin or an ancient anchorite living on locusts and honey, an\r\neffect emphasized by his clothing—loose deerskin trousers held up by a length of\r\nrope, and a shearling vest with no blouse beneath it, and rough, Indian-style\r\nmoccasins which he had evidently made himself. Artlessly, but all the more\r\nartful for that, Fred cut an impressive figure.\r\nWhen I got to the Perkins place, it was nearly evening. A stable-hand pointed\r\nme to Fred’s hut, adjacent to the sheepfolds out behind the large white\r\nfarmhouse, and I went straight there, intending to visit with Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPerkins the next day and inform them of my intention to take my younger\r\nbrother away with me. I wasn’t especially eager to see them. Father was\r\nsupposed to have written them of my mission, so I anticipated no trouble, but I\r\ndid not particularly like Mr. Perkins and his wife. Despite his many years of\r\ngenerosity to Father, I somehow blamed Mr. Perkins for Father’s financial\r\ntroubles. I saw him, at little cost or risk to himself, as having offered the Old\r\nMan the opportunity to develop his wild financial notions unimpeded until he\r\nhad been overthrown by them. In the normal course of events, Father never\r\nwould have gotten his warehousing scheme off the ground. But Mr.",
    " Perkins was\r\na very rich man, a banker who had made a fortune in the canal business and\r\nspeculation in the early ’40’s land-boom, which had bankrupted Father, and for\r\nhim, the sheep business was only a distraction of his old age, a game played with\r\nidle money that allowed him to feel like a country squire and attend to\r\nsomething other than his many physical ailments. And I think Father’s skills as a\r\nbreeder of merino sheep and his energy, earnestness, and honesty fascinated Mr.\r\nPerkins, who was in all these ways the opposite. Also, he knew that, however\r\nmuch of his money Father lost in the wool business, Old Brown would pay Mr.\r\nPerkins back, no matter how long it took. Meanwhile, he had the continuing\r\nbenefit of having at least one of Brown’s sons to tend his flocks, which gave him\r\nan indentured, highly skilled worker with no fixed term, a hostage, almost a\r\nslave. Insensitive to these distinctions and similarities, the man was also\r\ndefinitely not an abolitionist, and Mrs. Perkins even less so, and we had long ago\r\nbeen instructed by Father, of all people, not to discuss or preach abolitionism\r\naround them. From the Book of Proverbs, he counseled us, “Better a dry morsel\r\nand quietness therewith, than a house full of sacrifices with strife.”\r\nBut, happily, his relationship with Mr. Perkins was at last drawing to a close,\r\nhe explained, and he no longer felt obliged to keep one or more of his sons\r\ntending the man’s flocks. More pointedly, however, the Old Man was alarmed.\r\n“Fred’s been showing some wildness,” he said, brought on, he assumed, by\r\nJohn’s and Jason’s leaving to go down into Kansas without him. So I was\r\ndispatched out to Ohio in order to “handle” Fred, as Father put it, and bring him\r\nhome. With one remaining suit to be heard at trial, which would require him to\r\ngo to Pittsburgh to defend himself and Mr.",
    " Perkins into the fall, Father,\r\nfollowing the tragedy at Lake Colden, instructed me to depart from North Elba at\r\nonce.\r\nHe wasn’t inventing this errand out of whole cloth just to get me away from\r\nTimbuctoo for a spell, although that was a benefit. Simply, the Old Man couldn’t\r\nleave Fred unattended in Ohio much longer, and he did not wish to have him\r\nplaced as far from his personal supervision as Kansas. In Kansas at that time, the\r\npro-slavery Border Ruffians were already pouring into the Territory from\r\nMissouri, with an equal number of Free-Soilers heading down from the North,\r\nand both sides were spoiling for a fight. But Father had no intentions of going\r\nout there himself, not even for cheap, abundant land and for an honorable fight.\r\nHe had land in New York, and his warrior’s mind was still on Virginia and the\r\nSubterranean Passway. If he was going to fight the slavers anywhere, he insisted,\r\nit would be there.\r\nIn July, he had written to John, No, if you two boys and your wives and children\r\nmust go, fine, do so. I’d go with you, if I could, but I can’t. You’ll just have to leave\r\nFred temporarily alone at the Perkins place, until I can figure a way to get him home\r\nhere in North Elba. Father thought it too dangerous in Kansas for Fred, who\r\nturned twenty-four that year and, according to John and Jason, had grown\r\nincreasingly morbid and subject to unmanageable bouts of melancholia, which\r\nwere often followed by inexplicable rages. His melancholy, I remembered from\r\nwhen he was in his teens, was a kind of heavy affectlessness and lassitude,\r\ndriven, it seemed, by delusory convictions of his own sinfulness, which, after a\r\nperiod, shifted into a state of wild intolerance of the presumed sins of others.",
    " He,\r\nthe most innocent of boys, the most trusting and honest, the most childlike,\r\ncould not reside inside his body without despising it, and when he could find\r\nnothing more in himself capable of sustaining this loathing, he turned it onto the\r\nreal and imagined sins of others, becoming suspicious, mistrustful, and wary.\r\nUp to now, in Akron, the dark effects of his seizures had been mostly\r\noverlooked by John and Jason and their wives, not without some difficulty,\r\nhowever. But tending the flocks of Brown & Perkins (of Mr. Perkins alone,\r\nactually, now that the company had been officially dissolved), with or without\r\nJohn and Jason to watch over him, Fred was nonetheless in familiar territory,\r\nsurrounded by neighbors and relatives who had known and liked him since\r\nchildhood and who would not exploit or abuse him or take particular offense\r\nfrom his delusions. That was just Fred, people said. Sometimes he was worse,\r\nsometimes he was better; either way, everyone who knew him knew also that he\r\nwas basically harmless.\r\nWhen I first came up on him, he was drawing water from the well, and he heard\r\nme and turned and spoke to me in his old, slow way, as if we had never been\r\napart and I had merely gone to the house for a moment and was now returned.\r\n“I believe it’s time to wash,” he said. “D’ ye want a drink of water first, Owen?\r\nYou look like you could use it, brother.” He picked up a wooden ladle from the\r\nlip of the well and dipped it into the bucket and extended it to me.\r\nI thanked him and drank. He was perfectly right, I was dry, and at that\r\nmoment, although I had not known it, preferred a cool drink of water to just\r\nabout anything else. Refreshed, I set down the ladle and grinned and laid my\r\nhands on his shoulders and said how good it was to see him, as indeed it was.",
    " I\r\nloved Fred—we had been boys together, and I had loved him and had felt\r\nprotective and custodial towards him long before I was conscious of there being\r\nany basic difference between us. We shared the same mother, he and I, and had\r\nmarched off to school together, and had played and then worked alongside one\r\nanother for years. I knew the shape of his eye, his inner face, better than that of\r\nany other human being, except perhaps Father’s, and what you have once known\r\nso well you must love always.\r\nTogether we lugged water back to his hut, where we washed off the day’s\r\nsweat and dust, his from the fields and mine from the road, all the while talking\r\nin our old, laconic way. He was in adulthood like my childhood imaginary\r\nfriend, his namesake, had been. It was only in Fred’s company that I did not feel\r\ntongue-tied and conversationally inept and thus could speak in the manner that\r\nfelt natural to me. Freed of my usual vanity and fears of sounding dull-witted,\r\nill-educated, and rural, I could speak slowly and obliquely, and by indirection\r\nsay and find true direction out. In speech, Fred and I were both oxen, but unlike\r\nme, he was an ox who never tried running with the horses. He drew his load of\r\nthought and feeling at the same steady, slow pace and direction, regardless of\r\nwho accompanied him or whatever rocks, stumps, and gullies got in his path.\r\nOne by one, he asked after Mary and Ruth and the younger children in North\r\nElba, and I reported on each, honestly, if obliquely, for the direct truth about\r\neach could not be said without making a narrative the length of a novel. Mary is\r\nnursing Ellen, the new baby girl, I said, at her age more worn out by the\r\npregnancy than the birthing and glad that her other female children are now old\r\nenough to take her place in the kitchen.",
    " I told him that Ruth was living nearby\r\nbut was pretty much taken up with meeting her new husband’s needs, which I\r\ndescribed as complex if inconstant. Watson was in love with a religious girl, a\r\nMethodist, had gotten religion himself, and was building a mill, which he hoped\r\nwould make him rich. Salmon was improving the scruffy local apple trees with\r\ncuttings from trees from Connecticut, and Oliver, though barely fourteen years\r\nold, had gotten hot with antislavery fever and was running fugitives night and\r\nday, and when he was home he was usually asleep.\r\nAnd so on down the line I went, until I had made small portraits of everyone,\r\nexcept, of course, for Lyman and Susan, whom I did not mention and of whom\r\nhe did not ask. He knew about their presence in our life, naturally, but he had\r\nnever met them. To Fred, they were like so many of the Negroes who had briefly\r\nresided with us at one time or another over the years, invited in by Father for\r\nasylum or merely to rest during their long, dangerous journey out of slavery.\r\nThey were more the continuing context than the content of our lives, and since\r\nFred could safely assume that our context was unchanged, he did not need to ask\r\nafter it or be told.\r\nHe made the two of us a simple supper of cabbage soup and rivels, which was\r\nvery good with biscuits, and while we ate, he reported to me about the sheep,\r\nwhich he referred to as his sheep. Afterwards, we were silent for a longtime,\r\nuntil finally Fred pursed his lips thoughtfully and furrowed his brow and said,\r\n“Why’d you come all the way out from North Elba, Owen?”\r\n“Well, the truth is, the Old Man’s finished up his association with Mister\r\nPerkins,” I said.\r\n“Oh. That right?”\r\n“Yes. And he wants me to bring you back up there.”\r\n“He wants me to leave my sheep and go with you?”\r\n“Yep.",
    "”\r\n“Oh,” he said, as if it mattered not in the slightest to him where he went or\r\nwhy. He lit a tallow candle and stretched out on his pallet and opened his Bible\r\nand began to read in it.\r\nI sat by the stove on a three-legged stool, wondering how long it would take us\r\nto arrange properly for our departure from this place... if we would have to hang\r\naround until Mr. Perkins hired himself another shepherd ... if it would be\r\nadviseable for me to go on down to Hudson for a few days to visit with\r\nGrandfather and our other relatives... if John and Jason had left any of their\r\npossessions with Fred, or did they take everything to Kansas with them, and how\r\ndid one do that, transport so much so far ... just letting my mind drift idly, when\r\nsuddenly Fred shut his Bible and in a loud voice announced, “Owen, it’d be best\r\nif I didn’t go with you.”\r\n“Why do you think that?”\r\n“Well, the fact is, I carry within me a great many lusts. And so long as that is\r\ntrue, I do not care to place myself amongst other people,” he explained in his\r\nslow, careful way. “Especially amongst girls and women. Here in my cabin and\r\nout there in the fields alone, I ain’t so tempted as when I’m with other people.\r\nParticularly those of the feminine persuasion.” He opened his Bible again and\r\nread aloud: Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and\r\nenticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. And sin, when it is\r\nfinished, bringeth forth death. He leafed ahead to another passage, obviously\r\nmuch-read, and recited, Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed\r\nremaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. “You see, it’s\r\nbecause of my lust, Owen, that my seed doth not remaineth in me. I can’t keep it\r\ninside me. I am not yet born of God;’ he pronounced.\r\nI did not know what to say then.",
    " We both remained silent awhile, until finally\r\nI asked him, “Do you pray, Fred? Doesn’t that help some? You know, with\r\nkeeping the seed inside and all.”\r\n“Yes, I pray a heap. But it don’t do any good. It’s been better since the others\r\nleft, though. John and Jason and their families. Since then I’ve been able to\r\nmove out here and be by myself and have mostly holy thoughts. No, I ought to\r\nstay right here where I am, Owen. It’s for the best. I know that.”\r\n“Father won’t permit it” I said firmly. “C’m’on, Fred, you know if I go back\r\nwithout you, the Old Man’ll come hopping all the way out here to fetch you\r\nhimself. And he’ll be mad at us both then. Up there in the mountains, you’ll be\r\nfine. The Adirondacks is still a wilderness. You can build yourself a hut there as\r\nwell as here,” I told him, and gave him to understand that he’d be even more\r\nalone in North Elba than he was here in Akron.\r\n“No, Owen, that ain’t true. All the whole family’d be around me. It’s the way\r\nwe are. Remember, ‘Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his lust\r\nand enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when\r\nit is finished, bringeth forth death.’“\r\n“Come on, Fred, you’re sounding like the Old Man;’ I said. “Thumping yourself\r\non the head with the Bible. Ease up on yourself, brother. You’re the best of all of\r\nus.” Then I repeated Father’s charge to me and declared forcefully that we’d\r\nspeak to Mr. Perkins in the morning and make our arrangements to leave here as\r\nquickly as possible. “They need us back at the farm,” I said, lying a little. “Not\r\nout here tending Mister Perkins’s flocks and arguing theology and sin all night.”\r\nI asked him if he had a blanket I could sleep in.",
    " Silently, he rummaged\r\nthrough his few possessions and drew out an old gray woolen blanket, and when\r\nI saw the thing, I recognized it at once from our childhood—one of the blankets\r\nspun and woven in the New Richmond house by our mother long years ago. He\r\ntossed it over to me, and I clutched it close to my face and inhaled deeply and\r\ngrew dizzy with nostalgia. For a long moment, I kept it against my face,\r\ntraveling back years in time, whole decades, to the long, cold winter nights in\r\nthe house in the western Pennsylvania settlement, with me and my brothers and\r\nsister Ruth, all of us still innocent little children, huddled under our blankets in\r\nthe big rope-bed in the loft, while below us, Mother tended the fire and cooked\r\ntomorrow’s meals, and Father sat on his chair by the whale oil lamp and read\r\nfrom his books, and all the future was still as inviting to me as it was unknown.\r\nFinally, I stirred from my reverie and asked Fred, “How’d you come still to\r\nown one of these blankets?”\r\nHe didn’t answer. He just looked down at the packed dirt floor. “I’d have\r\nthought they were all lost or worn out by now. Did John give it to you?”\r\nIn stony silence, he blew out the candle and lay down on his pallet, his back to\r\nme, as if gone to sleep.\r\n“Shall we take it with us?” I asked him.\r\n“You can keep it, if you want” he murmured.\r\nI couldn’t accept it from him; it was too precious a gift. But deciding it best\r\nnow to leave him to his thoughts and, in fact, eager to be immersed in my own, I\r\nlay down on the packed dirt floor close to the stove, where I wrapped myself in\r\nthe sweet-smelling blanket, and swooning with freshened memories of Mother\r\nand our childhood home, I was soon asleep.\r\nWhile I slept, the terrible thing that Fred did to himself took place.",
    " Or, rather, he\r\ndetermined then to do it and had actually commenced, so that even though I was\r\nawake when it was done, I could not stop him. I thought it was the sound of an\r\nowl or a ground dove that had wakened me, a low, cooing noise coming from\r\noutside the hut, but when it persisted and brought me wholly out of sleep, I\r\nrealized that it was something else, some night creature that I could not name.\r\nLifting myself on my elbows, I saw that the door to the hut lay half-open, letting\r\nin long planks of moonlight. Fred’s cot was empty.\r\nThe cooing sound, Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo, I realized, was being made by Fred\r\noutside. But I couldn’t imagine what it signified, so I unraveled myself from my\r\nmother’s blanket and stood in stockinged feet and peered carefully out the door,\r\nas if afraid of what I would see there.\r\nHe had his back to me and stood some five or six paces from the hut, and from\r\nhis head-down posture, legs spread, both hands in front of him, I thought at first\r\nthat he was making water. His trousers were loosened and pulled down a ways.\r\nWhoo-hoo, whoo-hoo, he sang in a light voice, as if chanting a single pair of notes\r\nbroken from a tune that he could not get out of his mind. Then I saw the\r\nknifeblade flash in the moonlight, a cold, silver glint that he held like an icicle in\r\nhis right hand, saw it disappear and then re-appear streaked red, as he made a\r\nquick swipe across the front of him, as if he were facing the exposed belly of a\r\nram lamb held from behind by a second shepherd, the way we had done so\r\nmany hundreds of times for Father, who with that same swift, efficient stroke of\r\na knife castrated the poor animal, severing the scrotum and releasing the\r\ntesticles into his cupped hand.\r\nI shouted Fred’s name, but it was too late.",
    " As if to answer me, he made a\r\nchilling little bleat, his only cry, and he turned and showed me the terrible\r\nbreach he had made in himself. Blood spilled from the grisly wound and flowed\r\nin a thin skein down his bare legs onto the wet grass.\r\nHe hurled his testicles away into the willow thicket with great force, as if\r\nviolently casting out a demon. On his face he had an expression of wild pride, as\r\nif he had come to the end of a long, exhausting day and night of mortal combat\r\nand had triumphed over an ancient enemy and had castrated the corpse and now\r\nstood over it all bloodied. He seemed dazed, stunned by the totality of his\r\nvictory. It was as if, for a few seconds at least, the terrible pain of his wound had\r\nbeen erased by its very extremity and by the significance of its meaning.\r\nThen his wild, proud expression disappeared, and he was possessed by a\r\nsudden placidity—a great calm. I rushed forward and embraced him and\r\nbloodied myself in doing it. I never felt such a sadness as I felt then, for it was in\r\nboth of us. He relaxed in my embrace, and all the force seemed suddenly to go\r\nout of him. The insidious little pocketknife, for that is all it was, fell to the\r\nground, and his knees buckled, and he began to collapse. I lifted him in my arms\r\nas if he were a bale of wool and carried him back inside his hut, where I laid\r\nhim down on his cot and at once set about washing and dressing his wound.\r\nIt was a single, neat cut straight across the sac. He had a practiced, shepherd’s\r\nhand, which was lucky, for he had severed no big vein, and the bleeding,\r\nalthough bad, did not threaten his life and soon abated somewhat.",
    " This allowed\r\nme to wash his wound with water that I heated on his little iron stove and to\r\ndress it with strips of cloth torn from my shirt, wrapping him loosely about the\r\ngroin in such a way that he would be protected from infection and accidental\r\ninjury, and the healing could begin.\r\nIt would be several weeks before Fred could walk properly again and we could\r\ntake our leave, finally, of the Perkins place. I wrote Father at once and told him\r\nof the incident—better for him to learn of it first from me than anyone else, I\r\nfigured—although I feared that it might bring him hurrying out to Ohio, which I\r\ndid not particularly want, nor, I thought, did Fred. In my letter, minimizing the\r\ndegree of Fred’s injury, but admitting nonetheless that he had effectively gelded\r\nhimself, I reassured Father that I could nurse Fred back to health myself, and he\r\nevidently believed me, for he remained in Pittsburgh, while I stayed by Fred’s\r\nside. During the weeks that followed, I tended him day and night, as Father\r\nhimself would have done, and never left him alone, except for the few hours a\r\nday when I myself was obliged to watch Mr. Perkins’s sheep. Luckily, the collie\r\ndog was clever and needed little supervision, so it was not an onerous task to\r\ndouble as shepherd and nurse. Besides, when I informed Mr. Perkins that, as\r\nsoon as he was able to travel, I planned to take Fred away with me, he promptly\r\nfound himself a new shepherd boy from a family in town.\r\nRight up to the morning we departed from that place, Fred believed that we\r\nwere returning to North Elba, and I myself thought so, too. But then came that\r\nmisty, gray dawn when we slung our rifles and our small bundles of clothing,\r\nfood, and trail blankets over our shoulders and walked down the long driveway\r\nto the road that passed by the Perkins place.",
    " I had kept Mother’s blanket and\r\nviewed it now as mine from childhood and never spoke of it to Fred. It was my\r\ninheritance.\r\nWhen we reached the road, without a glance or a thought one way or the\r\nother, I turned southwest, instead of northeast, and Fred followed.\r\nFor a few moments, we walked along in silence. “Where’re we going?” Fred\r\nfinally asked.\r\n“Well, to Kansas, I guess.”\r\nA quarter of a mile further on, he spoke again. “Father wants us to go to the\r\nfarm in North Elba. That’s what you told me, Owen.”\r\n“Yes. But we’re needed more in Kansas.”\r\nThere was a long silence as he pondered this. Finally, “Why?”\r\n“To fight slavery there.”\r\nMore silence. Then, “Doing the Lord’s work?”\r\n“Right.”\r\n“Good. That’s real good.”\r\n“Yep.”\r\nA little further down the road, he said, “But what about Father? He won’t like\r\nthis, Owen.”\r\n“Maybe not, at least at first. But don’t worry, he’ll come along soon to Kansas\r\nhimself. He won’t let you and me and the boys do the Lord’s work, while he\r\nstays out east doing Mister Perkins’s. Anyhow, John says there’s going to be\r\nshooting in Kansas before long. That’ll bring the Old Man on. He hates it when\r\nhe can’t give us the order to fine,”I said, and laughed, and he laughed with me.\r\nSo on we went, walking and sometimes hitching rides on wagons, barges,\r\ncanal boats, moving slowly west and south into the territory of Kansas—a one-\r\narmed man and a gelded man, two wounded, penniless, motherless brothers\r\nmarching off to do the Lord’s work in the war against slavery. In this wide world\r\nthere was nothing better for us to do. There was nothing useful that anyone\r\nwanted us to do, except to stay home and take care of the place and the women,\r\nwhich neither of us wanted to do and neither could do properly, either.",
    " We had\r\nto be good for something, though: we were sons of John Brown, and we had\r\nlearned early in our lives that we did not deserve to live otherwise. So we were\r\ngoing off to Kansas to be good at killing. Our specialty would be killing men who\r\nwished to own other men.\r\nChapter 17\r\nAt first in Kansas was the waiting—waiting for the Old Man to bring us the new-\r\nstyle, breech-loading Sharps rifles and horses and winter gear for waging war\r\nagainst the Border Ruffians, waiting for Father to raise abundant funds and\r\nsupplies in Syracuse and Akron and decide to come out to Kansas after all—the\r\nsame as when, after Kansas, we waited out the winter in Iowa; and then, still\r\nlater, as when we huddled together in the cold, unlit upstairs room of the\r\nKennedy farmhouse outside Harpers Ferry and waited for Father to return\r\nempty-handed from his final, fateful meeting with Frederick Douglass, so that\r\nthe assault on the Ferry could begin at last. We were always waiting for Father\r\nin those days; and it was every time in the same, humiliating way—quarrelsome,\r\ndisgruntled, in confusion and disarray, incompetent, undisciplined, often\r\nphysically ill, and all our best intentions and his careful instructions gone\r\nsomehow weirdly awry, as if we secretly meant to sabotage him, we the loyal,\r\ndependent sons and followers of John Brown lying in our cots, cold and damp,\r\nscowling up at the ceiling or into the walls, filled with dread at the thought of\r\nthe Old Man’s arrival, and yet at the same time nearly giddy with impatience for\r\nhim to come and darken the portal with his familiar shape and lower his head\r\nand walk into the tent, there to kneel down by one of us, the sickest, always the\r\nsickest, whom Father could identify at a glance, and which was John at that time\r\nwhen the Old Man first arrived out there in Kansas at the pathetic encampment\r\nwe called Browns Station.",
    " My waiting, of course, was more colored by dread and\r\nimpatience even than that of my brothers, for, in coming out here with Fred, I\r\nhad disobeyed the Old Man and needed to know how he viewed me now.\r\nJohn had gone down with the ague, but it had gotten worse, and soon he was\r\ntaking short, shallow breaths, as if his lungs had gotten enflamed. Feverish and\r\nshivering, subject to visions and spurts of wild, incoherent speech, he had been\r\nsick for a month by the time Fred and I got there from Akron. We had taken the\r\nold river-route down the Ohio and up to St. Louis by the Missouri, and when we\r\ngot to Browns Station, we found John unable to eat and barely able to sip water,\r\ndespite the tireless, silent care of his wife, Wealthy. And it was not long before\r\nFred and I, too, lay wrapped in all our clothes and blankets in the cots on either\r\nside of John, whom we followed close behind in the degree of our sickness, I,\r\nlike him, with the ague, and Fred, weakened from our travels and still healing\r\nfrom his terrible wound, unable to act without being led by one of his brothers.\r\nNeither of us could provide leadership for him. Or perhaps, in our chilled\r\ndespondency, neither of us wished to. So he had simply imitated me, as if I were\r\nimitating John. And perhaps I was.\r\nIt was not yet the dead of winter, it was, in fact and by the calendar, still\r\nautumn, and the snow was not so bad as it would have been by now in North\r\nElba. Yet I had never felt so cold up there in the eastern mountains as out here\r\non the western plain. It was as if in Kansas the sun had gone out permanently.",
    "\r\nThe icy, relentless wind off the flat expanse of land blew day and night and froze\r\nour clothes and hair and the beards of the men and stiffened our faces and\r\nrubbed our hands raw and made our bones feel like iron and never ceased\r\nblowing against the tents, snapping them like sails in a hurricane, threatening all\r\nnight and day to tear the canvas from the poles and rip the guy-lines and stakes\r\nfrom the hardened ground and expose our poor, blanketed bodies to the low,\r\ngray western sky, as if they had been put out there by the Indians for the coyotes\r\nand vultures to devour and for the old Indian gods to receive into paradise.\r\nWas it true that I had not seen Jason and his wife, Ellen, for weeks? They\r\nseemed to have withdrawn permanently to their own tent, on their adjacent\r\nclaim, not physically ill, as we were, but demoralized, withdrawn, selfish, and\r\nstill stunned with seemingly endless grief over the death of their little boy,\r\nAustin, whose body they had been forced to bury and abandon back in Missouri.\r\nThey had crossed the river en route from Ohio in late summer, and during the\r\nbrief trespass upon a corner of the slaveholders’ evil land, as if under a curse,\r\nthey had lost their only child to cholera. The disease had slain half the\r\npassengers of the boat, and with the exception of poor Austin, all the victims\r\nwere Missouri Border Ruffians and their families coming across to Kansas to\r\nclaim the territory for slavery. Jason’s and Ellen’s beloved little boy had been\r\nsnagged by that rough justice and died, a compensatory price too high for them\r\nyet to comprehend.\r\nWhen John and Jason and their matched families decided to come out from\r\nOhio, after their farms had been ruined by the terrible drought of the previous\r\nyear, it was in search of new, cheap land, so as to start their lives over.",
    " But they\r\nalso came to wage war against the slavers and to capture the Kansas Territory\r\nfor the North. Thus it was both a rational, opportunistic thing to do—and there\r\nwere thousands like them from all over the North, doing it for no other reason—\r\nand one that glowed with abolitionist righteousness as well. This was the sort of\r\nventure that had always appealed to John, but it had the added benefit of\r\nallowing him, by emphasizing the moral aspects of the venture, to advertise it\r\neffectively to Jason, who had not been as quick to leave the dried remnants of\r\nhis Ohio orchards as was John to abandon his scorched, hardcake fields. So\r\nwhile Jason and Ellen had gone out willingly, they had not gone eagerly, and\r\nperhaps for that reason, the death of their son, Austin, and the need to abandon\r\nhis body in a shallow grave on a bluff overlooking the river in slaveholding\r\nMissouri had made the couple quickly bitter. And there was the painful, ever-\r\npresent fact that John and Wealthy had their little son, John, whom they called\r\nTonny, still with them. John’s and Wealthy’s good luck, then, might have\r\ncontributed, too, to the sourish relations that prevailed between the brothers and\r\ntheir wives when Fred and I first arrived at Browns Station, bedraggled, like a\r\ncouple of tramps, many months later.\r\nIn a flurry of letters to Father in North Elba and then to him in Pittsburgh and\r\nto me in Ohio while I was watching over Fred, John had written that, to survive\r\nthe surprisingly violent Kansas weather and the rapid influx of Border Ruffians\r\nfrom Missouri, he needed soldiers, cohorts, reinforcements; he wanted up-to-date\r\nweapons and cows and swine, blankets, grain, dried beef and salt fish: he was\r\nawaiting the arrival of the makings of an invading army.",
    " What he had got\r\ninstead was a pair of scrawny, exhausted refugees carrying no more than their\r\nblanket-rolls and their twenty-year-old muzzle-loaders. We must have been a\r\ndisappointing sight, Fred and I, that morning when we arrived at the camp, one\r\nof us blank-eyed and struck dumb by the enormity of his self-mutilation, still\r\nhitching himself along with a rough crutch, and the other, me, a nervy man with\r\na crippled arm glancing back over his shoulder with the wariness and guilt of a\r\ncriminal, our clothes shabby and dirty from our arduous journey, bringing to our\r\nbrothers in their place of brave settlement, this desolate place where they had\r\nchosen to make their permanent homes and take their self-defining stand against\r\nslavery, nothing but our craven needs for comfort and love.\r\nBut if we were disappointing to them, they and their settlement were just as\r\nmuch a let-down to us, for we saw, not the neat log cabins and lean-tos amongst\r\nthe cottonwood groves and broad, fresh streams and high, grassy meadows of\r\nKansas that we expected and that John had described to us in his letters. We saw\r\ninstead a pair of tattered, flapping tents, a single, broken-wheeled wagon, cold\r\nfirestoves outside, four bony horses nibbling at the frozen turf. And over all, a\r\npervasive gloom and lassitude—an atmosphere worsened by John’s illness and\r\nby Jason’s and Ellen’s withdrawal to the privacy of their own tent, which they\r\nhad pitched on their land claim several hundred yards down the draw from\r\nJohn’s and Wealthy’s towards the Osawatomie River.",
    "\r\nOn our arrival, Fred and I had visited and greeted them separately, as if they\r\nwere John’s jealous and unhappy neighbors, instead of his beloved younger\r\nbrother and sister-in-law sharing a calamity; afterwards, we had encamped up on\r\nthe ridge in John’s second tent, and that made Jason and Ellen think that we had\r\nchosen John and Wealthy over them. And when, in a few days, I fell sick myself,\r\nit was simpler for me to move in with John, where Wealthy could the more\r\neasily tend us both, and then Fred followed, perhaps because he knew not what\r\nelse to do and now hated being alone with his thoughts. He came into the tent\r\nand placed his bedroll on the other side of John, so that there were three of us\r\nlying there, crowded into a single small, dark space, whilst poor Wealthy tried to\r\nkeep the fire going outside, despite the wind and the snow and the lack of good,\r\ndry firewood, caring for us as if we had been shot and wounded in battle instead\r\nof having declined spiritually into a muck of despondency and sloth and after a\r\nwhile had weakened and got physically sick as well.\r\nWealthy had her poor, confused son, Tonny, beside her at every step, clinging\r\nto the folds of her dress and whimpering all day and night about the cold and\r\nfrom constant hunger and showing even then the first signs of slowness that\r\nwould later grow into retardation and cause her and John so much sadness and\r\nworry. But if she had not had him there, I believe that Wealthy would have\r\nwalked on one of those long winter nights straight into the darkness that\r\nsurrounded us then and disappeared, only to be found days later, frozen to death\r\nin some gully. For she was as angry then as any woman I have ever seen in my\r\nlife. She was silent, and she fumed. And with every good reason. John, Jason,\r\nFred, and I, we were all of us pitiful, shameful specimens of manhood.",
    " We were\r\nnot worthy of her; nor of Jason’s wife, either. Here we were, the four eldest sons\r\nof the great John Brown, four sickly, miserable fools, foundering in gloom, gone\r\nall weak and cowardly. I confess it, it was the women who were strong and they\r\nwho, to all intents and purposes, kept us alive, until the winter morning when\r\nthe Old Man finally arrived and began to set everything straight.\r\nAnd it happened just as I imagined it would. Just as I hoped and dreaded it\r\nwould. The tent flap was drawn suddenly away, and against a milk-white sky\r\nloomed the dark, familiar shape of Father in his broad-brimmed black hat and\r\nhis greatcoat. He entered the tent, glanced quickly around in that expressionless\r\nway of his when he has come upon something complicated and unfamiliar,\r\nsurveying the scene with as little emotion as possible, until he has acquired from\r\nit all the information necessary for a proper response, which in this case was to\r\ngo straight to John, who in his delirium and fever had neither seen nor heard the\r\nOld Man enter, whereas both Fred and I, like startled rabbits, had sat up at once.\r\nIn silence, the Old Man felt John’s forehead and then bent his head to his\r\neldest son’s chest and listened to his clotted lungs and his heart. Behind him I\r\nsaw shades flitting beyond the thin canvas, rough profiles of other people\r\nmoving about outside, and heard the creak and clank of saddles and harness and\r\nthe low voices of my brothers Salmon and Oliver, which surprised me, for I had\r\nthought Father was coming out alone, and I heard a male voice that I did not at\r\nfirst recognize, then the voices of the women, Wealthy and Ellen, and Jason, too,\r\nas if a crowd had gathered out there.\r\nIn a somber voice, Father said his first words to us: “We’ve got to place a fire\r\nin here and set a kettle of water to steaming and clear his lungs.",
    " I don’t suppose\r\nyou boys have any stovepipe handy, or you’d have already done that.”\r\nI shook my head no, and Father stood up and passed by me without saying\r\nanything more. For a second, he paused over Fred and looked down at him with\r\ngreat sadness. In a thin, apologetic voice, almost a child’s, Fred said, “It’s John\r\nand Owen who are sick, Father. Not me so much.”\r\n“Yes, I know. And I know about your injury, son. Owen wrote me of it. We’ll\r\nsit and have us a proper talk later,” was his response, and he went directly out.\r\nHe said nothing to me then of my having disobeyed him, nor did he speak of it\r\nafterwards. It was as if his silence on the subject were my punishment, for it did,\r\nindeed, feel like one.\r\nThings changed quickly then. Father set everyone to work at once—even me and\r\nFred. Even, in a sense, John, who was obliged, with Wealthy’s help, to change\r\nout of his filthy, damp clothing, and after washing himself from a basin of water\r\nheated on the fire that Salmon had quickly got blazing outside, he put on some\r\nof Salmon’s and Oliver’s extra garments, which were his size and, more\r\nimportantly, were dry and clean, and then Wealthy wrapped him in several of\r\nthe fresh blankets that Father had brought and propped him up in his cot, so that\r\nhis lungs could expand somewhat, Father said, and still following the Old Man’s\r\ninstructions, she shaved her husband’s scruffy beard and combed out his matted\r\nhair.\r\nFather gave few explanations; he merely gave orders, and then set to work\r\nhimself. “Jason, you and Salmon pack in from yonder grove of cottonwoods as\r\nmuch deadwood as you can find in an hour. Then start a greenwood smokefire\r\nand cut and dry us a few of those old oaks.\r\n“Ellen, you go on down to your stake there below and empty out your tent.\r\nFumigate and scrub it clean, air out all your blankets, and tighten those slack\r\nropes up a mite.",
    " And when you put your things back inside, leave the rear wall\r\nclear, as we’ll be setting a campstove there.\r\n“Wealthy, when you’ve finished shaving John, you do the same as Ellen with\r\nthese two tents up here. And why’n’t you put little Tonny to work right away at\r\ncarrying out as much as he can lift by himself? The lad needs to know he’s\r\nuseful.\r\n“Oliver, here’s the money and a list of items to purchase in town. Start now\r\nand be back before midday, so we can have our stoves set up by nightfall.\r\nUnload the wagon first, my boy, we’ll be needing some of those goods and tools\r\nright off’\r\nHe helped Oliver wrestle down a barrel of salt, another of corn meal, many\r\nnew gray woolen blankets, a large supply of dried Adirondack venison mixed\r\nwith berries, Indian-style, and axes, spades, half a dozen unmarked wooden\r\ncrates, and a pine box, carefully fitted and sanded smooth, which I thought\r\nmight contain rifles, for it was the right size and Father himself lifted it from the\r\nwagon and carried it with considerable delicacy to a knoll a short ways off,\r\nwhere he set it down on the ground and then for a short time stood motionless\r\nover it, as if in prayer, before returning to the encampment.\r\nTo my surprise and pleasure, besides having recruited Salmon and Oliver,\r\nFather had brought out from North Elba our neighbor and brother-in-law Henry\r\nThompson. Henry was the most fervent abolitionist of all the sixteen Thompson\r\nsons, a tall, strapping, young fellow who idolized Father. The Old Man instructed\r\nhim to begin at once building a proper corral for the horses, and he told me and\r\nFred to take ourselves off with him and give him what help we could.",
    " “A little\r\nmovement and fresh air will improve you,” he said, and we instantly complied,\r\nand of course he was right—in a short while, quite as if we had been able-bodied\r\nall along but merely had not known it, both Fred and I were cutting and\r\ndragging poles from down by the river up to a narrow defile close to the camp\r\nwhere Father had determined was the best location for a corral. Later on, by\r\nmidday, as ordered, Oliver returned from the town of Osawatomie with\r\nstovepipe and three tin campstoves, and Father promptly installed one in each\r\ntent, and when he and Oliver had them properly working, he sent Oliver off to\r\ncommence digging a proper privy and then turned to educating Wealthy as to\r\nthe best care and treatment of John, whose color, now that he was breathing\r\nmore easily, had already begun returning to his face.\r\nIn half a day, Father had turned Browns Station from a place of desolation into\r\na proper frontier settlement. The tents were tightened against the wind, and with\r\nsweet-smelling streams of woodsmoke flowing from their tin chimneys, they\r\nlooked secure and warm, even cheerful, situated in the protective crook of a\r\nnarrow, forested cut that switch-backed down a long, grassy decline to the\r\nmeandering river below. Spade and crowbar scraped against dirt and stone,\r\nhammers pounded stakes and drove nails, and axes and handsaws bit into wood,\r\nsending blond chips and sawdust flying. The air was filled with the bright clatter\r\nof leafless trees falling, of brothers calling to one another through the cold\r\nafternoon as the light began to fade—the sound of men happily at work, eager to\r\nfinish their tasks before dark.",
    " There were the startled neighs of horses suddenly\r\nreleased to pasture inside a temporary corral made with a rope strung between\r\ntrees, the bang and scrape of pots and pans being washed, the snap of wet\r\nlaundry hung to dry in the breeze, and someone down in the cottonwoods even\r\nbegan to sing—Salmon, I realized; of course, it would be Salmon, for he had the\r\nbest-pitched, clearest voice of us all and the sharpest memory for the old hymns\r\n—and first Father joined in with him, and then one by one the others picked it\r\nup, even Fred, even me.\r\nWho are these, like stars appearing,\r\nThese, before God’s throne who stand?\r\nEach a golden crown is wearing;\r\nWho are all this glorious hand?\r\nAlleluia! Hark, they sing,\r\nPraising loud their heavenly King!\r\nTowards evening, Oliver came marching proudly into camp with his old\r\nKentucky rifle in one hand and, in the other, four fat prairie chickens, low-flying\r\nground birds somewhat like our partridges, which he delivered over to Wealthy\r\nand Ellen, two to each woman. After praising the lad in such a way as to goad\r\nthe rest of us to go and do likewise every day from here on out—”For I have\r\nseen considerable game on our way here,” the Old Man said—he then bade us all\r\nto cease our labors now and follow him out to the knoll, where he had earlier\r\nlaid the mysterious pine box. Even John, with Salmon and Oliver half-carrying\r\nhim, was obliged to come out to the windy hilltop.\r\nNow, I thought, now each of us will be given his own Sharps rifle! I had come\r\nto despise my old muzzle-loader: it didn’t suit my fantasies or my intentions in\r\nthe least; it was a boy’s smooth-bore gun, suitable mainly for shooting birds and\r\nraccoons; I wanted a weapon that would let me slay men. I wanted one of the\r\nfamous new-style, breech-loading Sharps rifles that fired with deadly accuracy\r\nten times a minute.",
    " Manufactured in the armory at Harpers Ferry, they were the\r\nso-called Beecher’s Bibles which that winter had commenced appearing all over\r\nKansas in the hands of the more radical Free-Soilers. First sent out in crates\r\nmarked Bibles by the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher’s congregation in Brooklyn,\r\nNew York, they were being purchased and shipped to the Free-Soil settlers now\r\nby churches all over the East. I was sure Father would not have come out\r\nwithout at least one case of weapons from the Church of the Holy Rifles—he was\r\nnot in Kansas, after all, to farm.\r\nBut when we had all gathered there on the knoll, I saw that, sometime during\r\nthe day and without my having observed him, Father had dug a deep hole in the\r\nground next to the box, and for the first time I began to see that it was perhaps\r\nnot a crate of Sharps, but something else, for the box resembled nothing so much\r\nas a finely carpentered coffin. Father looked down the line of us and reached out\r\nand drew Jason and Ellen forward to the center, where he stood, so that the\r\nthree of them were now standing before the box, and at that I understood finally\r\nwhat was inside the box and why we were gathered out here.\r\nThe sky was darkening down in the east and cream-colored in the west, and\r\nthe chilled, late afternoon breeze blew into our faces. Without looking at any\r\none of us, staring instead down at the box before him, Father said, “Children,\r\nwhen I rode out from the east I carried with me a whole set of maps. A whole\r\npassel of maps, and overlapping they were, and one of’em, Jason, was sent to me\r\nby you, as you know. That was the very detailed map that led me to the grave\r\nthat you dug in slaveholding territory, where you wrapped in a blanket the body\r\nof your poor little boy, Austin, and buried him whose soul has now gone on to\r\nGod in heaven. But whose body lay buried in Missouri soil.",
    "\r\n“Among my other maps, Jason and Ellen, and above all of them, the master\r\nmap, as it were, is the one that guides them all—the map that is given to me by\r\nthe Bible. It is God Almighty’s plan of these United States, which I carry with me\r\nwherever I go, and on that map this Kansas Territory is still free and will remain\r\nfree so long as I draw breath. Children, I mean to lay those two maps over one\r\nanother, Jason’s very detailed drawing of where his child lies buried, and God’s\r\nequally detailed plan, and align them.” He then looked straight at Jason and\r\nEllen and said to them, “I know, my children, that you were surrounded by the\r\nenemy back there in Missouri and were afraid therefore and were maybe\r\nsomewhat confused as to what was fitting and proper. I don’t mean to scold or\r\nupbraid you, children, but I myself could not abandon that boy’s body in\r\nslaveholding territory.\r\n“I went there to my grandson’s grave, to pray over it, as you asked me to do,\r\nbut then, when I had completed my prayers for his soul, I realized that I could\r\nnot tolerate the thought of anyone with my blood and name lying under a little\r\nwooden cross in a potter’s field in a slave state. The very thought of it enraged\r\nme. So I retrieved Austin Brown’s body from that tainted ground, and Henry and\r\nI built it a proper coffin and placed it inside and put it into my wagon, and now\r\nwe have carried it here to Kansas, where men and women and children are not\r\nchattel, here to bury it properly, here to place and mark his gravesite on God’s\r\nmap of this land and not Satan’s!”\r\nThen, with the darkness coming slowly on, Father handed ropes to Henry\r\nThompson and me, which we draped beneath the pine box, and holding to them,\r\nwe lowered the coffin slowly into the earth. Jason and Ellen held each other and\r\nwept. Wept with grief, but I am afraid also with shame.",
    " For Father had shamed\r\nthem terribly with what he had done.\r\nWhen the box had gone down into the hole, we filled the hole with dirt and\r\nmoved from the gravesite one by one in a kind of confused browse, as if we were\r\nboth reluctant and eager to get away from it. Last to leave were Father and\r\nJason and Ellen, and I heard him say to them, “Tomorrow you will make a cross\r\nwith your boy’s name and dates on it. And you will set it at the head of the\r\ngrave, there,” he pronounced, and placed his foot firmly on the ground at the\r\nplace beneath which he knew the boy’s head lay. Directly, then, he departed\r\nfrom the knoll, leaving Jason and Ellen alone at the gravesite. Thus ended the\r\nharsh, sullen division between Jason and his Ellen and the rest of us. We were all\r\none family again.\r\nChapter 18\r\nAnd yet I felt, in a new, peculiar, or maybe just unfamiliar way, alone again. Not\r\nan isolato, as I am now, or merely lonely, as I had been before Kansas, but\r\nsolitary in the way of the devious Iago in the famous play about the Moor by\r\nWilliam Shakespeare. Iago is the man who remains, no matter how crowded the\r\nstage, incommunicado, unknown, locked inside himself as if inside a dungeon.\r\nAnd while, certainly, in all matters I did as Father wished, I nonetheless became\r\nunder him in Kansas, like Iago, my own man. Not Father’s. Father was my white-\r\nskinned Othello.\r\nWe did not go straight to war against the Border Ruffians. We could not, due\r\nto John’s lingering illness and the need to set our tattered, windblown camp\r\nstraight and make rudimentary householding possible. Also, at that time the\r\nBorder Ruffians were still holding their fire and were confronting us and our\r\nFree-Soil neighbors with little more than loud, drunken talk and empty threats.\r\nThe Kansas War was something that was happening mostly in the newspapers of\r\nthe Southern states and back East.",
    " And for a spell Father seemed more intent\r\nupon finding surveying work for himself than in leading us into battle against\r\nthe slavers, and consequently he spent a considerable amount of time away from\r\nBrowns Station, in Topeka and Lawrence and up on the Ottawa Reserve,\r\nsurveying town sites and claims and marking the borders of the Indian territory.\r\nIt was a good place and time to be a surveyor. There was much confusion and\r\ncontroversy then concerning the settlers’ claims and legal title to lands, thanks to\r\nthe rapid influx of impoverished squatters and the large-scale purchases of land\r\nby outside speculators like the New England Emigrant Aid Society, whose\r\nshareholders, despite their stated ambitions to settle Kansas with Free-Soilers\r\nand keep the West from becoming part of the Slavocracy, were in it to make a\r\nprofit and did not mind if they made it off Indian land, government land, or land\r\nclaimed by some poor grubstaker from Illinois with a single, sorry ox and a wife\r\nand five hungry children, a man too illiterate to register his claim properly.\r\nTo the east and south of Browns Station, the Southerners for months had been\r\npouring across the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers into the territory in ever\r\ngreater numbers than the Free-Soilers. Not three miles from us there were slaves\r\nowned. With the encouragement and connivance of their dough-faced President,\r\nFranklin Pierce, the pro-slavers had already elected themselves a bogus\r\nlegislature and governor situated in Leavenworth and had passed their\r\ndisgusting “black laws” which made it a crime to read and write or even think\r\nand speak as we Browns did every day of our lives, laws which we now took\r\nspecial pleasure in breaking every chance we got, not only to express our\r\ncontempt for them, but also to goad the Ruffians into trying to enforce their\r\nlaws, which, so far, they had been reluctant to do.",
    " We, of course, had few\r\ndealings with them, anyhow, and did business mostly with folks who were allied\r\nwith us, especially those who, like us, counted themselves radical abolitionists,\r\nat that time a distinct minority even amongst the Free-Soilers. Even so, most of\r\nour presumed allies, like most Northerners then, were as anti-Negro as they were\r\nanti-slavery: they wanted to keep Kansas soil free, all right, but free and white.\r\nTo them, slavery was little more than an unfair labor practice imported from the\r\nSouth.\r\nIn his capacity as surveyor, despite his politics and principles and his usual\r\ninability to keep them to himself, the Old Man nonetheless passed unimpeded\r\nthrough the lands controlled by the pro-slavers, for they were as eager as the\r\nFree-Soilers to ascertain the limits and extensions of their land-claims, certain as\r\nthey were then of outnumbering us and fearful, therefore, only of our\r\nencroaching on their lands illegitimately. Father was just the scrawny old\r\nYankee surveyor with his wagonload of instruments and lines traveling across\r\nthe plains of eastern Kansas looking for work.\r\nOnce again, as he had for a spell back in North Elba, the Old Man called\r\nhimself Shubel Morgan. The name of John Brown was pretty famous by now and\r\ndaily growing more so, especially out here, where he and his sons were known\r\nthese days to be armed with Sharps rifles and Colt revolvers. He had indeed, as\r\nI’d hoped, lugged out from Ohio two unmarked crates that turned out to be\r\npacked with weaponry, and he had distributed a Sharps and a Colt revolver and\r\na sharpened broadsword to each of us.",
    " All that winter into the spring, whenever\r\nwe rode into Osawatomie or up to Lawrence for supplies or to send mail and\r\nmessages east, we brandished our new weapons, like our politics and principles,\r\nwith unabashed pride, and soon all around the region John Brown and his sons\r\ncame to be regarded by both sides as potentially troublesome.\r\nAs the surveyor Shubel Morgan, however, and with his rifle and Colt and\r\nbroadsword tucked out of sight in the wagon box, Father was able to put himself\r\non friendly terms with most everyone he met. Thus did he quickly gain\r\nwonderful intelligence of the meandering rivers and sparkling creeks, the\r\ndensely wooded gullies, washes, ravines, and gorges that criss-crossed the vast,\r\ngrassy plains like the lines of a flattened hand. Also, he learned the names and\r\nlocations of the cabins of every pro-slave settler in the region and in short order\r\nknew them as well as the names and locations of the Free-Soil settlers. He\r\nobserved and tallied up the pro-slavers’ weaponry, too, and the number of horses\r\nthey had, and he discerned something of their general character, which he\r\nthought little of. “Cowards” he reported, “and drunkards. Illiterate, ignorant\r\nfools with no taste for a real fight, unless it’s over a woman or a jug of corn\r\nliquor.”\r\nThere was down on the Pottawatomie River, not far from Browns Station, a\r\nparticularly nettlesome settlement of Border Ruffians that Father liked to\r\ncomplain of, the Shermans, the Doyles, and the Wilkinsons, our nearest\r\nneighbors, in a sense, although to call them neighbors was a gift, for they\r\ndespised us as much as we them.",
    " They were landless farmers who’d drifted up\r\nfrom the Southern hillcountry and built tippy, dirt-floored cabins where they\r\nmade their babies—angry, poor, ignorant people who took their greatest\r\npleasure in puffing up their sense of their own worth by making drunken threats\r\nof violence against Northern abolitionists and against us Browns especially. So\r\nfar, they had not delivered on any of their threats, and none of us thought they\r\ncould stay sober long enough to carry it off.\r\nThere were not many Negro slaves in the region, half a hundred perhaps,\r\nrarely more than one or two attached to a single owner, as most of these pro-\r\nslavers, like our Pottawatomie neighbors, were failed, landless farmers come out\r\nfrom Tennessee and Missouri and parts of the deeper South, many of them\r\nwithout families, even, and with almost no livestock. And Father was right, there\r\nwas amongst all of them a surprisingly high proportion of reprobates, whiskey-\r\nsellers, thieves, prostitutes, tramps, gamblers, scamps, and other parasites who\r\nhad followed the Southern settlers as if they were a conquering army instead of a\r\nmigrating mob of ignorant farmers desperate for cheap land.\r\nIn fact, the motives of the pro-slavers for coming out to Kansas were no less\r\nmixed than those of us Free-Soilers: like us, they had come for land, for\r\npecuniary advancement, and to wage war over slavery, usually in that order.\r\nAnd, to be truthful, their wild, violent, racialist, and pro-slavery rhetoric was no\r\nmore incendiary than ours. The difference between the two sides was that,\r\nwhereas their rhetoric was Satan’s, ours was the Lord’s. They shrieked at us from\r\nSatan’s camp, and we trumpeted back from the Lord’s.\r\nThat is how Father saw it.",
    " We were not superior to the pro-slavers by virtue of\r\nour intrinsic morality or our intelligence or our farming and animal husbandry\r\nskills or our weapons or even our courage, he daily preached to us. No, we were\r\nmade superior solely by virtue of Him whom we had chosen to follow. The\r\nstinking darkness of institutionalized slavery had made the Southerners into a\r\nfoul and corrupt people. It had stolen their souls and had made them followers\r\nof Satan. For centuries, they had resided in a permanently darkened pit, and\r\nthus, to them, the world was a dimmed, low, pestilential place. We, however,\r\nwhen we gazed onto the world, we stood as if on a peak bathed in the bright\r\nlight of freedom, which enabled us to see the true nature of man, and therefore,\r\nsimply by following our own true nature, we were able to follow the Lord God\r\nAlmighty. And after much scrupulous examination, having confidently discerned\r\nthe Lord’s will, we naturally had determined to make all men and women free.\r\nIf, to accomplish that great task, we must put to death those who would oppose\r\nus, then so be it: it is the will of the Lord: and in this time and place, He hath no\r\ngreater work to set before His children than that they stamp upon the neck of\r\nSatan and crack the jaw of his followers and liberate all the white and black\r\nchildren of the Lord from the obscene stink and corruption of slavery. Simply, if\r\nwe would defeat Satan, we must first defeat his most heinous invention, which\r\nwas American Negro slavery.\r\nI believed this. All of us at Browns Station believed it, regardless of the\r\ndifferences amongst us regarding religion.",
    " In our little army of the Lord, John\r\nand Jason were positioned at one extreme, freethinkers, downright agnostical\r\nskeptics; and at the other were poor Fred, tormented by his visions of a\r\npunishing God who now spoke to him personally on a regular basis, and Father,\r\nwho appeared to believe that he himself was sometimes allowed to speak for\r\nGod; the rest of us fell in between the two extremes at various places, which felt\r\ntemporary, like stops for rest on a long journey. Nevertheless, every one of us,\r\neven the women, Wealthy and Ellen, and our brother-in-law Henry Thompson,\r\nbelieved that we were now about to devote our lives to the very best work we\r\ncould imagine, so that if God indeed existed, it was His work that we would be\r\ndoing here. And if God did not exist, then it did not matter. For, regardless of\r\nour differences, all of us believed in a law higher than any passed by a bogus or\r\neven an authentic and legal legislative body of men, and belief in that higher law\r\nrequired us to dedicate our lives to the overthrow of chattel slavery and\r\nracialism. And perhaps it was only chance that had placed us here in Kansas, or\r\nmaybe Father was right and it was in the end God’s will, but either way, here we\r\nwere, situated precisely where the battle could no longer be avoided, where the\r\nenemy had pitched his tent virtually in our very dooryard, and where we would\r\nbe obliged to rise up at last and slay him.\r\nMy older brothers saw that and trembled with fear or sadly anticipated grief.\r\nAlthough he accepted its inevitability, Jason, especially, did not want war. The\r\nman was preternaturally sensitive to the suffering of others and could barely\r\nwatch the slaughter of a hog, but even he no longer believed that there was a\r\nway to end slavery without killing people. He, more than any of the rest of us,\r\nhad originally come out to Kansas strictly to farm.",
    " He had even brought along\r\ncuttings from his Ohio vines and eight sapling fruit trees, and while the rest of us\r\nsharpened our swords and ran bullets for our revolvers and Sharps repeaters and\r\nattached bayonets to long poles, Jason merely watched with a terrible sadness in\r\nhis eyes, planted his vines and little trees in the newly thawed ground, and kept\r\nmostly to himself. His wife, Ellen, and John’s wife, Wealthy, were naturally as\r\nreluctant for us to go to war as was Jason, but the women, too, knew that it\r\ncould not be avoided now, unless the Lord Himself intervened, and there was no\r\nsign of that. They seemed to accept it as their fate, although Ellen was starting to\r\ntalk about returning to Ohio in the autumn, with or without Jason, if fighting\r\nbroke out.\r\nBrother John had always been an anti-slavery firebrand, certainly, but he was\r\nalso an ambitious, somewhat worldly man and still seemed to hold out hopes for\r\na political victory, as we would soon have in the territory a sufficient number of\r\nFree-Soilers to establish a legitimate Free-Soil legislature and governor of our\r\nown and pass an anti-slavery territorial constitution that would get Kansas\r\nadmitted to the Union as a free state. Well-spoken and more educated than the\r\nrest of us, John had it in his mind to get elected to the Free-Soil legislature in\r\nTopeka.",
    " There was a significant number of radical abolitionist settlers in and\r\naround Osawatomie and Lawrence who were eager to support him, and every\r\nday hundreds of Eastern radicals who honored the name of John Brown were\r\ncoming down into the territory by way of the new Iowa-Nebraska trail, settlers\r\nwho back home had regularly read The Liberator and The Atlantic Monthly and\r\nwould be proud to vote out here for the son and namesake of Old John Brown,\r\nthe famous abolitionist from New York State, friend and associate of the even\r\nmore famous abolitionists Gerrit Smith, Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, Dr. Samuel Howe, and Thomas Wentworth Higginson.\r\nSalmon and Oliver both were hot-blooded boys eager to test their mettle in a\r\ngood fight, and they had long ago grown used to following, if not Father himself,\r\nthen me. They were wholly reliable, therefore.\r\nThat left to constitute our little army only Henry Thompson and brother Fred.\r\nHenry was newly married to Ruth, his wife back in North Elba residing during\r\nhis absence with the Thompson clan, but despite that—because he believed in\r\nFather’s wisdom and moral clarity even more than Father’s natural sons did—if\r\nthe Old Man let him, Henry would follow him straight into the jaws of hell. And\r\nthen there was Fred, poor, wild Fred, whose dreams and visions seemed to have\r\nbecome so thoroughly intermingled with his daily reality that he thought we had\r\nalready gone to war against Satan: with Fred, the main difficulty for us lay in\r\nholding him in check until such time as we needed him to start firing his Colt\r\nand laying about with one of the terrible, ancient, double-edged broadswords\r\nthat Father had brought out with him from the East and which Fred wore\r\nstrapped to his waist day and night.\r\nIncluding myself, then, this was the core of John Brown’s little army of the\r\nLord.",
    " Before long, we would be joined at times by as many as fifty others, some\r\nof whom stayed on for the duration and followed the Old Man all the way to\r\nHarpers Ferry, some of whom weakened and fell away, especially after the news\r\nof what happened at Pottawatomie got around, and some of whom were slain in\r\nbattle. Father was our general, our commanding officer, our guide and\r\ninspiration, the man whose words chided and corrected us and gave us courage\r\nand direction, and without whose example we would have foundered from the\r\nstart.\r\nLeft to his own devices, however, the Old Man, once he had got our camp up\r\nand running again and had us properly armed and organized into a fighting\r\nforce, would have fallen back into his lifelong patterns of wait and see, of delay\r\nand discuss, of research and reconnoiter, of organizing his followers and enticing\r\nthem to war and then stepping away and leaving us to our devices—just as he\r\nhad done in Springfield with the Gileadites, just as he had done all along: for\r\nwhile Father was a genius at inspiring and organizing men to wage war, when it\r\ncame to leading them straight into battle, he needed someone else—he needed\r\nhis son Owen—at his ear. Action, action, action! may have been his constant cry;\r\nbut at crucial moments he needed someone else to whisper, Now! Until that\r\nspring in Kansas, he did not truly know this. Nor did I.\r\nIt began in a small way. While Father was off at the Ottawa Nation, making one\r\nof his interminable surveys, it happened that below us, down in Douglas County\r\non the far side of Dutch Sherman’s camp, a Free-Soil settler from Ohio named\r\nCharles Dow, a man whom John and Jason happened to have known back East,\r\nwas cutting timber for his cabin and got into a row with his nearest neighbor, a\r\npro-slaver from Virginia named Frank Coleman. The Virginian claimed that the\r\ntrees were his, not Mr.",
    " Dow’s, and shot and killed Mr. Dow in cold blood. A few\r\ndays passed, and when the Virginian was not arrested, John, who was now up\r\nand about and had begun active politicking, contacted Mr. Dow’s numerous\r\nFree-Soil friends and called for a protest meeting up in Lawrence. As Lawrence\r\nwas by then fully a Free-Soil redoubt, John and I and Henry Thompson expected\r\nno trouble and rode up for the meeting unarmed. It was the last time we did\r\nthat.\r\nJust south of Lawrence, we were met at the Wakarusa bridge by a large troop\r\nof heavily armed Border Ruffians, deputized and led by the sheriff of Douglas\r\nCounty, a pro-slave appointee named Samuel Jones. Without ceremony or\r\nexplanation, they put their guns on us and demanded to know our reasons for\r\ngoing into Lawrence. When John forthrightly said that we were going there to\r\nattend a meeting that he himself had called for the purpose of protesting the\r\nunpunished murder of Mr. Charles Dow, the sheriff promptly arrested him for\r\ndisturbing the peace and took him off at gunpoint towards Leavenworth.\r\nHenry and I galloped straight on to Lawrence, where we quickly rounded up a\r\nband of close to thirty men with Sharps rifles and rode out after the sheriff. We\r\nmanaged to throw down on him and his ragtag troop and their prisoner before\r\nthey crossed the Kansas River into slave territory. Wisely, they did not resist, and\r\nwe promptly took John away from them and rode in triumph back to town,\r\nwhere John and, to a lesser extent, Henry and I became instant celebrities.\r\nHumiliated and enraged by this act, the sheriff had ridden back to\r\nLeavenworth, where he informed the bogus governor Shannon that there was\r\nunder way in Lawrence an armed rebellion against the laws of the territory. At\r\nonce, the governor mobilized the Kansas militia and put it under the command\r\nof the slaveholding senator from Missouri, Hon.",
    " David Atchison, a drunkard,\r\nwho brought into his force the leaders of several other whiskeyed-up bands of\r\nBorder Ruffians, and loudly vowing to exterminate that nest of abolitionists, the\r\nwhole gang of them headed for Lawrence.\r\nWe learned this the day following our protest meeting, when we were riding\r\npeacefully back from Lawrence. Nearing Browns Station, we met up with a\r\nbreathless rider come from the Shawnee Mission over near the Missouri border,\r\na Free-Soil settler who had raced all the way to Douglas County to spread the\r\nalarm. He told us that more than two thousand Missourians and members of the\r\nKansas militia were taking up positions on the Wakarusa south of Lawrence, and\r\nthey intended to burn the town to the ground.\r\nAngered and alarmed, we rushed on to Browns Station to round up Father, our\r\nbrothers, and our weapons. When we arrived, we saw that Father had returned\r\nfrom the Ottawa Reserve and, unaware of what had transpired, was engaged in\r\npreparing to join us in Lawrence to protest the killing of the Ohioan Charles\r\nDow. Quickly, John related what had happened, and the Old Man, I remember,\r\nreacted with what seemed like delight.\r\n“It’s come, then,” he said, rubbing his hands together. “The time has come at\r\nlast.”\r\nFirst, however, we needed to run off another hundred bullets, he declared.\r\nDutifully, Salmon and Oliver set to work.\r\n“Father;’ said I, “the Border Ruffians very likely have already placed Lawrence\r\nunder siege. We must hurry.”\r\n“I know, I know. But our friends up there will need all the bullets we can\r\ncarry,” he replied, and instructed us to fasten our pikes with the bayonets\r\nattached to the sides of the wagon box, to affix them with the blades pointed to\r\nthe sky, so that we would impress the enemy with our machinery. An old Roman\r\nmilitary tactic, he explained.",
    "\r\n“Come on, Father, let’s just toss everything into the wagon and get on to\r\nLawrence now. We can do all this up there.”\r\nNo, he thought that we might have to fight our way into the town, since the\r\nRuffians had probably taken their position on the Wakarusa bridge, which lay\r\nbetween us and Lawrence. We would have to make all our preparations for\r\nbattle here and now, he declared.\r\nThen there were provisions to pack. The siege might last a long time, he\r\npointed out. And the broadswords wanted more sharpening. And then the wagon\r\nhad to be loaded with exquisite care so as not to damage any of the weapons,\r\nand so on, until finally it was dark, and we still had not left Browns Station.\r\nSince there was no moon that night, it was too dangerous, Father thought, to\r\ntravel up along the California Road to Lawrence with so many Missourians\r\nabout, for we did not want our weapons and horses to fall into the hands of the\r\nenemy, did we? We had better wait till morning, he decided.\r\nJohn slouched off towards his lean-to, frustrated and angry, although Wealthy\r\nwas not, and Jason was not, nor Ellen. Henry agreed with Father, of course, for\r\nno other reason than that Father had said it. Fred did whatever he was told, and\r\nSalmon and Oliver, gnashing their teeth, did, too, and followed the Old Man’s\r\norders to empty the wagon once again and re-balance the load.\r\nFinally, after having pondered the matter awhile, I moved in close to the Old\r\nMan and said to him, “Father, listen to me. If we do not go now, many good,\r\nslavery-hating men will die because of it. And the Lord needs those men alive,\r\nFather. Not dead.”\r\nSlowly, he turned and gazed into my eyes; I thought he was angry with me\r\nand would sharply condemn my words. But, instead, he settled both hands onto\r\nmy shoulders and sighed heavily, as if relieved of a great burden. In a low voice,\r\nhe said, “I thank thee, Owen.",
    " God bless thee. I’m not afraid of this enemy,” he\r\nsaid. “But I am too much afraid of leaving things to chance. It’s my old habit of\r\nprocrastination. I’m merely weak and don’t trust sufficiently in the Lord. Go and\r\nget the others, son. We’ll load the wagon and leave for Lawrence at once.”\r\nGetting up to Lawrence on a moonless night was not easy. It was a fifteen-mile\r\nride, and we were obliged to ford the Marais des Cygnes River and several lesser\r\ncreeks and then make our way over rough, pitted and gouged ground as we\r\ncrossed the southeast corner of the Ottawa Reserve, until we reached the\r\ndarkened cabin of the Indian trader Ottawa Jones and his white wife, where the\r\nCalifornia Road joined the Santa Fe Trail. From there, the route lay over mostly\r\nhigh, flat prairie on a trail that was little more than a track beaten into the thick,\r\nhigh-grass sod by the hundreds of westering wagons that had passed this way in\r\nthe last few years. The horses needed no guidance then, and we began to make\r\ngood time. Father was in the lead, up on his fine sorrel mare, Reliance, and\r\nOliver drove the heavily loaded wagon, our Roman war machine, which was\r\ndrawn by our old North Elba Morgans. John and Jason each rode their horses,\r\nbrought out with them from Ohio, but the rest of us, Salmon, Henry, Fred, and I,\r\nwalked behind the wagon.\r\nBy the time we crested the last rise before the Wakarusa River, a few miles\r\nsouth of Lawrence, it was nearly dawn, and in the pale, pinking light we could\r\nsee the encampment of the Border Ruffians spread out below—not thousands of\r\narmed men, as we had expected, but many hundreds, with dozens of fires\r\nburning. The entire force was in disarray, however, with no one on watch at the\r\nbridge or guarding their scattered horses.",
    " Large numbers of men appeared to be\r\ndrinking whiskey and carousing, while others slept in makeshift bedrolls or lay\r\nin heaps where they had fallen sometime during the night. A general debauch\r\nwas still going on, with discordant strains of fiddle music coming up the slope,\r\naccompanied by obscene shouts, bawdy songs, and occasional, random gunfire.\r\nWe held up in the shadows of a copse of cottonwood trees on the ridge above\r\nand for a long while studied them on the floodplain below. They did indeed look\r\nto our eyes like Satan’s own dispirited, disorganized army of volunteers.\r\nI came up beside Father, and he said to me, “Well, Owen, as I feared, they lie\r\nbetween us and the bridge. What say you?”\r\n“They look like a pack of drunken cowards to me.”\r\nJohn then moved his horse alongside Father’s and proposed that one of us\r\nsneak down on foot and cross the river above the bridge and slip into Lawrence,\r\nto inform the leaders there that we had arrived this far and ask for further\r\ninstructions. “It might turn out that it’d be better for them if we stayed hidden\r\nhere,” he said. “Outflank the Ruffians, you know?”\r\n“Useless,” said Father. “If we are to serve any purpose in this, we must get into\r\nLawrence itself’\r\n“The Missourians are rabble,” I said. “Knockabouts. They haven’t the right or\r\nthe will to stop us, if we simply go down there and cross over. The Lord will\r\nprotect us.”\r\nI leveled my rifle at my waist and commenced walking downhill, the same as\r\nwhen I’d walked in amongst the wild boys and men in Boston. Immediately, the\r\nothers followed, as I knew they would. Father rode to the front again and led our\r\nlittle band down the crumbly slope and straight into the rowdy encampment. We\r\ndid not look to one side or the other but marched on a line across the broad,\r\ngrassy floodplain that led to the river and the town of Lawrence beyond.",
    "\r\nThe Ruffians got up and parted as we passed, then came forward and stared at\r\nus, their mouths open, evidently astonished by us and unsure of what we meant\r\nto do, cowed by our wagon rattling its tall spears and our heavy broadswords\r\nand revolvers strapped to our waists, our Sharps rifles leveled and cocked. A few\r\nhollered at us and cursed, but weakly, and we did not acknowledge them. Not\r\none man made a move to stop us. In moments, we had marched through the\r\nstumbling, drunken throng of disheveled men, had crossed the narrow bridge to\r\nthe other side of the Wakarusa, and were moving straightway on to Lawrence,\r\nwhere, as we rode and walked into town and made our way around the rough\r\nearthworks they had thrown up, we were greeted by the frightened citizens with\r\nhuzzahs and much jubilation. Only then did we look at one another and start to\r\nsmile. Even Father.\r\nThe besieged townsmen gaped at our weapons—our broadswords and\r\nbayonets in particular, for they were formidable and implied on our part a desire\r\nfor bloody close combat. And all the citizenry were mightily impressed by our\r\nhaving parted the army of Border Ruffians as if they had been the Red Sea and\r\nwe the ancient Israelites coming out of Egypt. We were, at least for the moment,\r\nheroes. And we wanted to stay that way, especially the Old Man, who at once,\r\nbefore he had even dismounted, as if in a fever, began to harangue the leaders of\r\nthe Committee for Public Safety who had come to welcome us, insisting that\r\nthey brook no compromise with the enemy, make no peace treaty or agreement\r\nwith them. “We should strike now,” Father declared, “whilst they’re still be-\r\ndazzled. Round up a hundred men, and I’ll lead them!” he commanded.\r\nNo one obeyed. They merely kept telling him how pleased they were that we\r\nhad joined them, giving little speeches, the way committees do.",
    "\r\n“Let me speak to the man in charge,” Father finally said, and he and John and\r\nI were immediately taken to address Messrs. Lane and Robinson, who were\r\nlocated in an upstairs room of the half-finished Free-State Hotel, a cavernous\r\nstone building on Massachusetts Street in the center of town, which the\r\nCommittee for Public Safety had appropriated for its headquarters. Mr.\r\nRobinson, who had been a physician and was now the chief agent for the New\r\nEngland Emigration Aid Society and who eventually became the Free-Soil\r\ngovernor of the territory, shook Father’s hand with unctuous pleasure and\r\nnervously passed him on to his evident superior, Mr. Lane, a lean, blade-faced\r\nman in rumpled clothing with a red kerchief around his neck, a well-known\r\nradical abolitionist who’d been leading settlers into Kansas by way of Iowa and\r\nNebraska all year. He was a natural leader of men, comfortable with his\r\nauthority and a shrewd exhorter. His voice had gone raspy and hoarse, evidently\r\nfrom making too many speeches to the crowd of defenders outside, and he\r\nappeared to be greatly fatigued. He seemed not to have slept in a week and\r\nspoke to us while lying down on a horsehair sofa.\r\nJohn, whom Mr. Lane already knew from his politicking, introduced Father\r\nand me, and after greeting us, Mr. Lane explained that, as he was pretty far\r\nalong in his negotiations with the pro-slave governor, Mr. Shannon, and the\r\nleader of the militia encamped beyond the Wakarusa, Mr. Atchison, he did not\r\nwant to disrupt things. “It’s all at a most delicate moment,” he said. But even so,\r\nhe was glad to have reinforcements from Father, whom he referred to as “the\r\naged gentleman from the state of New York.” He urged us to hold off from any\r\nviolent action until or unless a peace treaty became impossible. “I don’t want\r\nanyone killed,” he said. “Least of all women and children.",
    " And that’s no army\r\nout there by the river, as you surely saw. It’s a mob, and their leaders have\r\nalmost no control over them.”\r\nBut there was no reasoning with Father. Nor with me, for that matter,\r\nalthough I stayed silent and let Father speak for me. He stormed up and down\r\nthe lamp-lit room, declaring that we should launch an attack this very minute,\r\ntime was wasting, we could achieve complete victory over these scalawags now\r\nand be done with it.\r\n“Father, for heaven’s sake,” John finally said. He was himself plenty relieved\r\nto hear that a peace treaty might be at hand. “Hear Mister Lane out.” But the Old\r\nMan’s blood was up for battle now, and he did not want to hear any talk of\r\ncompromise with men who would enslave other men. He stated that a condition\r\nof war existed between the Free-Soilers and the pro-slavery men, and we must\r\ngive no quarter, especially now that John Brown and his sons had shown\r\neveryone what cowards the Ruffians were.\r\nI was glad to hear the Old Man going on with such ferocity. I had never before\r\nfelt as I did then, like a true warrior, invulnerable and powerful: a righteous\r\nkiller. I felt, and evidently Father did also, a strange, new invincibility, which we\r\nmust have obtained from having marched untouched through the ranks of the\r\nenemy. It was as if we were wearing invisible armor and could not be harmed by\r\nbullet or sword. I wanted to test that armor, to risk it against the guns and\r\nswords of the Border Ruffians, and Father’s words spoke for my desires. So go\r\non, Old Man, I thought, rouse these people to fight! Don’t let them go\r\nmaundering on about negotiations, treaties, and orderly retreats. We want to\r\nrout the slaveholders! We want to send them howling back to Missouri, leaving a\r\ntrail of blood behind and a territory cleansed of the evil of slavery forever.\r\nTaken aback by Father’s furious declarations, Mr.",
    " Lane, a cynical man,\r\nevidently misunderstood the Old Man’s motives. It was as if he believed that\r\nwhat Father wanted was glory only, and not necessarily the immediate death of\r\nhis enemies. He interrupted Father, and as if to placate and thus to silence him,\r\nabruptly proposed to commission him a captain in the First Brigade of Kansas\r\nVolunteers. He would give him his own command, he said, a company to be\r\ncalled the Liberty Guards, which would consist of the Captain’s own brave sons\r\nand other men, up to a total of fifteen, as were willing to volunteer to join the\r\ncompany under Captain Brown’s personal command.\r\nThis seemed to surprise Father and to please him greatly, for he stopped his\r\nfulminations at once and thanked Mr. Lane and then begged to leave, so that he\r\ncould quickly begin interviewing men who might wish to join him.\r\n“Captain Brown;’ Mr. Lane said. “I salute you, sir, and I thank you for your\r\nwillingness, even at your advanced age, to join in the defense of the people of\r\nthis poor town.” He lay back on his sofa, draped one arm across his chest, and\r\nclosed his eyes, dismissing us.\r\n“I should like to make my son Owen here my lieutenant, if you have no\r\nobjection, sir.”\r\n“Excellent, Captain. Fine. Whatever you wish,” he said, and Mr. Robinson\r\nofficiously ushered us from the room.\r\nAs we descended the rough staircase to the large, open hall below, Father\r\ninstructed John and me to circulate in the town and recruit the best Christian\r\nmen we could find and bring them to him out on the barricades, by which time\r\nhe would have a battleplan. “I did not bring those rifles and swords all the way\r\nout here for nothing,” he pronounced.\r\nJohn hung back noticeably, until Father asked him what was the matter.\r\nHe then stepped up to the Old Man and looked him straight in the face.",
    " “I\r\nwant to know, Father, why didn’t you ask Mister Lane to make me a lieutenant,\r\ntoo? This is no criticism of Owen,” he said. “I just want to know your thinking\r\non the matter.”\r\nFather smiled and said, “You’re a good man to wonder that and to want the\r\nsame as Owen.” He placed one hand on John’s shoulder and the other on mine\r\nand looked at us with evident pride. “You, John,” he said, “you will be my\r\npolitical officer. I can’t limit you to a military role. You have too great an ability\r\nfor dealing with people for that, and besides, we must keep the tasks separate.\r\nOwen will be my military officer, which is why I’ve made him a lieutenant. Boys,\r\nI tell thee, there will come a day when you will think back to these moments\r\nwhich have just ended, and you will see them as having begun a mighty thing. I\r\npromise thee. There is a plan behind all this. The Lord’s plan. And He has given\r\nme mine.”\r\nJohn shrugged, evidently still unsatisfied, but unwilling to pursue his point\r\nfurther, and departed from us to do as Father had asked, while I eagerly went a\r\ndifferent way, also in search of recruits for Father’s company of Liberty Guards.\r\nTo my surprise, I was immediately successful, as there were in Lawrence at that\r\nmoment hundreds of men who were eager to follow the newly commissioned\r\nCaptain Brown, for the nature of our arrival had thrilled the town and our\r\nreputation for valor and righteousness had swiftly grown large. It took me barely\r\nan hour of hurried conversations with men in the barber shops and stores and in\r\nthe hotel lobby before I found myself walking the main street with forty or fifty\r\nof them trailing behind. When finally I thought I had enough, I turned back to\r\ntake them to Father, and along the muddy street came John, leading an equal\r\nnumber.",
    "\r\nFather was at the earthworks, which was a ditch and a head-high bank of dirt\r\nheaped across the wide central street at the edge of town. Most of the town’s\r\ndefenders had positioned themselves behind the bank with their rifles and were\r\nwatching the fires of the enemy camp across the river with mild curiosity and\r\nnot a little fear. Father was engaged in heavy discussion with several men,\r\nmilitia captains like himself, urging them to join him in a frontal charge against\r\nthe Ruffians. Red-faced, stamping angrily and flailing his arms, Father was\r\narguing strenuously with the gentlemen. “Those who don’t have guns can be\r\narmed with pitchforks!” he said. “If my company leads the charge, and the entire\r\npopulace comes rushing out against them, the Ruffians will be terrified and will\r\nflee back to Missouri for their lives!”\r\nThe other militia leaders would have none of it, however. But then Father saw\r\nme and John approaching with our flock of volunteers, and abruptly he turned\r\naway from his colleagues and led our troop towards our Roman wagon, where\r\nthe other boys were lounging around, chatting like old veterans with various\r\ntownspeople.\r\nThe Old Man jumped up on the box and, placing his hands on his hips,\r\nsurveyed the crowd of volunteers. “I can take no more than eight, for a total\r\nmembership of fifteen,” he declared. “And you must be as willing to die for the\r\ncause as my sons and I myself are.” Quite a few drifted away at this. “We are\r\nhere to slay the enemy of the Lord. I want bloodthirsty men at my side. No\r\nkittenish weaklings, no mild-mannered Garrisonians, no cowards who prefer\r\npeace with the slavers to war. And no men whose courage depends on whiskey. I\r\nwant temperance men.” Here a number of men turned and strolled away. “And\r\nye must be Christians,” he said. “True soldiers of the Lord is what I need!",
    " Ye\r\nmust be armored by God, for we are going forth to smite His enemies down!”\r\nAnd now there were but a dozen remaining. “And ye must swear, as I and my\r\nsons have sworn, to wash chattel slavery off the map of this territory. Even if it\r\nbe washed with thine own blood. Ye must swear to purge it from the nation as a\r\nwhole. What we begin here will not end until the entire country is free!” Now\r\nthere were only three men standing by the wagon, one of whom, it turned out,\r\nwas the well-known journalist Mr. James Redpath, from the New York Tribune,\r\nwho would follow us throughout the Kansas wars and make us famous all over\r\nthe East but would not join us in battle. The two others, as it happened, we\r\nalready knew and did not want—Mr. Theodore Weiner, a big, brutal Dutchman\r\nwho kept a store on the Pottawatomie Creek a few miles below our camp, and an\r\nolder man, Mr. James Townley, a longtime settler in Osawatomie, originally\r\nfrom Illinois, who had acquired a reputation for quarrelsomeness.\r\nFrom his perch, Father looked sadly down at them. “Well, if ye be all who\r\nremain... then I believe I have the men I need,” he said, and he bade them raise\r\ntheir right hands and swore them into the Liberty Guards.\r\nBut there was to be no battle that day, although the episode, thanks to Mr.\r\nRedpath’s lively, vivid dispatches back East, soon came to be known as the\r\n“Wakarusa War”—when the brave citizens of Lawrence, Kansas, under the\r\ncourageous leadership of Captain John Brown, drove off a thousand Border\r\nRuffians and afterwards forced the pro-slave leaders to accept conditions that\r\namounted to total surrender. The reality was that, while Father railed in vain\r\nagainst the citizens of the town for their reluctance to follow him and charge the\r\nMissourians’ camp, Messrs.",
    " Lane and Robinson slipped out the back of the hotel\r\nand rode down to the town of Franklin, a few miles south of Lawrence, where\r\nthey secretly met with the pro-slavery governor of the territory, Mr. Shannon,\r\nalong with Senator Atchison and several other leaders of the Ruffians. These men\r\nhad grown alarmed at having lost control of their supporters and consequently\r\nagreed to take their ragtag army back to Leavenworth at once, if the case of the\r\nshooting of the Ohioan Mr. Charles Dow was dropped by John’s protest\r\ncommittee of Free-Soilers. The committee, they insisted, had been an act of\r\nprovocation. Its dissolution would restore the peace. Messrs. Lane and Robinson\r\nthought that a perfect arrangement. They drew up a treaty, signed it, and\r\nreturned to Lawrence to oversee the quick withdrawal of the Missourians and to\r\nenjoy the gratitude and adulation of the Free-Soilers.\r\nExcept for us, of course. We admired them not a whit and thought their treaty\r\na surrender. Nonetheless, we stayed on in Lawrence for a few days longer. We\r\nwere the only ones who had dared to confront the Ruffians directly and were\r\nmuch admired for it, especially by the younger men in town, and this puffed us\r\nup somewhat and took some of the sting out of Father’s failure to enlist more\r\nthan two sorry men in his Liberty Guards, and it justified his anger at Lane and\r\nRobinson for having bargained with the enemy. Finally, though, we grew\r\nrestless, and John and Jason began to worry about their wives and John’s son,\r\nTonny, so Father, who had been spending much of his time giving interviews to\r\nMr. Redpath and the many other journalists who were flocking into Lawrence,\r\ngave the order to depart for home.",
    "\r\nHome was then still our tents at Browns Station, John’s and Jason’s land claims,\r\nand at one point on our way back there, I had with Father a small conversation\r\nthat turned out later to have large consequences. It was late in the afternoon,\r\nand we were a few miles past the old California Road and the cabin of Ottawa\r\nJones, traveling along a broad ridge that curved slowly above the floodplain of\r\nthe Marais des Cygnes River. I was coming along at the rear of our little train,\r\ndeep in thought of home at that moment, which meant memories of Lyman and\r\nSusan Epps and the calamity at Lake Colden, when I was brought suddenly out\r\nof my dark, cold cavern of thought by the clatter of hoofbeats. Father had turned\r\nhis red horse back past the wagon to the rear, and when he drew abreast of me,\r\nhe dismounted and walked along beside me in silence for a ways.\r\nFinally, after a while, he said, “I had a most interesting word with Mister Lane\r\nbefore we left.”\r\n“You mean he granted you an audience.” Still smoldering with anger for\r\nhaving been betrayed by Lane’s cowardice and ambition, I could barely speak of\r\nhim except with sarcasm and disdain. Popularity, that’s all these men cared\r\nabout, top to bottom, from the traitorous New Englanders Franklin Pierce and\r\nDaniel Webster down to the pullets who ran the Committee for Public Safety of\r\nLawrence, Kansas—these men sold their souls for the adulation of a mob, while\r\nthe bodies of millions of Americans continued to be sold on the auction block.\r\nThat’s how I reflected then: the second a subject was introduced to me,\r\nregardless of what it was, I would find my thoughts connected to a series of\r\npulleys and belts, as if my mind were a factory, so that the mere mention of Mr.\r\nLane’s name brought me in seconds to the grisly specter of permanent Negro\r\nslavery.",
    "\r\nFather said, “I informed him that I intended to resume the fight that had been\r\nso unfortunately interrupted by his willingness to negotiate with the slavers.”\r\n“What did he say to that?” It was raining lightly, and the ground was muddy\r\nand dark, even up here on the ridge—hard going for the horses. Our company\r\nnow included Father’s new recruits, one of whom, Mr. Weiner, had his own\r\nwagon, and the journalist Mr. Redpath, who seemed to think Father a moral and\r\nmilitary genius, a view the Old Man did not discourage, for he knew that the\r\nman’s communiques were rapidly enlarging the reputation of John Brown back\r\nEast and would encourage continued financial and logistical support for our\r\nventure, regardless of what the rest of the Free-Soilers wanted. Father now knew\r\nthat here, as much as back in North Elba or Springfield, it was not enough\r\nmerely to be against slavery. Too many Free-Soilers, in reality, only wanted\r\npeace. Thus, so long as we were allied with white people, we had enemies\r\namongst our own ranks. Here, in the absence of free blacks, we were obliged to\r\ndo the Lord’s work alone.\r\n“Mister Lane urged me to hold my fire but to keep my powder dry.”\r\n“That old saw.”\r\n“Yes. But he also revealed to me that he had met with Governor Shannon a\r\nsecond time, after the Ruffians had withdrawn back to Leavenworth. They got\r\nthe governor so drunk that the man signed a document which authorizes the\r\nFree-Soilers to use force the next time the Missourians enter our territory.”\r\n“What does that mean to us?”\r\nFather laughed. “Why, it’s a legal license, son! A license to shoot Missourians.\r\nOr anyone else who would obstruct us in the work. We would do it anyway, I\r\nknow, but this makes it legal.”\r\n“Well, good,” I said grimly.\r\n“I thought that would pleaseyou,”he said, and slapped me on the shoulder.",
    "\r\nThen he mounted his horse and rode to the front of the line and led us home.\r\nWith the death of Lyman Epps, I had crossed a line that I would never cross back\r\nover again. I could not: Lyman’s death at Lake Colden had made me permanently\r\na different man. It froze me at the center of my heart, gathering ice in layers\r\naround it, so that, in a short time, I had become outwardly a hard man, a grim,\r\nsilent warrior in my father’s army, soon to be a killer more feared by the slavers\r\nfor his cold, avenging spirit than any Free-Soil man in all of Kansas. More feared\r\neven than Father, Captain John Brown himself, Old Brown, who, at least until\r\nPottawatomie, was viewed by the slavers and even by most of the abolitionists\r\nas dangerous mainly because of his peculiar, but not especially long-lasting,\r\ninfluence over the young, idealistic men coming out from the East and because\r\nof his refusal to work in concert with the regular Free-Soil militias, even the one\r\nled by his son John, and with the legally instituted authorities in Lawrence. Oh,\r\nFather stamped his feet and grew nearly apoplectic with rage against the\r\nregulars, as he did against the President of the United States, the Democrats, and\r\neven the Republicans, against the abolitionists back East who were now and then\r\nreluctant to send him money and arms, against the timidity of the Free-Soil\r\nauthorities in Lawrence and Topeka, and, always, against the pro-slavers, the\r\nMissourians, the Border Ruffians, the drunken Southern Negro-hating squatters\r\ndown along the Pottawatomie River who were threatening in their newspapers\r\nand meetings to wipe the Yankees, and especially us Browns, off the face of the\r\nearth. But in most people’s minds, even in the minds of our enemies, the Old\r\nMan was, indeed, an old man, “the elderly gentleman from the state of New\r\nYork” a man in his middle fifties.",
    " His rage and spluttering, given his radical\r\nabolitionist ideology and his old-fashioned, Puritanical form of Christian belief,\r\nwere understandable, if not quite coherent.\r\nNo, the man that people on all sides worried about was me, the red-headed\r\nson, the one with the crippled arm. My brothers told me this with a mixture of\r\npride and mild concern. They reported that of all the Browns, I was viewed, as\r\nmuch in Lawrence as among the pro-slavers in Atchison, as the most dangerous.\r\nThey said it was because I spoke to no one, except Father and my brothers, and\r\nshowed no human feeling, except for a single-minded desire to exterminate the\r\nman-sellers. They were right to fear me. I was an assassin with no principle or\r\nideology and with no apparent religion, save one: death to slavery.\r\nMy brother John, widely admired for his probity and his physical courage, had\r\nsucceeded in being elected to the Free-State legislature and had been\r\ncommissioned a lieutenant and given command of a militia unit, the\r\nOsawatomie Rifles, a defensive force meant to include all able-bodied anti-\r\nslavery men in and around the town of Osawatomie and Browns Station, our\r\nhome territory. Father, however, insisted on withholding himself from the Rifles\r\n—no one could imagine him taking orders from John anyhow, but it was a\r\nlifelong pattern for him to keep himself separate and distinct from another man’s\r\narmy. Except for Jason—who, by following John into the Rifles, had chosen the\r\nroute least likely to lead to violence—the rest of us stuck with Father and viewed\r\nourselves strictly as his men and subject to no other authority than his.\r\nCounting Father, then, we were now a band of six: brothers Fred, Salmon, and\r\nOliver, our brother-in-law Henry Thompson, and me. Watson was still back in\r\nNorth Elba, taking care of the farm and family—my old job.",
    " Here and there, at\r\ndifferent times, we were joined by some of the more radical, quarrelsome, old-\r\ntime settlers, like the Austrian Weiner and James Townley, and by the\r\nnewcomers to Kansas who had heard of Captain Brown back East and wanted to\r\nfight slavery alongside him and his sons; they were mostly young hot-bloods\r\nwho made their way to Lawrence and came down to Osawatomie and found our\r\ncamp and rode with us awhile and then drifted over to one of the more regular\r\nmilitias or grew discouraged by the rigors of the life and took out a land claim\r\nand built a cabin on it and began to farm. A few stayed on with us, or came and\r\nwent and came back again—those who could comply with Father’s ban on\r\nwhiskey-drinking, swearing, and tobacco, who were willing to honor the\r\nSabbath with him by listening to him preach and pray all day, and, most\r\nimportantly, men who were able to subject their wills entirely to his, for he\r\nbrooked no correction or argument, and he consulted no one. No one except me\r\n—who had the Old Man’s ear now and knew when to whisper into it and urge\r\nhim on to action, who knew when and how to suggest retreat, who knew exactly\r\nthe way to buck him up when his spirits flagged and how to calm him back to\r\nreason when his temper made him intolerant and his frustration with the peace-\r\nmaking cowardice and caution of others turned him into a sputtering dervish.\r\nThere was that spring greatly increased, widespread provocation amongst the\r\npro-slavers, and threatening noises from the clans of Border Ruffians down along\r\nthe Pottawatomie, and at Browns Station, especially, we were increasingly\r\nagitated and kept ourselves in a constant state of alarm, if not readiness. All the\r\nFree-Soil militias were pledged to participate strictly in defensive action, but it\r\nwas growing less clear by the day as to what that term meant.",
    " Particularly in the\r\nface of constant death-threats from the settlers on the Pottawatomie—the Dutch\r\nSherman faction, as we thought of them. They had settled that narrow, eroded\r\ngorge several years back, well before the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act,\r\nand thus they were mainly concerned with land-grabbing, not politics. We knew\r\nthat they were using the slavery issue only to justify burning and driving us out\r\nand capturing our claims up on the more fertile open floodplain of the Marais\r\ndes Cygnes, which, in their ignorance, they had passed over when they first\r\ncame out from Arkansas and Tennessee.\r\nThen one day late in April, the pro-slavery Sheriff Jones rode over from\r\nAtchison to Lawrence with a small posse of U.S. troops and apprehended six\r\nFree-Soil citizens and charged them with contempt of court for refusing to\r\nidentify the leader of the party that had rescued John the previous month, that\r\nbrave adventure which had led to the first Lawrence siege and stand-off. That\r\nsame night, an unknown person shot Sheriff Jones outside of Lawrence as he and\r\nhis troop of federal soldiers were leading their six prisoners off to Atchison. The\r\nprisoners did not flee, however, and Jones did not die of his wound. In fact, to\r\nmy and Father’s astonishment, the entire town of Lawrence and its leadership\r\nwere aggrieved by the shooting and publically apologized for it and condemned\r\nthe unknown shooter outright.\r\nThe shooter, of course, was me. In company with the Old Man and my\r\nbrothers. We had learned of the sheriff’s mission and had ridden over towards\r\nLawrence to help oppose it, and at nightfall, a mile north of Hickory Point, had\r\ncome up on the posse and prisoners on their way back to Atchison, where the six\r\nwere to stand trial. There were but four soldiers in the posse and the Sheriff.",
    " The\r\nOld Man was all for throwing down on them at once and seizing their prisoners\r\nin person and delivering them safely back to Lawrence, where he said we were\r\nsure to be acclaimed as heroes, recalling, perhaps, our previous miraculous\r\nintervention.\r\nI said to him, “No, it’s near dark. They’ll hear us coming and will run. Or else\r\nthey’ll use the prisoners as hostages and put up a fight. The prisoners may be\r\nkilled and the slavers escape.”\r\n“But Jones and his men are cowards at heart;’ the Old Man argued. “They’re\r\njust conscripts. And the Lord will protect His children.” We were perched unseen\r\nin the growing darkness on a rise, hidden in a stand of black walnut trees, and\r\nSheriff Jones’s party was heading slowly along a draw below, which led south to\r\nthe crossroads of the Santa Fe Trail and the old California trail, thence north and\r\neast to Atchison. The sheriff was in the lead, and his prisoners were seated in a\r\ntrap driven by one of the troopers, while the others rode along in a line behind.\r\n“Look, it’s almost too dark to do anything at all” I pointed out. “But I can bring\r\ndown the sheriff with a single shot now. The soldier-boys will panic, and the\r\nchildren of the Lord can escape in the confusion. We’ll pick them up later for\r\nreturn to Lawrence.” I got down from the wagon box and took a position behind\r\na tree and leveled my rifle.\r\nIn a second, Father was at my side. “Hold up, son. Maybe we should think on\r\nthis a bit.”\r\n“If we think on it, the opportunity will be lost.”\r\nI did not say it, but we both knew that if I did not drop the sheriff now, Father\r\nwould once again be jumping up and down in a foaming rage, crying that\r\nnothing had been done to oppose this outrageous illegality, and he’d be blaming\r\nthe men in Lawrence for their failure of nerve, instead of himself for his. I was as\r\nweary of his complaints as I was of their inaction.",
    "\r\nHe nodded approval, and I turned back to my task, aimed, and fired. Done.\r\nSheriff Jones toppled from his horse.\r\nA simple act. But instantly, with that shot, much changed.\r\nWith that one shot from my Sharps rifle, we shucked our identity as defenders\r\nof freedom and became full-fledged guerilla fighters. I knew it beforehand and\r\nintended it and recognized it when it happened.\r\nHaving finally gone on the offensive this way, we could no longer claim to\r\nourselves or to anyone else that we had come out here to Kansas to farm or even\r\nto make Kansas a free state. No, it was now inescapably clear to all, but\r\nespecially and most importantly to the Southerners, that we Browns were here in\r\nKansas solely to wage war against slavery. The Missourians and pro-slavers all\r\nover the South who had been screaming for abolitionist blood, who had cried in\r\nthe headlines of their newspapers, War to the knife, and knife to the hilt! were\r\njustified now. Their very lives, as much as their foul institutions, were under\r\nattack. We were their enemy now, as much as they had been ours all along.\r\nThe sheriff had gone down. But then he crawled to the wagon, and to our\r\nsurprise, the Free-Soil prisoners from Lawrence helped him aboard and laid him\r\nout and appeared to be tending to him, while the soldiers got off their horses\r\nand drew close around the wagon and waited to be fired upon. “Did you kill\r\nhim?” Father asked in a tense whisper. “Did you kill the man?” He was at my ear\r\nand had a hand on each of my shoulders. The others, Fred and Salmon, had\r\ncome forward and were crouched behind us.\r\n“No.”\r\n“You bloodied him, though,” Salmon said. “They’re ripping off his shirt.”\r\n“But why are they helping him and not escaping?” Father asked. “All they’ve\r\ngot to do is run, right?”\r\nNo one answered.\r\n“I think we should go down there and I should address them,” Father\r\nannounced.",
    "\r\n“No;’ I said. “Better they don’t know who has shot at them or from where.\r\nMake them think we’re everywhere. A single, well-aimed shot can be more\r\nterrifying than a fusillade.”\r\nThe Old Man pondered that for a second, and then he smiled. “Yes. Good.\r\nThat’s good, Owen. Very good. Come on, boys,”he said, suddenly in charge\r\nagain, although I detected a new note of apprehension in his voice. Certainly,\r\nFather understood the implications of this act as well as I did. “Let’s ride on to\r\nLawrence. And we’ll say nothing of this to anyone. Nothing. All either side needs\r\nto know is that there are some abolitionists who are not afraid to shoot, and that\r\nsuch men are everywhere—nowhere and anywhere. They don’t need to know the\r\nnames of the shooters. Not yet anyhow. You look down there, boys, look,” he\r\nordered, and pointed into the arroyo below at the sight of Free-Soil prisoners\r\nand federal troopers scrambling to protect and aid a fallen proslavery sheriff.\r\n“See how little we can trust even our own kind. Traitors;’ he pronounced them.\r\n“There below, children, there are the Israelites who betrayed Rehoboam, the son\r\nof Solomon, gone to worship the golden calves of Jeroboam. Look at them, boys.\r\nLet us, from here on out, keep completely to ourselves,” he said. “Completely.”\r\nAnd so we did. There were, of course, immediate and serious consequences to\r\nmy shooting the sheriff, but they were not by us particularly unwanted.\r\nAlthough we were widely suspected, by both sides, to have been the hotheads\r\nwho wounded Sheriff Jones, Father neither admitted nor denied the charge and\r\nsaid only that he himself had not fired on the man but it was a shame he hadn’t\r\nbeen killed. The pro-slavery newspapers went wild, and rumors of imminent war\r\nflew across the territory, exciting and frightening everyone on all sides.",
    "\r\nMissourians and other Southerners gathered together in packs along the border,\r\nas if ready to invade. Mobs in Atchison and Leavenworth captured a pair of\r\nprominent Free-State men there on business and tarred them and stuck tufts of\r\ncotton all over their bodies, tied the men to their horses, and sent them down\r\nthe Santa Fe Trail, where they were found the next day a few miles north of\r\nLawrence.\r\nIt was around this time that, with John and Jason spending so much time up\r\nin Lawrence with the Osawatomie Rifles and the Free-State legislature, Father\r\ndecided that we had better send the women and Tonny over to Uncle Sam\r\nAdair’s place in the village of Osawatomie. He also decided to abandon Browns\r\nStation and move to a temporary camp in the trackless brushland along the\r\nMosquito Creek, a camp that every few days we could shift to a new location.\r\nWe were free as the wind off the plains now, able to appear and disappear\r\nalmost at will. Everything we owned we carried in one wagon, and most of what\r\nwe owned was weaponry. We were all of us on horseback by now, thanks to\r\nstock we had liberated from the hands of the slavers, although we had not\r\nsaddles for everyone, and Fred and Oliver, when he wasn’t driving the wagon,\r\nrode bareback. Roaming the rolling, treeless hillcountry and slipping along the\r\ndark river-bottoms where black walnut, oak, and cottonwood trees grew in lush\r\ngroves, we were more like a roving Indian band than a company of white\r\nguerillas. Our chieftain, who was Father, of course, always Father, set policy, but\r\nI decided day-to-day on how best to implement that policy.",
    "\r\nThen, on the second of May, when we were encamped in the woods just south\r\nof the old French trading post on the Marais des Cygnes, a rich Missouri planter\r\nnamed Jefferson Buford, who had rounded up close to four hundred men from\r\nall over the South, led his mob straight across the border into the territory. Not\r\nten miles from us, men were flying banners that cried, The Supremacy of the\r\nWhite Race! and Alabama for Kansas. A day later, we heard from a local Free-\r\nState settler that, out on the Peoria Indian lands, fifteen miles from our old camp\r\nat Browns Station, a company of some thirty or so Georgians loosely attached to\r\nBuford’s force had pitched their tents and were carousing, working up their\r\ncourage with whiskey and insults. It was country that we knew firsthand and\r\nwell, so on a cold, overcast day, Father and I rode out there in the wagon to\r\nreconnoiter and see what we could learn of the character of Colonel Buford’s\r\nforce. We pretended to be government surveyors running a line that happened to\r\nlie in the middle of their squat. Calling ourselves Ruben Shiloh and his son Owen\r\nfrom Indiana and pretending to have no opinions on the struggle over Kansas,\r\nFather and I stopped for a while by the Georgians’ cook wagon, where most of\r\nthe men had assembled to drink corn whiskey and lounge idly by the fire, two of\r\ntheir favorite activities, it seemed. We secretly counted the number of their\r\nhorses and weapons, sidearms mostly and old, single-shot hunting rifles, and we\r\ntalked a little and listened a lot, as they loudly cursed the abolitionists and swore\r\nto kill every last one. They loved their leader, Jefferson Buford, and called him\r\nColonel Buford, although, when Father asked, they could not say in which army\r\nor militia he had been commissioned.",
    "\r\nThey were a staggering, loutish bunch of poor, ignorant, landless Southerners,\r\nmen who bragged that they had come over to Kansas to help themselves first, by\r\nseizing abolitionists’ land-claims, and the South second, by killing as many\r\nYankee nigger-lovers as they could find. “Especially those damned Browns,”\r\nwhom they’d been hearing about from the Shermans and Doyles down on the\r\nPottawatomie. “Them Browns’re goin’ first!” they declared. We tipped our hats\r\nand rode on.\r\nLater, in the wagon on the way back to our camp, for a long time Father and I\r\nwere silent, each of us lost in his own thoughts. Finally, when we were four or\r\nfive miles from the Georgians’, Father turned to me and said, “You know, Owen,\r\nthe real problem here isn’t what it seems. It’s not our differences from those\r\nfellows. The real problem is that those men truly don’t understand us.”\r\n“How’s that a problem?”\r\n“It just came to me, so I’ll have to say it as I think it. But the pro-slavers, all\r\nthese Border Ruffians coming over from the South—fact is, they think we’re just\r\nlike them except that we’re Northerners, that’s all. They think that, like them,\r\nwe’ve come out here at the behest and in the pay of a gang of rich men and\r\npoliticians. In their minds, we’re out here following some Yankee version of their\r\nColonel Buford, and, like them, all we want out of this for ourselves is a piece of\r\nfree land. Strange. But that is the problem.”\r\n“What’s the solution, then?”\r\n“I’m not sure. I think we have to show them somehow that they’re wrong\r\nabout us. We should figure out how to show these Southerners the true nature\r\nand extremity of our principles. We have to show them the difference between\r\nthem and us. Mainly, they have to see that we are willing to die for this. For\r\nthey are not.",
    " And more to the point, because they are not willing to die for their\r\ncause, they have to see that we are willing to kill for ours. There it is! That’s our\r\nsecret strength, Owen. All those poor, drunken fools and thieves, they really do\r\nbelieve that we are cowards, no different than they, and that Kansas, since they\r\npresently outnumber us, is easy pickings. And if they cry bloody murder and\r\nthreaten to burn down our houses, it’s only because they think that as soon as\r\nthe battle starts, we’ll pack up and run north and leave them our land.”\r\n“They’ll see otherwise;’ I said.\r\n“Now is the time, I believe. It’s time, Owen, time to buckle on our swords and\r\nwade straight into their midst. It’s time to wreak bloody havoc. We need to slay\r\nso many of them with a single, terrifying blow that the rest will start having\r\nsobering second thoughts.”\r\n“Fine by me. I’d kill every last one. Give them only enough Kansas soil to lie\r\ndown dead in.”\r\n“You would, but maybe you won’t have to. I know men like this. I’ve seen\r\nthem everywhere, even in the North. It’s a basic human type. These fellows are\r\nonly the degraded, pathetic pawns of other men, who are much more evil than\r\ntheir pawns. Oh, sure, these poor, deluded fellows hate Negroes, all right, and\r\nthey love slavery. But not because they themselves own Negro slaves or depend\r\nupon them to work their puny farms. You don’t see any slave-traders amongst\r\nthese fellows, do you? And no cotton planters, either. No, these are poor men,\r\nOwen. And like most people, North and South, but especially South, they’re\r\nlandless and slaveless and ignorant and illiterate. They’re serfs, practically, but\r\nwith no lord of the manor to protect them. And it’s because they’ve been taught\r\nfor centuries to love and envy the rich man who owns slaves that they hate the\r\nNegro, and now they have come out here to conquer Kansas for slavery.",
    " That’s\r\nall. Poor, deluded fools. Because their skin’s as white as the rich man’s, they\r\nbelieve that they might someday be rich themselves. But without the Negro,\r\nOwen, these men would be forced to see that, in fact, they have no more chance\r\nof becoming rich than do the very slaves they despise and trample on. They’d see\r\nhow close they are to being slaves themselves. Thus, to protect and nurture their\r\ndream of becoming someday, somehow, rich, they don’t need actually to own\r\nslaves, so much as they need to keep the Negro from ever being free.”\r\n“Very nice” I said. “But how do you propose to show them this?” I asked, out\r\nof politeness more than interest. Father’s endless, convoluted theories concerning\r\nslavery and Negroes frequently strengthened my brothers’ resolve, and even\r\nfrom time to time charged up the Old Man himself, but they had long since\r\nceased to motivate me. I had my own motivations, which needed no firming.\r\nIron hardeneth iron. For me, the soft, warm days of pusillanimity were long\r\ngone.\r\n“Well, there’s only one way. We must strike pure terror into their hearts,\r\nOwen. Pure terror. Pure! We must become terrible!” he growled. We had to\r\nmake the Border Ruffians understand that they had to be ready to die miserably\r\nfor this. If we showed them that their bits of Kansas Territory would not come to\r\nthem otherwise, they’d go galloping straight back to Alabama and Georgia,\r\nwhere they could lie and boast in the taverns and bawdyhouses all they wanted.\r\nAll we cared was that Kansas be left a free state, so that we could go back to\r\nFather’s old plan of breaking the rich slaveholder’s back by drawing off the\r\nNegro labor force with the Subterranean Passway, his plan to turn the\r\nUnderground Railroad into a north-flowing river of fugitives.",
    " Then, to get their\r\nsugar and cotton and corn and tobacco grown, the planters would be forced to\r\nturn to their fellow whites and would start enslaving them. And when they did\r\nthat, poor white men would know their true enemies at last. They’d see that\r\ntheir true allies all along had been us abolitionists and the freed blacks living up\r\nNorth and the Southern Negroes who still remained in bondage. With its main\r\nsupports gone, Satan’s temple of slavery would come tumbling down, and then\r\nthe Negro would no longer be despised in the land. The poor, landless black man\r\nand the poor white would fall into one another’s arms.\r\n“Sounds good, Father,” I said. “Sounds real good.” I cracked the reins and\r\nmoved the wagon a little more smartly along, as it looked like rain in the west.\r\nThe huge, milky-white Kansas sky had gone all yellow near the horizon and then\r\nhad suddenly darkened overhead. Long grasses riffled and swirled in the wind\r\nlike the soft surface of the sea, changing from pale blue to green to steel gray in\r\nthe broody, late afternoon light. Our trail was an ancient buffalo road, a grass-\r\ncovered depression through the high, flat, endless field, which we followed as if\r\nin the wake of a westering ship, and I half-expected to see eddies of foam and\r\nbubbles out there before us. Ragged sheets of lightning shook down from the\r\nsouthern sky, and a few seconds later, the rumble of thunder rolled across the\r\nplain like distant cannonfire.\r\n“What say you to that, son?” Father shouted over the wind. He was holding on\r\nto the seat with both hands, as the wagon bucked and dipped across the rough,\r\ngrassy plain towards the long, purple line of cottonwoods in the river-bottom\r\nahead, where our camp was located.\r\n“To what?”\r\n“To my thoughts!”\r\n“Oh, I like it!” I shouted back.\r\n“Like what?”\r\n“Becoming terrible! I like becoming terrible!",
    "”\r\nHe loosened one hand from the box and flung his sinewy arm around my\r\nshoulders. “Oh, thou hast lately become a true soldier of the Lord, Owen!” He\r\npulled me to him and laughed. Then suddenly the sky opened up, and a cold rain\r\npoured down, silencing us for the rest of the way into camp.\r\nOnce there, when we had climbed down from the wagon and come into the\r\nflapping tent, Salmon, Fred, Oliver, and Henry greeted us with great excitement\r\nand gave us news that set us immediately to loading the wagon with our\r\nweapons, and with Oliver up on the box driving the team and Father and the\r\nrest of us on horseback, we six headed on through the downpour straight on to\r\nLawrence.\r\nIn our absence, the boys had learned that the Missourian Colonel Butord and\r\nhis four hundred Southerners and hundreds more in smaller gangs of\r\nSoutherners were headed for Lawrence from several directions, and this time\r\nthey were coming in determined to burn the town to the ground. To justify their\r\nattack, the pro-slavers now had a legal pretext, in that, a few days earlier, a\r\ngrand jury in Atchison had indicted all the Free-State leaders for high treason\r\nand the editors of the Herald Freedom, the Free-State newspaper, for sedition.\r\nThis time, the Border Ruffians meant to stamp out the abolitionists once and for\r\nall. They meant to take our citadel and burn it and sow salt where it had stood\r\nand wipe all memory of Free-State resistance from Kansas forever.\r\nThe possibility of this occurring brought Father to a fever-pitch of excitement.\r\nAs usual, it was the idea of battle more than the reality that made the Old Maris\r\nblood boil and his tongue wag. In some surprising ways and more than he\r\nthought, Father resembled the very Southerners he claimed to be at war with.",
    "\r\nUp to a point, it made him an effective leader of more conventional men than\r\nhe, which was most men, of course, but that point was where the battle itself\r\nactually began.\r\nHe was not afraid exactly; Father was a courageous man. Simply, it was as if\r\nhe could not cease controlling a situation, and whenever he reached that\r\nmoment when he no longer was able to shape and determine things, he backed\r\noff. Which was why, I suppose, he needed me. I made no show of this and do not\r\nthink that I tricked him into depending on me or moved him in any way\r\ncontrary to his essential desires, even though he never quite said outright that,\r\nonce he had properly positioned himself at the edge of battle, he needed me to\r\nbring him over it. Rather, it was our unstated agreement, our tacit\r\nunderstanding, that he was the one to lead us to the precipice, and I was the one\r\nto carry us across.\r\nOut on the California Road, where it joined the Osawatomie Road down to our\r\nold, abandoned camp at Browns Station, we met up with two companies of\r\nvolunteers, about thirty men, parts of John’s Osawatomie Rifles, as it turned out,\r\nwho were milling about and apparently going nowhere. The rain had let up, and\r\nthe men were shaking off their clothes, drying their weapons, and scraping mud\r\nfrom their horses’ shoes. They had built a huge fire, as if they meant to stay\r\nawhile or even overnight, for it was nearly dark by then.\r\nThey were more concerned, it seemed, with organizing themselves into a\r\nregular troop of soldiers than with riding straight on to defend Lawrence from\r\nthe invaders.",
    " John explained to Father that they had lately received\r\ncontradictory reports from Lawrence and wished to wait for further orders\r\nbefore leaving this part of the territory undefended against the numerous bands\r\nof Buford’s Ruffians who had been roaming the region for weeks, threatening to\r\nshoot, hang, and burn Free-Staters. Their first responsibility, he said, was to\r\nprotect the Osawatomie section of the territory, not Lawrence.\r\nThis infuriated Father. He had moved to the wagon, where, to address the\r\ngroup, he stood up on the seat, with Oliver at the reins beside him and the rest\r\nof us on horseback. Earlier, back at the camp, we had loaded the wagon with the\r\nusual sheaf of pikes and sharpened broadswords, and we were armed in addition\r\nwith our Sharps rifles and our revolvers. Though we were but six men, or five\r\nmen and a boy, we had the weaponry of a dozen. “The Missourians are all at\r\nLawrence, burning it down!” the Old Man shouted at John and the others. “It’s\r\nonly you boys and your women and children who are left here!”\r\n“We don’t know that,” John coolly answered.\r\n“Well, then, you’re welcome to stay put until you do!” the Old Man snapped,\r\nand he leapt to the ground and took the bridle of Reliance from me and signaled\r\nfor us to depart. At once, Oliver drew the wagon back onto the muddy road, and\r\nwe headed at a gallop northward across the darkening plain towards Lawrence.\r\nI remember two more meetings out on the road that night, before we went to\r\nPottawatomie and did the terrible things there. The first was a rider who had\r\nbeen sent down to Osawatomie from Lawrence by the Free-State authorities,\r\nColonel Lane and Mr. Robinson.",
    " He was a screw-faced boy of sixteen or\r\nseventeen, his horse all lathered from the long ride, and he at first mistook us for\r\nthe advance contingent of the Osawatomie Rifles and thought that Father was\r\nJohn himself, Lieutenant Brown.\r\n“No, I am Captain Brown;’ Father said to the lad. “His superior officer and his\r\nfather. What news have you?”\r\nThe Osawatomie Rifles, the boy said, were instructed by Colonel Lane to\r\nreturn to their homes and not to come on to Lawrence.\r\n“And why is that?”\r\n“Because it’s all over, sir. No need to come in now, Cap’n Brown. And they\r\nain’t got any food, except barely enough for the folks as is already there.\r\nPresident Pierce’s federal troops are running the entire town,” he said. “They\r\ncome in and parleyed awhile with the Missourians and sent ’em back peaceful.”\r\nThe Free-State leaders, he explained, had decided not to oppose Colonel Buford\r\nand his four hundred Border Ruffians when they first appeared at the edge of\r\ntown, and the Southerners had then proceeded to ride into the town and sack it.\r\nThey had broken up all the printing presses and had gotten drunk on as much\r\nwhiskey as they could find and had burned several stores and even shot the Free-\r\nState Hotel full of holes with a cannon. “But they didn’t kill nobody, Cap’n\r\nBrown. They just did whatever they wanted, and all the folks stood in the street\r\nand watched ’em like it was a circus, and then the Federals come down from\r\nLeavenworth and got ‘em to agree to head back to Atchison.”\r\nThe boy smiled, as if he had brought glad tidings, but his news made Father\r\ncrazy, and when the Old Man drew out his revolver and started waving it\r\naround, I thought he might shoot the boy.",
    " Instead, he leapt down from his horse\r\nand seized the lad by his collar and dragged him off the road a short ways into\r\nthe high grasses, where he shouted into his face that he would put a bullet in the\r\nboy’s head here and now if he was not who he said he was and if what he had\r\ntold us was a lie. “Because it sounds like a perfect lie!” he declared. “Designed to\r\nhold us out of the battle!”\r\nThe boy crumpled to his knees and began to cry, which seemed to soften the\r\nOld Man, or at least to convince him that the boy was not lying, for he holstered\r\nhis gun and lifted the lad to his feet, brushed the mud from his trousers, and\r\nbrought him back to us. Then he instructed him to ride on to where John and\r\nthe Rifles were camped and give them his unfortunate news, which he was sure\r\nthey, at least, would welcome. Glad to be released, the boy mounted his horse\r\nand left us at once.\r\nWe ourselves did not know what to do then. Go on to occupied Lawrence, or\r\nride back to our camp on the Marais des Cygnes, southeast of Osawatomie?\r\nNeither route took us where we had hoped to go, which was straight into the\r\nnoise and smoke of battle. Ride back and pitch our tent with John and his Rifles\r\nand our pacificist brother, Jason? That seemed somehow shameful,\r\nembarrassing, at the least, although none of us said it outright. Our blood was all\r\nheated up; we could feel it coursing down our arms to our hands and pounding\r\nin our necks and ears. Even Oliver, I realized, as I looked up at him on the\r\nwagon box, was caught up in it: his hands were locked in white-knuckled fists,\r\nhis boyish jaw was clenched tight as a vise; and Henry and my brothers Salmon\r\nand Fred, they, too, were poised to ride straight into battle.\r\nFather stood by the wagon alone and breathed heavily in and out, as if re-\r\ngathering his strength, like an ox after a long pull.",
    " Finally, I said to him, “I’m for\r\nriding into Lawrence and finding Colonel Lane and the others who are\r\nresponsible for this betrayal. Then we should take them out and execute them\r\nfor it. Put an end to this constant accommodation.” I meant it and, if Father had\r\nagreed, would have done it. But he did not agree.\r\n“No, no, this is not over yet,” he said. “Keep in mind the story of Joab, who\r\nslew Absalom, causing King David such a lamentation and dividing the Israelites\r\nagainst themselves, which greatly weakened them against their enemies. No,\r\nboys, we must let the Lord decide this.”\r\n“Decide what? Our cause is lost, Father! Lost without even a whimper from\r\nthose cowards in Lawrence, and now the whole territory, it looks like, is ruled by\r\nFranklin Pierce’s soldiers. We’re ruled by Washington turncoats in league with\r\nthe Atchison pro-slavers and Buford’s mob of Southerners.”\r\n“We might yet upset this neat arrangement. Something must be done, though.\r\nSomething dramatic and terrible,” Father said, and when he said that word,\r\n“terrible,” I knew what he meant.\r\n“Who shall we do it to?” I asked. The others—Salmon, Fred, Oliver, and Henry\r\n—were silent and wondering; they did not yet know what Father and I were\r\nspeaking of.\r\n“I guess it’ll have to be the Shermans and the Doyles and so on, the men down\r\non the Pottawatomie!’ he said.\r\n“That’s fine. But we better do it quickly, while the hornets are out of the nest.\r\nDo you think Dutch Sherman and the Doyle men are at home anyhow? They\r\nmight have ridden with Buford’s army.”\r\nFather thought not—they were pro-slave and anti-Negro, all right, and plenty\r\nloud about it, but they were family men and had their land claims already\r\nsettled and had built cabins and weren’t likely to be running with that crowd.\r\n“We will go down there tonight” he said.",
    " “And we shall treat with the men only,\r\nand make quick, bloody work of it, whilst the surrender and the sacking of\r\nLawrence are still in the air, so that everyone in the territory on both sides will\r\nknow why it was done.”\r\nMy brother-in-law, Henry Thompson, then spoke up. “Mister Brown, do you\r\nmean for us to Ml the Shermans and the Doyles?”\r\n“Yes, Henry, I do,” Father replied. “Boys, Owen has seen it straight. After the\r\ndebacle in Lawrence, if we don’t do this, our cause here in Kansas is wholly lost,\r\nand lost without a fight.”\r\n“But do we have to kill these men? They don’t own any slaves. They’re just\r\nloudmouths.”\r\nFred said, “Shut up, Henry! You have to do what Father says. He has spoken\r\nwith the Lord all these years, and you haven’t. It’s what the Lord has told him to\r\ndo.”\r\n“Are these men not our sworn enemies, boys?” Father asked. “Have they not\r\nhundreds of times sworn to kill us?”\r\nThey all four nodded agreement—slowly and reluctantly, however. Henry said,\r\n“But we have never thought they would ever actually do it. I mean, kill us\r\noutright. You know, unless they were provoked or something.”\r\n“This will provoke them,” I said. “Either you’re with us on this, Henry, or\r\nyou’re against us.”\r\n“What about John and Jason?” Salmon asked.\r\n“The choice hasn’t been put to them,” I said. “So they’re neither for nor\r\nagainst.”\r\nFather added that, as officers in the Free-State Militia, John and Jason were\r\nobliged to follow the orders of their superiors, even if their superiors ordered\r\nthem to capitulate to the enemy, which, in a sense, they had already done. As\r\nirregulars, we were not so bound. Besides, John was a member of the Free-State\r\nlegislature and had sworn to uphold the laws of the territory. The only laws we\r\nhad sworn to uphold were the Lord’s.\r\n“And the Lord wants us to do this thing?” Fred asked.\r\n“He does,” Father pronounced.",
    "\r\n“Good,” Fred replied, and the others nodded agreement again, this time with\r\nfirmness.\r\nThis may seem strange to one who was not there on that May night out on the\r\nplain—to us it was apposite and just, and not at all strange—but at that moment,\r\nwhen we had reached our decision to go to the cabins on the Pottawatomie and\r\nkill the men who lived there, a single rider came out of the darkness from the\r\ndirection of Lawrence, bringing news which, although it was awful news, seemed\r\nnonetheless to have been sent by the Lord Himself, sent with no other purpose\r\nthan to give us permission to do this thing and do it now.\r\nOddly, we did not hear him approach, perhaps because our attention was so\r\ntaken up with our wrangle. He seemed to emerge from the darkness like a ghost\r\n—but it was only a man, a man in a long white duster, riding a pale gray\r\nstallion, and although we were startled by his sudden appearance, we were not\r\nfrightened by it, as he seemed to bear us no enmity. We did not know him, had\r\nnever seen him before, and he did not introduce himself or ask who we were. He\r\nwas a tall, well-built man of early middle-age, blond-haired, with a full beard. I\r\nrecall him exactly. He pulled up beside the wagon and touched the broad brim\r\nof his hat with a gloved finger.\r\nWith no further greeting, he said to Father straight out, in an even voice, “You\r\nmay wish to know, sir, that early yesterday it was reported in Saint Louis that\r\nSenator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts was brutally assaulted in the Senate\r\nchamber. You may also wish to know the name of his assailant, Senator Preston\r\nBrooks of South Carolina. The senator from Massachusetts, a strong supporter of\r\nthe abolitionist cause, which I take to be your cause as well, was beaten\r\nunmercifully by the Southerner.",
    " He was clubbed on the head with a stout cane,\r\nand it is very likely that he will not survive the attack.”\r\nI had never seen Father as wild as he was then. He pulled off his hat and threw\r\nit on the ground. His face reddened with rage, and his brow darkened down as if\r\nhis brain were on fire. He lifted his arms into the air and cried, “How can this\r\nbe! How can such a thing happen!”\r\nI said nothing, but the others, too, cried out their shock and anger at this latest\r\noutrage by the slavemasters. Then the messenger, if that is, indeed, what he was,\r\nsaid to us, “I bid you good evening, sirs” and, touching his hat a second time,\r\nrode slowly off, disappearing into the darkness as silently and swiftly as he had\r\ncome.\r\nFor a long while after that, Father and the boys acted crazy, as if trying to\r\noutdo one another in their ranting and their wild promises to avenge this\r\nheinous crime against one of our heroes. I waited until they began to calm\r\nsomewhat, and when I thought they could hear me clearly, I said, “It’s time now\r\nto go down along the Pottawatomie, where we can sharpen our swords and\r\ncommence to use them.”\r\nThat silenced everyone, even Father, who seemed to break out of a trance. He\r\nshook his head violently, as if ridding it of evil spirits or bad dreams, and\r\nsuddenly he was scrambling up on Reliance and shouting for Oliver to get the\r\nwagon moving. He took his own reins in his hands and slapped them against the\r\nflanks of the Morgans. The horses leapt forward, and Oliver was obliged to run\r\nand grasp onto the rear of the box and clamber aboard whilst it was moving.",
    " We\r\nwatched for a minute longer, saying nothing, and then the others, Salmon, Fred,\r\nand Henry, mounted their horses—I had never got down from mine—and we\r\ntook off at a full gallop, chasing after Father and Oliver, the wagon rumbling in\r\nthe darkness ahead of us and ahead even of Father, racing along the rough old\r\nbuffalo-track, the California Road, that led down from the heights of the Ottawa\r\nlands to the winding, narrow Cottonwood valley of the Pottawatomie.\r\nWho can say which event is accidental and which is not? Or even if there exists\r\nsuch a thing as a true accident, a purely causeless event? When you take away\r\nbelief in God’s will, then every untoward event and every blessing is viewed as\r\nmerely the result of history; or else its origin is said to be a mystery; or else we\r\nlamely and with extreme insecurity reason backwards from effect to cause—from\r\nconsciousness of guilt, for instance, backwards to the sinful act. Thus, if my\r\nfeelings of guilt were made a measure of my intention, I have to concede that,\r\neven though I was not aware of it at the time, I nonetheless fully intended to kill\r\nmy beloved friend Lyman Epps and only arranged for it afterwards to resemble\r\nan accident, in my own eyes as much as in the eyes of others. And thus it would,\r\nindeed, be as I felt it (but did not believe it) afterwards—a crime. A murder. By\r\nthe same token, by the weight of guilt, I fully intended to go down there along\r\nthe Pottawatomie Creek that night with my father and brothers and haul five\r\nmen who claimed to love slavery and hate Negroes out of their cabins and\r\nbutcher them for the sheer, murderous pleasure of it. For afterwards that is how\r\nguilty I felt, as if I had done it for the pleasure of it.\r\nBut if events are driven not by a man’s unconscious desires, and not by pure\r\nmystery, and not by some deep, unknown historical force—then what?",
    " After all,\r\nI was not obliged by circumstances or by any other man to go there with my\r\nsword and brandish it the way I did. No, I hold myself responsible for my own\r\nbloody acts. And I believe that I am further responsible, and to nearly the same\r\ndegree, for the bloody acts that night of my father and brothers, too. For without\r\nmy having instigated the attack and then goaded them when they grew timorous\r\nand frightened by the idea, they would not have done it.\r\nSimply, I showed them at the time and afterwards that if we did not slay those\r\nfive pro-slave settlers and did not do it in such a brutal fashion, the war in\r\nKansas would have been over. Finished. In a matter of weeks, Kansas would\r\nhave been admitted to the Union as a slave-state, and there would have been\r\nnothing for it then but the quick secession of all the Northern states, starting\r\nwith New England, and the wholesale abandonment of three million Negro\r\nAmericans to live and die in slavery, along with their children and grandchildren\r\nand however many generations it would take before slavery in the South was\r\nfinally, if ever, overthrown. There would have been no raid on Harpers Ferry,\r\ncertainly, and no Civil War, for the South would not have objected in the\r\nslightest to the break-up of the Union. Let them go. We will happily keep our\r\nslaves.\r\nWhen we went down to the Pottawatomie, I believed all that. And in spite of\r\nmy guilty feelings, I believe it still. No, I swear, I did not go down there for the\r\npleasure of killing my enemies, nor did Father, nor my brothers, despite what\r\nthe writers, North and South, puzzling over the causes of that event, have said in\r\nthe intervening years.",
    " On that dark May night in ’56,1 truly thought that we\r\nwere shaping history, that we were affecting the course of future events, making\r\none set of events nearly impossible and another very likely, and I believed that\r\nthe second set was morally superior to the first, so it was a good and necessary\r\nthing, what we were doing. We could slay a few men now, men who were guilty,\r\nperhaps, if only by association, and save millions of innocents later. That’s how\r\nterror, in the hands of the righteous, works.\r\nAnd we were right, after all. For it did work. The terror and the rage that we\r\ncaused with those murders ignited the flames of war all across Kansas, to be\r\nsure, and all across the Southern states and in the North as well. We turned\r\nKansas bloody. With a single night’s work, we Browns made the whole territory\r\nbleed. The Missourians came flying back across the river determined anew to kill\r\nevery abolitionist in Kansas, and the Northerners were forced to return blow for\r\nblow, until both sides lost sight of the possibilities of a short-term peace and\r\nwere instead engaged in a fight to the death. Which was exactly as Father and I\r\nand, to a lesser degree, the rest of us Browns wanted.\r\nIf we had learned anything over the last decade, it was that there was no other\r\nway to defeat slavery, except with a willingness to die for it. We had learned\r\nwhat the Negroes long knew. And thus we merely did what the Negroes\r\nthemselves had done over and over in the past—in Haiti, in the mountains of\r\nJamaica, and in the swamps of Virginia—but could not do out there on the\r\nplains of Kansas. We did what we wanted the Negroes to do in Kansas.",
    " By\r\nslaying those five pro-slavers on the Pottawatomie that night, we placed\r\nhundreds, thousands, of other white men in the same position that we alone\r\namongst the whites had held for years: for now every white man in Kansas, anti-\r\nslaver and pro-slaver alike, had to be ready to die for his cause.\r\nIf Father wanted to believe that it was the Lord’s will we were enacting, fine. I\r\nhad no argument with him on that, not anymore: out here, living our lives in\r\npublic, what Father called the will of God I now called history. And if history,\r\nlike the will of God, ruled us, then whatever moral dimension it possessed came\r\nnot from itself or from above, but from our very acts, and that it would show us\r\nour true fates, for good or for evil.\r\nThat is why we killed those men.\r\nI remember we drew the wagon into a narrow cleft in the steep, rutted ridge on\r\nthe north side of the trail, with the rain-filled creek below us on the left, the land\r\nclaim and cabin of James Doyle of Tennessee a quarter-mile or so dead ahead,\r\nand the others, Sherman’s and Wilkinson’s, a short ways beyond. It was pitch\r\ndark, but we lit no torches. I instructed the boys and Father to hitch our horses\r\nhere and place our rifles in the wagon and leave them, explaining that, as the\r\nthree cabins we meant to strike were all within a half-mile of one another, we\r\ncould not risk a gunshot. Then I handed out the heavy, razor-sharp broadswords,\r\none to each. No one else spoke a word, not even Father.\r\nBy the time we reached Doyle’s cabin, it was close to midnight, and the clouds\r\nhad broken open, floating across the satiny sky like soldered rags. There was\r\nnow a quarter-moon in the southeast quadrant, casting a shifting, eerie light,\r\nglazing gray the low trees and scrub alongside the trail.",
    " We could see the rough,\r\npale wooden shingles of the roof of the cabin below, when suddenly we heard a\r\nlow growl, and out of the shadows a pair of huge mastiff dogs came charging\r\ntowards us, all fangs and ferocious, yellow eyes. With a single swipe of my\r\nsword I sliced the first animal across its neck and shoulder, and it fell dead at my\r\nfeet, nearly decapitated. Fred struck at the other, injuring it in the haunch,\r\nsending it howling into the woods behind us, away from the cabin.\r\nFather, who had been next to me in the lead, stopped in his tracks. “Ah, we’re\r\ndone for! The Doyles’ll be up and armed now.”\r\n“No,” I said. “Just keep moving fast; don’t hesitate. They’ll likely think the\r\ndogs are chasing deer. Come on!” and I stepped in front of him and jogged down\r\nthe scumbly trail to the front door of the cabin. The shutters were bolted, with\r\nno light visible inside and no sign of life, except for a thick rope of silver smoke\r\nrising from the fireplace chimney. When the others, panting more from\r\nexcitement and fear than from exertion, had arrived at the stoop with me, I\r\nreached forward and banged roughly on the door with the handle of my sword.\r\nA man’s voice inside drawled, “Who’s there? What d’ yer want?”\r\nI looked to Father, whose leathery face had gone white. His cheek twitched,\r\nand his lips were dry and trembling. I was afraid he would not speak to the man;\r\nand I could not. Finally, after a few seconds, the Old Man cleared his throat and\r\nasked in a thin voice the way to Mr. Wilkinson’s cabin. Friend Wilkinson, he\r\ncalled him. Words were Father’s saving grace. I would not have thought to say\r\nthat.",
    "\r\nI heard someone push back a chair and walk across to the door and lift the\r\nbolt away, and when he had opened the door a crack, I kicked it and swiftly put\r\nmy shoulder into it, throwing the door open and tossing the man, James Doyle,\r\nfor that is who it was, back across the tiny room, and we all burst into the cabin,\r\nfilling it completely, sending the Doyles, a family of six people, back against the\r\nfurther wall, where they cowered in fright. They were a dry little old bald-\r\nheaded man, his plump wife, and four children, two of them bearded men in\r\ntheir twenties, the others, a girl and a boy, very small, under fifteen.\r\nThey were frightened and astonished by our sudden, huge presence, and when\r\nFather shouted to Mr. Doyle that we were the Northern Army and had come to\r\ncapture him and his sons, Mrs. Doyle at once commenced to weep, and she cried\r\nto her husband, “I told you what you were going to get! I told you!”\r\n“Hush, Mother!” Mr. Doyle said. “Hush, for God’s sake! This here’s Mister\r\nBrown, ain’t it? From over to Osawatomie. We can reason with him.”\r\nShe wept profusely and for a moment dominated the scene, mainly by begging\r\nFather not to take her son John, who was only fourteen, she said, a mere boy\r\nwith no notion of these things.\r\nFather said to her, “The others, your elder sons, are they members of the Law\r\nand Order Party?”\r\n“Never mind that!” bellowed Old Doyle. “What do you want with us? We ain’t\r\nbut farmers like you, Brown!”\r\n“Thou art the enemies of the Lord,” Father pronounced, and he ordered the\r\ntwo grown sons, named Drury and William, and Old Doyle, the father, to come\r\nout of the house with us, which they did, leaving wife and mother, son and\r\ndaughter, and sister and brother weeping and wailing behind in the doorway, for\r\nthey knew what was about to happen.",
    "\r\nQuickly, we marched the three men, coatless and hatless, back up the narrow,\r\ncurving pathway to the moonlit road. The two younger men were barefoot and\r\nwalked gingerly over the stony trail. Oliver, Fred, and Henry were in front of the\r\nprisoners, Father, Salmon, and I coming along behind, and when we reached the\r\nlevel plain above the creek, a hundred yards or so from the cabin, where the\r\ndead dog lay, Father said to stop now.\r\nOne of the Doyles, William, saw the dog and cried, “Oh, Bonny!”\r\nFather said, “The Law of Moses states that the fathers shall not be killed for\r\nthe crimes of the sons, nor the sons for the crimes of the fathers. But here father\r\nand sons both are guilty.”\r\n“It’s not necessary that they understand what’s happening to them,” I said.\r\n“Let’s just get it done.” I was suddenly afraid that we had come this far and now\r\nthe Old Man would once again end it too soon with palaver and prayer. I\r\nremember raising the blade of my sword over my head with my good right hand,\r\nthe moonlight glinting off its edge like cold fire, and then I brought it down and\r\nburied it in the skull of James Doyle, splashing the son next to him, Drury, with\r\nhis father’s blood. Fred and then Henry Thompson and Salmon joined in and\r\nbegan hacking away at the brothers, chopping them apart at the arms and\r\nslashing them in their chests and bellies, and even Oliver got in some blows with\r\nhis sword. I heard several of us shriek during the slaughter, but I do not know\r\nwhich of us did that, except that it was not I who shrieked, and I remember that\r\nthe Doyles themselves never uttered a single sound, not one cry, but fell silently\r\nto the ground like beeves being butchered in a stockyard. Sinew, muscle, bone,\r\nand blood flew before our eyes; the bodies of our enemies were slashed, cracked,\r\nand broken.",
    " Human beings were sliced open by our swords, and there the\r\ndarkness entered in.\r\nAnd Father? Where was Father? All the while, he stood away from us, and he\r\nalone did not use his sword. He watched. And when we were done with our\r\nmurderous work, when the three Doyles were stilled at last and lying at our feet\r\nin bloody chunks and pieces, making huge puddles of blood on the ground,\r\nFather stepped forward and drew out his pistol. He leaned down and placed the\r\nbarrel against the cloven head of Old Doyle and fired a bullet straight into the\r\nman’s brain, as if into a rotted stump.\r\n“The others will hear that,” I said to him. Oliver was weeping, and Henry, who\r\nsuddenly, in the midst of the killing, had commenced to vomit, was now\r\nhiccoughing violently. The two of them staggered in small circles in the\r\ndarkness, pounding their feet against the hard ground in a slow, furious dance,\r\nwhilst Salmon and Fred stared down at the bodies of the slain men in silence, as\r\nif they had come upon them unexpectedly and did not know how they had died.\r\n“Let them hear it,” Father said. “It will make no difference. Come, boys,” he\r\nsaid, and led us away from the place where we had slain the Doyles, down the\r\ntrail towards the Wilkinson cabin, which was located on the claim adjacent to\r\nDoyle’s, in a grove of old oak and cottonwood trees closer to the creek.\r\nHere the Old Man for the first time took charge completely. He banged on the\r\ndoor, and before anyone inside had a chance to answer, he demanded to know\r\nthe way to Dutch Henry’s cabin, which was widely known as a meeting place for\r\npro-slavery settlers. Someone, presumably Mr. Wilkinson, began to answer, but\r\nFather interrupted and told him to come out and show us the way.\r\nWhen there was no reply, Father waited a moment and then said, “Are you of\r\nthe Law and Order Party?” meaning, was he pro-slavery.",
    "\r\nWilkinson answered forthrightly, “I am, sir!”\r\n“Then you are our prisoner! I order you to open your door to us at once, or we\r\nshall burn the house down around you!”\r\n“Wait! Wait a minute. Let me get a light,” Wilkinson said.\r\nFather replied that he would give him thirty seconds and commenced\r\ncounting, but before he had reached twenty, the door was opened, and we all\r\nmarched inside the cabin. Here, again, there was a terrified wife and four\r\nchildren, all of the children small, however, little more than babies. Wilkinson\r\nwas in his mid-thirties, a tall, gaunt Southerner with a great jaw, standing in his\r\nunderwear and stockinged feet. His wife, also tall and thin, in a flannel\r\nnightgown and cap, stood by the fireplace, with the children huddled close\r\naround her.\r\n“Who are you!” the woman screamed at Father. “Are you the devil? You look\r\nlike the devil!”\r\n“My wife is sick” Mr. Wilkinson said. “Let me stay here with her till morning.\r\nPost a man here, and you can come for me then, when we’ll have someone to\r\ntend the babies for her. We got us a woman coming then.”\r\nFather ignored his drawling pleas. He set Oliver and Fred to search the house\r\nfor weapons, and they quickly turned up a rabbit gun and a powder flask. “Bring\r\nthem with us,” the Old Man said. Salmon and Henry he told to pick up the pair\r\nof saddles that were lying on the floor next to the door and carry them up to the\r\nroad. We were short two saddles, and I had spotted them myself when we\r\nentered the cabin. To Mr. Wilkinson, Father simply said, “Come along now” and\r\nhe pointed the tip of his sword at the man, whose face went rigid at the sight of\r\nit. He made no answer and walked stiff-legged from the cabin, and Father\r\nfollowed.\r\nThe wife called after him, “Dad, you’ll want your boots!”\r\n“He won’t be needing them,” I said.\r\n“What are you going to do to my husband?",
    "” Her deep-set eyes, her small,\r\nround mouth, her nose, her whole face, were all circles inside circles, a great,\r\nconcentric, plaintive whorl that threatened to draw me out of myself and\r\ntowards her, and I stepped backwards as if afraid of her.\r\n“Nothing,” I said. “We ain’t gonna do nothing to him. Just make him our\r\nprisoner.”\r\n“Why? What’s he done?”\r\n“For exchange. We’ll exchange him with the Missourians for one of ours,” I\r\nsaid, and stumbled backwards from the cabin and turned and ran to catch up\r\nwith the others, who had disappeared into the darkness ahead.\r\nBy the time I reached the place where the path joined the main trail, they had\r\nalready killed Mr. Wilkinson, and he lay on the rough ground in a splash of\r\nmoonlight with his throat slashed, a huge, toothless yawn from one side of his\r\nmassive jaw to the other, and he had a great, raw wound on his skull, as if he\r\nhad been scalped by Indians, and one arm had been nearly severed from the\r\ntrunk.\r\n“All right, now,” Father said. “Let’s get on to the Sherman cabin.” He told us to\r\nhide the saddles and the rabbit gun in the brush so we could pick them up later.\r\nBut then Oliver began to cry. “I don’t want to do any more of this!” he wailed.\r\n“I can’t!.”\r\nAs if reminding the Old Man of something he had forgotten, Fred leaned in\r\nclose to Father and said, “He’s not a grown man yet, you know.”\r\nI said, “Maybe Oliver should go back for the wagon and come down along the\r\ntrail, pick up these here saddles and so on, and meet up later with us below.”\r\n“Yes, fine. Do that, Oliver. The rest of you follow me,” Father said, and we\r\nwent from there down to our final stop, the cabin owned by Dutch Sherman, the\r\nMissourian who, of all the pro-slavers settled along the Pottawatomie, was the\r\nmost outspoken and threatening.",
    " It was he whom we had most particularly gone\r\nlooking for that night, and as it turned out, he was the easiest to kill. Not\r\nbecause we hated him more than the others, but because he physically opposed\r\nus, fought us furiously until he was finally dead.\r\nEvidently, he had heard the gunshot from up above, where Father had fired his\r\nrevolver into Mr. Doyle’s head, and had come out to investigate, for we met him\r\nup on the road a short ways from his cabin. Father, Fred, and I were in front,\r\nwith Henry and Salmon trailing behind, and we came upon him suddenly before\r\nhe knew we were there. He was standing by the side of the road, urinating, and\r\nhad not heard us approach. He was a muscular keg of a man, red-faced, with a\r\nbull neck and thick arms, a mustachioed Dutchman of about forty, famous for\r\nhis temper. We threw down on him with our swords and Father’s revolver, and\r\nFather said that we were capturing him for the Northern Army. “You are our\r\nprisoner, sir.”\r\nHe buttoned himself up slowly, methodically, and glared at us, all the while\r\nmuttering in his hard accent, “So it’s you damned Bible-thumping Browns, is it?\r\nYou are worse than the niggers. You are a bunch of god-damn Yankee trash\r\ncome down here for stealing our niggers and our horses and then to go off\r\nfeeling all good for it. You are a pack of god-damn hypocrites, coming around\r\nhere in the dead of night like this for robbing a man and to terrorize him. Tell\r\nme what in the hell do you think you are doing!”\r\nWhen Father answered, “The only thing we’re robbing you of tonight is your\r\nlife,” Mr. Sherman understood the dire situation he was in, and he went wild. He\r\nexploded in fury, grabbing the barrel of Father’s revolver with one hand and\r\npunching him repeatedly in the face with the other.",
    " He was very strong, and\r\nwhen Father could not get the weapon loose of his grip or protect himself from\r\nhis pummeling fist, I was obliged to bring my sword into play and, with a single\r\nstroke, severed the man’s hand at the wrist. Both hand and revolver fell to the\r\nground. He howled in pain and rage and charged at me with his head lowered\r\nand butted me in the face, bloodying my nose and knocking me backwards onto\r\nthe ground. With his remaining hand, he grabbed my dropped sword and swung\r\nit like a scimitar in a wide circle, clearing a space to stand in and hold us at bay.\r\nHis severed hand lay on the ground, and his chopped wrist sprayed blood,\r\ndraining him white, yet still he staggered in a circle, flailing the sword at us,\r\ncausing us to leap back from him and look for an opening to take him down\r\nwithout being injured by him. I had scrambled back to my feet, my face covered\r\nwith blood, and when I saw Father’s revolver lying on the ground next to Mr.\r\nSherman’s hand, I darted over to it, grabbed the weapon, and, from a crouching\r\nposition, looked up into the maddened face of Dutch Sherman looming over me.\r\nHis sword, my dropped sword, was about to come down on my head. At the\r\nsame instant as I shot the man in the chest, Henry caught him from behind\r\nacross the mid-section with his sword, and Fred sank his sword into the man’s\r\nshoulder. He was dead before he hit the ground.\r\nNo one said a word for a long time after that. Void of feeling and thought, we\r\nstumbled down to the creek and washed our swords and our hands and faces in\r\nthe cold water and waited there, seated on the rocks, for Oliver to arrive with\r\nthe wagon. Each of us had withdrawn to a chamber deep inside his head and\r\nhad locked himself in there alone.",
    " When, after about an hour, Oliver still had not\r\ncome, Father abruptly got up and walked back along the road a ways to Dutch\r\nSherman’s cabin and soon returned, leading a pair of Mr. Sherman’s horses,\r\nbridled and saddled. So we would be called horse-thieves, as well as murderers,\r\nassassins, cold-blooded executioners. He gave the reins to Salmon and Henry and\r\nin a somber, low voice instructed them to ride back along the ridge and see if\r\nanything had befallen Oliver.\r\nBut just then we heard the familiar sound of the wagon creaking down the\r\nroad towards the creek, and a moment later it appeared, with Oliver looking\r\nterrified and aghast. He had passed all the sites of our killings, had observed the\r\nmangled corpses on the ground from his seat up on the wagon, and the bloody\r\nspectacle of it had changed him.\r\nFather said to Oliver, “Are you all right, son?”\r\n“I feel dead,” he said in a flat, cold voice.\r\n“I feel like I’m dead.” “Then you are all right. You can’t feel otherwise, son,\r\nafter a thing like this. There will be no more of it, I promise thee,” he said, and\r\nclimbed up onto the wagon and took the reins. Fred and I climbed up behind\r\nSalmon and Henry on the stolen horses, and the six of us quickly rode out of that\r\nghastly place, heading southeast from the Pottawatomie creek-bottom to where\r\nwe had left our horses tied, and thence on to our camp on the Marais des\r\nCygnes.\r\nBefore us, the darkness had faded from the night sky, and we traveled over the\r\ntall-grass plain beneath a pale blue canopy. The moon had set, and the last stars,\r\nlike silver nails, had pinned the canopy overhead. Behind us in the east, the\r\nrising sun would soon crack the black, flat line of the horizon. There long,\r\nragged strips of silver-blue clouds lay banked in tiers, tinged with red, as if the\r\nheavens were bleeding.\r\nLet them bleed, I thought.",
    " Let the heavens rain down on us in gob– bets and\r\npour rivers of blood over the earth. Let the sky bleed all its color out, and let the\r\nearth be covered over with gore—I no longer care.\r\nLet the soil here below stink and turn to a scarlet muck, and let us crawl\r\nthrough it until our mouths and nostrils fill with it and we drown in it with our\r\nhands on each other’s throats—I no longer resist this war. I relish it.\r\nChapter 19\r\nDear Miss Mayo, I have again, as it were, mislaid you: days, weeks, possibly\r\nwhole months, have passed without my clocking them, whilst I’ve scribbled\r\naway at this, my long-withheld confession, page after page. And when I have\r\nfinished covering yet another page or chapter of it, I reach for a fresh sheet of\r\npaper or an unused tablet, and finding none at hand, I write on the backs of old,\r\nfilled sheets (which once again I realize that I have somehow neglected to send\r\nto you), and I go on setting down my tale in the margins and even between the\r\nlines of passages that, for all I know, I must have written to you sometime last\r\nspring or winter—passages, pages, entire tablets that, in my urgency to continue\r\nwriting, I have elbowed to the edge of my little table and have let get lost\r\namongst the pages and tablets previously heaped there and that now slowly\r\ntumble to the floor. They clutter there at my feet and pile like autumn leaves\r\nand scatter and drift across this dim room in the cold winds sifting through the\r\ncracks in the walls of my cabin and blowing beneath its flimsy door.\r\nI have gotten lost inside my confession, as if it were my very self—my only\r\nremaining self. I am alive, oh, yes, but my life is long over, and thus I am no\r\nmore now than these words, sentences, episodes, and chapters of my past.",
    " Yet\r\nfrom time to time, at moments such as this, I do rise, like an old, befuddled bear\r\nwho wakes reluctantly from hibernation and breaks off his unbroken, winter-\r\nlong dream, and I stumble blinking from the cave of my narration into blinding\r\nsunlight, where suddenly, forcibly, I recall the now long-past occasion and need\r\nthat brought me in the first place a willingness to speak of these things. Which is\r\nto say, I remember thee, Miss Mayo, way out East in New York City, poring with\r\nsteady perseverance over the hundreds of accounts of Father’s life and the\r\nnumerous interrogatories that you have no doubt taken from the still-living men\r\nand women who knew us back before the War and whose tattered memories,\r\nthough rent and shot through with age, provide them, and now you and\r\nProfessor Villard, with varying versions of the same events that I dreamed\r\nclearly in my cave, as clearly as if they actually occurred there, and that I have\r\nbeen setting down for, lo, these many, unnumbered months.\r\nBut I do remember thee, Miss Mayo, and my promise to compose for you my\r\nown account and place it safely into your hands, so that you in turn can aid and\r\nadvise the distinguished Professor Villard in his composition of what you and he\r\nsurely hope will become the final biography of John Brown. And if I have been\r\ntoo distracted and confused and enfeebled, if I have been too disembodied by the\r\nact of telling this tale, to sort and order these pages and arrange to have them\r\nplaced into your hands somehow, if, in other words, I have been too much a\r\ngarrulous ghost and too little a proper respondent, then I apologize, Miss Mayo,\r\nand ask your forgiveness and understanding, for there is no other way for me to\r\nhave told what I have already told and to say what I have yet to say.",
    " For though\r\na man trapped in purgatory, if he would escape it, may seem betimes to speak to\r\nthe living, he speaks, in fact, only to the dead, to those who in hurt confusion\r\nsurround him there, awaiting his confession to set them free.\r\nThese things which I alone know—of the death of Lyman Epps and of the\r\nbrutal massacre down by the Pottawatomie and the turbulent, bloody events that\r\nfollowed, of the climactic raid on Harpers Ferry and the martyrdom of my father\r\nand the cold execution of my brothers and our comrades—these things, when I\r\nhave finished telling them, will not alter history. They will not revise the\r\nreceived truth. That truth is shaped strictly by the needs of those who wish to\r\nreceive it. No, when I have said them, the things that I alone know will release\r\nfrom purgatory the souls of all those men whom I so dearly loved and who went\r\nto their deaths believing that they held their fates in their own hands and that\r\nthey had chosen in the fight against slavery to slay other men and to die for it.\r\nWhen I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. But I\r\nam no longer silent. I am saying that those men did not so choose. I chose for\r\nthem. Their fates were in my hands alone.\r\nThere is much, of course, that I am leaving out of my account, much that need\r\nnot be told here by me. Most of what happened back then occurred in full public\r\nview, anyhow, and is known to the world; it needs no corrective from me: I’m\r\nnot writing a history of those years or a biography of my father. I leave those\r\nhigh tasks to you and the professor. I have neither the mind nor the training for\r\nthem, nor the inclination.",
    " As for the wider events across the nation and in\r\nWashington during those years, when the slaveholding South like a gigantic\r\nserpent slowly wrapped the rest of the Republic in its suffocating coils: I leave to\r\nothers the obligation to set straight that record; and for the most part they have\r\nalready done so, the journalists, the historians and biographers, the memoirists,\r\nand so on. The fact that nearly all of us then engaged in the war against slavery\r\nbelieved in the late ’50s that the war was all but lost, that much today, if little\r\nnoted by the world, is nonetheless collected and recorded there. I needn’t\r\nrecount these highly visible public events, although I do wish you to know how,\r\nover time, they made us believe that our entire government and even our\r\nnation’s destiny itself had been stolen from us, as if we had been invaded and all\r\nbut conquered by a foreign, tyrannical power.\r\nWe were enraged by this, to be sure, and howled at it, but when the slavery-\r\nloving, Negro-hating mobs gathered legitimacy in Washington and in the\r\nSouthern press, when the Border Ruffians were portrayed as legitimate settlers\r\nand the overseers of human chattel as statesmen, when our leaders, like Senators\r\nDouglas and Webster, sold us out for a handful of silver coins and our heroes,\r\nlike Senator Sumner, were clubbed down in the Capitol building itself, our rage\r\nturned suddenly to cold desperation. We who early on had been merely anti-\r\nslavery activists and who, slowly over the years in defense of our own rights of\r\nprotest, had evolved, almost unbeknownst to ourselves, into guerilla fighters and\r\nmilitiamen—we now became terrorists. And having become terrorists, we found\r\nourselves almost overnight made emblematic to those remaining white activists\r\nwho mostly sat in their parlors or at their desks grieving over the loss of their\r\nnation.",
    " We inspired them, and they encouraged us. And so we waged their war\r\nfor them. Unwilling to do more to regain their nation than write a poem or a\r\ncheque to help arm, clothe, and feed us, they were often objects of scorn and\r\nderision to us, although we were, of course, grateful for their poems and monies\r\nand used both to solicit still more monies and, with our purses thus fattened,\r\npurchased more Sharps rifles, more horses and supplies, more of the terrorizing\r\nbroadswords and pikes.\r\nAh, but you know all this. You are an educated woman, who has sat for years at\r\nthe foot of a wise and learned historian, a man whom I know also by reputation\r\nas the illustrious grandson of William Lloyd Garrison. The grandsire, of course, I\r\nwas myself, through Father, personally acquainted with, and his nobility of\r\npurpose and great personal courage I hope I have not impugned in these pages.\r\nIt’s just that, in the heat of battle and in the face of imminent death, I habitually\r\nbore towards Mr. Garrison and most of the other white abolitionists my father’s\r\nlong-held resentment and impatience. And even today, these many years after, it\r\nstill rankles that, whilst I and my family and our comrades were laying about in\r\nKansas with our broadswords, bloodying ourselves and our enemies and putting\r\nat ultimate risk our lives and our immortal souls, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Emerson, Mr.\r\nWhittier, and all those other good men and women back in Boston and Concord\r\nand New York were adjusting their sleeves so as not to spot their starched cuffs.",
    "\r\nI hear you protest, and I apologize; I concede: it was not the fault of those\r\ngood men that we risked our lives and butchered the men and boys down on the\r\nPottawatomie and in the ensuing several years raised homicidal havoc across the\r\nKansas plain and even into Missouri itself, or that later we marched into\r\nmartyrdom in Virginia; these things we did, not because others did not, but\r\nbecause we ourselves almost alone could not bear to see the war against slavery\r\ncome to an end there. Out there on the old California trail, we understood what\r\nno one else in the country could have known, not in Boston or New York or\r\nWashington or even in the capitals of the South. We were on the battlefront, and\r\nthat night in May of ’56, with the news of the abject sack and surrender of the\r\ntown of Lawrence to the Border Ruffians still drumming in our ears and barely\r\nhours later the sudden arrival of word of the near assassination of Senator\r\nSumner in Washington, we believed that the war was all but over and done with.\r\nOn that night, we saw Satan settle comfortably into his seat and commence to\r\ngather his slaveholding minions in to serve and honor him.\r\nThough it’s not my intention here to explain or excuse our acts, mine or\r\nFather’s or those of any who followed us, I do want you to understand that we\r\nwere desperate men. And of all of us, I suppose I was the most desperate. We\r\nwere made so, me especially, by three inescapable realities: our position on the\r\nground out there in Kansas; the clarity of Father’s understanding of the true\r\nnature and scale of the war against slavery; and our principles. We could not be\r\nwhere we were, know what we knew, uphold what we honored—and do other\r\nthan we did.",
    " And joining us were other men for whom these same three\r\ncircumstances applied as well: not many, a dozen, twenty, usually one at a time\r\nand on occasion arriving in groups of three or four, but enough of them quickly\r\ncame forward and joined our band, especially after Pottawatomie, that we were\r\nbefore long no longer a small, guerilla force made up only of Old Brown and his\r\nsons but an actual, insurrectionary army that was well-armed and was growing\r\nrapidly in size and fearsomeness.\r\nSometimes as many as fifty men, sometimes as few as ten, we stayed on\r\nhorseback day and night almost continuously and, all that summer and into the\r\nnext year, conducted swift, daring, terroristic raids against the Border Ruffians\r\nand their supporters amongst the settlers, moving our encampment every few\r\ndays from one tree-shrouded river-bottom to another. We burnt down the cabins\r\nand barns of the enemy and liberated their property, their horses and cattle and\r\nsupplies and weapons, and although some men, even amongst our allies, called it\r\nlooting or simple horse-stealing, for us it was merely a necessary and legal\r\ncontinuation of our war policy, for it weakened our enemy on the field and\r\nfrightened him everywhere, whilst us it strengthened and our allies it\r\nencouraged.\r\nDuring this period, dozens of journalists came out from the East by way of St.\r\nLouis, Leavenworth, and Lawrence, or down from Iowa to Topeka, and entered\r\nthence into the war region of southeastern Kansas. The more intrepid among\r\nthem, like Mr. Redpath and Mr.",
    " Hinton, would eventually make their way to the\r\nmarshes and ravines and the cottonwood groves along the Marais des Cygnes\r\nand the Pottawatomie or out onto the high, grassy plains of the old Ottawa\r\nReserve, where they would find and follow our band for a few days or a week\r\nuntil, exhausted by the pace of our steady marches and raiding and by Father’s\r\nnight-long monologues and preachments, they would head back to Lawrence or\r\nTopeka and dispatch back to the East vivid accounts of Old Brown’s\r\nindefatigable and brilliant campaign against the pro-slavery forces. Soon they\r\nhad made him a heroic figure out of some old romance, like a legendary Scottish\r\nHighlands chieftain leading his doughty clansmen against the British invader,\r\nand by summer’s end his name was on the lips of nearly every American, North\r\nand South. To all, he had become a figure perfectly expressive of the antislavery\r\nprinciple.\r\nAnd naturally, as his fame spread across the nation, brave, reckless, principled\r\nyoung men itching for battle began to join our ranks.",
    " You know the names and\r\nreputations of many of the best of them, I’m sure, for they were later with us at\r\nHarpers Ferry and entered history there: the fierce, intelligent, and well-spoken\r\nJohn Kagi; and the kindly, black-eyed giant, Aaron Stevens; and poor John Cook,\r\nwho was a genial man but dangerously indiscreet; and Charlie Tidd from Maine,\r\na man with a terrible temper but withal an almost feminine sweetness; and\r\nJeremiah Anderson, the guilty grandson of Virginia slaveholders; and young Will\r\nLeeman, barely seventeen when he first showed up at our camp: these men and\r\nnumerous others whose names and fates you know were with us, but also over\r\ntime a hundred more, who were just as steadfast and brave and who remain\r\nnameless, they were with us, too, and sometimes fell in battle and ended in\r\nunmarked graves or beneath humble, forgotten, untended wooden plaques in an\r\novergrown Kansas field or back yard—farmers, carpenters, and clerks, they all,\r\nin their churches and meeting houses in Ohio and New York and New England,\r\nheard about Old Brown and his men or they read about us in their newspapers,\r\nand they dropped their hoes and spades or put aside their pens and eye-shades\r\nand, like the Minutemen of their grandfathers’ generation, picked up their rifles\r\nand made their way west and south to Kansas, where they got passed along, one\r\nto the other, by our growing number of supporters and allies, until they finally\r\none morning walked through the trees into our camp and presented themselves\r\nto the lean, leathery old man seated by the fire going over his maps, the\r\nlegendary John Brown himself.",
    "\r\nThere were, of course, some young men of a quarrelsome and wasting nature\r\nwho joined us and stayed awhile as regulars in our Army of the North, as Father\r\nsometimes called his force, men who were taints and whose reckless, violent\r\nbehavior caused many amongst the antislavery residents of Lawrence and\r\nTopeka and even back East privately to condemn our work, despite the\r\ncontinuous hosannas in the press. These were fellows who could not keep the\r\npledge they made against the use of alcohol and tobacco or would not subject\r\ntheir wills to Father’s and would have been more at home in the bands of\r\nmarauding Border Ruffians or brawling with each other in the saloons and\r\nmuddy alleyways of the shabby border towns along the Missouri River. They did\r\nnot last long with us. If Father or I found one of them drunk or if, on his or my\r\ncommand, a man did not at once rise from his blankets and mount up with the\r\nothers at midnight and ride out in the cold rain to make a dawn raid on a pro-\r\nslaver’s farmstead twenty miles away on Ottawa Creek, Father was fiercely\r\nadamant and had me drive the man from camp like a dog.\r\nI spoke for Father in all matters, except when he chose to speak for himself,\r\nwhich occasions were rare and made all the more impressive by their rarity.\r\nEven my brothers Salmon and Fred and Oliver and my brother-in-law Henry\r\nThompson addressed Father through me, and it was through me that he spoke\r\nback to them and to the other men. To the journalists, of course, he spoke for\r\nhimself, for no one, certainly not I, was as articulate and clear and poetical as he\r\nwhen it came to defining and justifying his grand strategy.",
    " With his actions in\r\nKansas, Father wished to inspire a similar set of actions by other men all along\r\nthe thousand-mile border between the North and the South, from Maryland to\r\nMissouri: by his and our example, he wished to make warriors of abolitionists\r\nand freedmen, and insurrectionists of slaves.\r\nYour researches must have made known to you by now that after the night of\r\nthe Pottawatomie Massacre, as it quickly came to be called, my elder brothers,\r\nJohn and Jason, were no longer with us. They were not purged from our band\r\nby Father, however; they took themselves from it. And it was just as well for\r\nthem and for us, for they were not cold enough.\r\nWhen, on that morning in May, we had finally washed all the blood from our\r\nhands and faces and had cleaned our broadswords in the waters of the\r\nPottawatomie, we then came somberly, silently away from Dutch Sherman’s\r\nplace, ascending from the dark, gloomy river-bottom in the wagon and on\r\nhorseback along the winding, northerly trail to the grassy plateau above. Swaths\r\nof ground-fog hovered over the trees in the distance, where the Marais des\r\nCygnes meandered eastward towards the town of Osawatomie, and the tall\r\ngrasses glistened in the morning sunlight. We came over into the open, newly\r\ngreen meadows and leafy copses outside the settlement and after a while arrived\r\nat the crossroads where John and Jason and the Osawatomie Rifles still lay\r\nencamped, waiting for instructions from their superiors in Lawrence.\r\nThe men of John’s outfit were mostly young fellows, husbands and sons,\r\nOsawatomie homesteaders mustered abruptly into a militia company to defend\r\nand protect their homes against the Missouri marauders. Thus they could not\r\nhave joined us in our work anyhow and still retained their commission under\r\nColonel Lane and Mr. Robinson.",
    " It was not that Father had mistrusted them,\r\nespecially John and Jason; it was merely that he respected their charge and\r\nmission and knew its difference from ours.\r\nOur arrival at their encampment that morning, however, was met with grim\r\nsilence by them, which puzzled us. They were mostly standing together near\r\ntheir low, smoky breakfast fire, and as we drew near, they watched us and said\r\nnothing and did not even raise a hand in greeting. It was as if we were a\r\npainting of six travelers, three on horseback and three in a wagon, being hung\r\non a wall in a museum, and they were a group of silent, thoughtful observers\r\nstanding ready to examine it. I remember, as we neared the fire and dismounted,\r\nthat it was Jason who first separated himself from the men and came forward,\r\nwhile John looked on woefully, and the others merely gazed coolly in our\r\ndirection as if from a great distance.\r\nJason glanced over the horses and saddles we had taken from Mr. Wilkinson,\r\nthen abruptly took Father’s hand in his and led him a short ways off. I followed,\r\nwhile the other boys stayed in an isolated knot by the wagon.\r\nJason said to Father, “Did you have anything to do with that killing over to\r\nDutch Henry’s Crossing?”\r\nFather looked surprised by the question. “What’ve you heard?”\r\n“A few hours ago, just after sunup, one of the boys from over there rode\r\nthrough, all distraught and weeping in a panic,” he said. “We got out of him that\r\nhis father and two brothers and some other men had been savagely murdered.\r\nHe said they’d all been chopped down by swords and cut horribly. It was an\r\nuncalled-for, wicked act!” he pronounced. Then he looked down at the\r\nbroadsword I wore on my belt and was briefly silent. “The lad was pretty\r\nconfused,” he went on, turning back to Father. “But he claimed it was the\r\nBrowns that did it. He was clear on that. Then he rode on to Osawatomie.",
    " To\r\nraise the alarm.”\r\nWe were all three silent then. At last, Jason said, “Did you do it, Father?”\r\n“I slew no one,” Father declared. “But I do approve of it.”\r\n“I’ll go the route for you, Father, if you’re innocent. But if you did this, you\r\nknow I can’t defend you. It’s a despicable act. I must know where you and the\r\nboys have been all night.”\r\nFather said simply, “No, Jason, you don’t.”\r\nJason looked at me then. “Do you know who did this?”\r\nI hardened my face and showed him its side. “Yes, I do. But I shan’t tell you.”\r\nHis voice lowered almost to a whisper, Jason said, “This is mad.” Then,\r\nharshly, he shouted towards the wagon, “Fred, come over here!”\r\nFred obeyed and came forward and stood beside me with his head hung low,\r\nand at once he said to Jason, “I didn’t do it, but I can’t tell you who did. When I\r\ncame to see what manner of work it was, I couldn’t do it, Jason!” Tears were\r\nstreaming down his face.\r\n“You realize that now we’re all going to suffer!” Jason said to Father. “Do you\r\nrealize that?”\r\n“No, you’re wrong” said Father. “Those men were the enemies of the Lord, and\r\nthey deserved to die, no matter who did it. For without the shedding of blood,\r\nthere is no remission of sins. I will tell you this much, son: I myself killed no one.\r\nBut if the slavers think I killed their kith and kin, that’s fine by me. All the better.\r\nNow they will know our extremity. Now they will know what they’re up\r\nagainst,” he said.\r\nBut Jason was no longer listening. He had stepped unsteadily away a few\r\npaces, and he turned and, nearly staggering, walked off from us and the men of\r\nthe militia.",
    "\r\nThe sight of him, shocked and clearly appalled, pointedly separating himself\r\nfrom Father and me and Fred and making his way along a zig-zag path over the\r\nrise and down the ravine towards the river, told the others that the boy’s dawn\r\naccount had been true, and it seemed to release the men. At once, they busied\r\nthemselves with breaking camp and bridling and saddling their horses. A few\r\nseconds later, John was left standing alone by the fire—a captain overthrown\r\nand abandoned.\r\nHe looked first at us and then at his men, then back at us again, as if torn and\r\ndismayed by the choice that had been forced upon him. Finally, he called out to\r\nhis men, who were mostly already on horseback by now and were clearly\r\nprepared to depart: “Wait up! Hold up a minute! This business isn’t settled yet.\r\nYou fellows are still under my command.”\r\nHenry Williams, a storekeeper in Osawatomie, a big-shouldered man with a\r\ndark, rubbishy beard, said, “No, we’re electing us a new captain, John. We ain’t\r\nriding under no Brown.” The others nodded and murmured agreement, and Mr.\r\nWilliams turned in his saddle and said to them, “Who d’ you boys want for a\r\ncaptain? Any nominations?”\r\nOne of them said, “You’d do fine, Henry.”\r\nAnother man, a tall, raw-boned man in a canvas duster, said, “My vote’s for\r\nWilliams. He’s got sense. And he’s got family and his store to protect. He ain’t\r\ngoing to do anything so stupid as killing off folks at random,” and he glared first\r\nat Father and me and then directly at John.\r\nJohn said, “I’ve got family.”\r\n“Yes;” the man said, “so you do,” and he turned his horse and rode out from\r\nthe camp, onto the crossing.\r\nMr. Williams said, “Listen, Browns, if I was one of you, Id find me a hole and\r\nstay in it till winter. Then maybe I’d light on out of Kansas and go back to the\r\nstates. All across the territory now there’s going to be hell to pay.",
    " You damned\r\nBrowns,” he declared, “you’re plain crazy. Even you, John. Jason, too. I like you\r\nand him well enough, but your name is Brown, and we can’t be under you no\r\nmore. Not now,” he said, and clicked to his horse and went out from the camp to\r\nthe crossing. There he took his place at the head of the gathering column of men,\r\nand when they were arranged in a military line, he led the troop down the road\r\ntowards Osawatomie.\r\nSoon they were gone from sight, and we could no longer hear their hoofbeats.\r\nA crow circled overhead and cawed. Seconds later, another crow appeared\r\nbeside it, and the two carved wide loops against the cloudless sky. Shortly, Jason\r\nreturned from the river-bottom, looking aghast and pale, as if he had been\r\ngazing at the corpses of the five men we had slain barely three hours and five\r\nmiles away from here. Fred moved back towards the wagon. John had not\r\nspoken once yet to Father or stepped from his spot by the dying fire.\r\nFather put a hand on my arm and said, “What d’ you thinks best now, son?”\r\n“Attack.”\r\n“You think so, eh?”\r\n“Worst thing we could do is what Mister Williams said, hide in a hole. We’re\r\ninstruments of the Lord, are we not? So let the Lord lead us. To teach when it is\r\nunclean and when it is clean: this is the law,’“ I quoted to him.\r\nHe made a small smile. “And if the plague be in the walls of the house!” he\r\ncame back, “‘then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in\r\nwhich the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the\r\ncity.’“\r\n“Should we be stones cast out? When we can be the priest’s men, instead?”\r\nFather nodded, and then he called to Salmon, Oliver, Fred, and Henry, who\r\nleaned by the wagon. “Mount up, boys. We’re riding on over by Middle Creek a\r\nways.”\r\n“What for?” Salmon asked.\r\n“To find us a camp where we can rest in peace a day.”\r\n“What then?",
    "” Henry wanted to know.\r\n“Then we’ll see some action. From here on out, we’re going to be on the\r\nattack, boys.”\r\nJason sat down heavily on a nearby log and, placing his forehead against his\r\nknees, wrapped his head with his arms, as if hiding his father and brothers from\r\nhis sight and hearing. John remained standing by the dwindled fire, all\r\ndisconsolate and downcast.\r\nI said to him, “You coming?”\r\nHe shook his head no.\r\n“Suit yourself,” I said. “Jason?”\r\nHe didn’t answer.\r\n“You boys maybe ought to think about moving your wives and Tonny\r\npermanently into town or down to Uncle’s place!’ I told them. “It’s going to start\r\ngetting plenty hot around here now,” I said, and climbed up on the wagon seat\r\nnext to Oliver. Father had mounted Reliance and was out in front of the wagon.\r\n“Okay, Father,”I said to him. “Let’s move.”\r\nHe nodded, and we rode off across a broad, high meadow north– west of the\r\ncrossroad, away from our old settlement at Browns Station, away from the town\r\nof Osawatomie, away from poor John and Jason. I remember I turned in the\r\nwagon and peered back at them, and my elder brothers were standing with their\r\narms around each other, as if both men were weeping and trying to console one\r\nanother.\r\nI did not think then that what later happened to John and Jason would occur,\r\nbut when it did, I was not surprised. By then, Father, Old Brown, had become\r\nthe feared and admired Captain John Brown of Kansas, had become Osawatomie\r\nBrown, the victor of the Battle of Black Jack, the one nationally known hero of\r\nthe Kansas War, and he was back in Boston, working his way across the entire\r\nNortheast, raising funds and making speeches to thunderous applause. And\r\nthrough it all, from that May day forward, the cold, silent man at his side, the\r\nlarge, red-bearded fellow with the gray eyes who spoke to no one but to Captain\r\nBrown himself, was me.",
    " My two elder brothers had been all but removed from\r\nFather’s life, and I had replaced them there.\r\nChapter 20\r\nI’m trying to recall it: how I came to be knocking at the rough plank door of\r\nUncle Sam Adair’s cabin in the nighttime; and when exactly it occurred, that\r\nsame night or the next. Things happened so quickly back then that, although I\r\ncan with ease summon them to my mind in sharp, vivid detail, sometimes their\r\nsequence blurs. But I do know that it was right after we had made our first secret\r\ncampsite over on Middle Creek in amongst a clutch of black oak trees, and had\r\nslept awhile and rested our animals and prepared our weapons for battle, that I\r\nwent to my uncle’s cabin. I have no diary at hand, for none of us kept one, and\r\nof course I have no calendar from those days. But I do remember that, towards\r\nthe end of our first night in camp, while the others were sleeping, on Father’s\r\norders I rode one of Dutch Sherman’s liberated horses out to the Osawatomie\r\nRoad, intending to slip into town under cover of darkness to be sure that Jason’s\r\nwife, Ellen, and John’s Wealthy and little Tonny were safely ensconced with\r\nfriends there.\r\nYes, it was not until the second night that I made it over to the Adair cabin.\r\nFor, when we had first got to Middle Creek, the boys, Oliver, Salmon, Fred, and\r\nHenry Thompson, were exhausted—oddly so, it seemed to me, despite the fact\r\nthat we had all been awake for nearly forty hours straight, for Father and I were\r\nnot in the slightest fatigued. Quite the opposite: he and I were exhilarated and\r\nfilled with new and growing plans and stratagems for raiding and terrorizing the\r\nBorder Ruffians and pro-slave settlers. The boys, though, were all but useless, at\r\nleast for a while, until they could begin to put the killings behind them.",
    " Fred\r\nwept, and he declared again and again that he could not stand to do any more\r\nwork such as that, and Oliver wrapped himself in his blanket on the ground and\r\nwould not speak to any one of us, while Salmon and Henry huddled together and\r\nread in their Bibles.\r\nFather sat on the ground beside Fred and said to him, “God will forgive thee,\r\nson. I have prayed and listened with all my mind and heart to the Lord, and I\r\nknow that we have done His will in this business. You can let your conscience\r\nrest, son” he said, and stroked poor Fred and comforted him tenderly, while I\r\nwent to the other boys and made my rough attempt to do the same, although\r\nthey were not inclined to be comforted by me or Father and in a listless way said\r\nfor us to just leave them be, they were tired and wished only to sleep.\r\nSo while the others slept or sulked or read, Father and I busied ourselves\r\nthroughout the afternoon into the evening, constructing a crude lean-to of brush\r\nand a corral for the horses; and after dark, when we dared finally to set a small\r\nfire, we made a little wicker weir and caught and cooked us some small fish\r\nfrom the creek and ate and talked in low voices until late. Father was worried, I\r\nremember, about the women and Tonny, his only grandson, and when I\r\nvolunteered to go into town to be sure they were safe, he at first said no, it was\r\ntoo dangerous, but I persisted, and finally he relented and gave the order. He\r\nsaid he would write some letters and send them with me and that I should try to\r\nget them to Uncle Sam Adair, his brother-in-law, for posting. “I want to have my\r\nown say-so on this business,” he said. “To get the truth out, before folks hear\r\nerroneous reports of it first. I don’t want the family at home fearing for our lives.\r\nOr for our souls, either;’ he added.",
    "\r\nI agreed and said that I would also try to speak with John and Jason, to see if\r\nthey would now change their minds and come in with us, for we would be much\r\nstronger with them than we were without. “True. True enough,” Father said.\r\n“But remember, son, it’s we who have made the blood sacrifice. They haven’t.\r\nThis war’s no longer the same for us as it is for them.”\r\nI asked if he thought they might betray us, for Jason was at bottom pacifistic\r\nand John a political man, but he assured me they would not: he had asked the\r\nLord how he should treat with them, and the Lord had told him to trust all his\r\nsons equally. “The Lord saith, ‘Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none\r\nof them is lost but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.’” He\r\noften spoke of the Lord in this familiar way, for it was around this time that\r\nFather had begun his practice, later much commented upon, of withdrawing\r\nfrom camp to commune alone with God, more or less in the manner of Jesus, for\r\nlong hours at a time, returning to us clear-eyed and energetic, full of intention\r\nand understanding. I can’t say what that was like for him, whether he was\r\nduring those hours an actual mystic or was merely deep in solitary prayer, but\r\nthe practice brought him a piercing clarity and a regularly freshened sense of\r\npurpose, which suited my private desires ideally, so I did not question it.\r\n“You may ask them if they wish to join us here under my command,” he told\r\nme. “But don’t press them on it, Owen. I don’t want to force them into choosing\r\nagainst us. A time will come,” he said, “when events and the cruelties of men will\r\nbring them over on their own, and when that happens, John and Jason will\r\nprove our strongest allies.",
    "”\r\nHe drew out his writing kit and for an hour or so was absorbed in writing\r\nseveral letters, one to Mary and the children in North Elba, I later saw, and\r\nothers to Frederick Douglass and Gerrit Smith, and hurried me out of camp then,\r\ninstructing me to return quickly, for we would now be obliged to return to\r\naction at once, so that the other boys could get the Pottawatomie killings behind\r\nthem, he explained.\r\n“They’ll need to stare some of these slavers in the face again and relearn what\r\nsort of beast we’re dealing with here.”\r\nIt turned out that, for the moment, at least, all was calm in Osawatomie: Ellen\r\nand Wealthy and Tonny had on their own fled our decrepit tents and half-built\r\ncabins at Browns Station for the town, evidently on the advice of friends who\r\nhad heard about the Pottawatomie killings. I spoke briefly there with Wealthy at\r\nthe door of the little house owned by the Days, distant relatives of hers from\r\nOhio. It was close to dawn, still dark, and I had come in stealthily on foot, with\r\nmy mount left hidden in a grove of trees by the west ford of the river, and had\r\nknocked quietly at the door, waking the dog, which someone inside quickly\r\nshushed.\r\nThen I heard Wealthy’s voice on the other side of the door: “No one’s here but\r\nwomen and children,” she announced.\r\n“It’s me, Owen. Are you all right?”\r\n“I can’t let you in. The Days are very afraid.”\r\n“I understand. Father just wants to know that you’re safe.” Opening the door a\r\ncrack, she showed me in a slat of candlelight her worried, pale face and said,\r\n“We’re safe, so long as we keep from you boys and Father Brown.”\r\nI asked her then if John and Jason were out with Uncle at his cabin, but she\r\nsaid that she could not tell me. I knew then that they were with Uncle. They\r\nwere safe, she said, but in hiding.",
    " The Ruffians burned Browns Station to the\r\nground this very night, she said, and stole all they could carry. Among the Free-\r\nState people, John’s and Jason’s innocence was well-known, she told me, but no\r\none was eager to risk protecting them. “Please stay away from them, Owen, until\r\nthis thing calms down,” she pleaded.\r\nI said that I understood her fears and that my report back to Father would\r\ncomfort him, and, bidding her good night, slipped out of town and reached my\r\nhorse without being seen. All that day, I hid in the tall grasses atop a rise out by\r\nthe road to Lawrence, with my horse grazing well out of sight in a nearby ravine,\r\nand watched riders in the distance heading back and forth between Osawatomie\r\nand Lawrence—hectic armed men of both sides gathering in bands to search for\r\nus: one side, the Free-Staters, to capture us and no doubt turn us over at once to\r\nthe federal authorities as a peace gesture; the others, pro-slave marauders, to\r\nshoot us on the spot. And I knew that there would soon be a third side: federal\r\ntroops from Forts Leavenworth and Scott, sent on orders from the President\r\nhimself to capture us and march us up to Lecompton for trial or else to turn a\r\nblind eye, as they had done so many times before, and hand us over to the\r\nRuffians and let them avenge themselves on us.\r\nWhen darkness had fallen, I rode down to the Lawrence Road and turned east\r\ntowards town and sometime after midnight pulled up before the Adair cabin. I\r\nwas frightened, certainly, but I was unattached and free, and all manner of men\r\nwere trying to kill me: I was like a hawk or a lone wolf or a cougar. No one had\r\na claim on me but Father, and though he did not know it, his claim had been\r\ngiven him by me, so that, in a crucial sense, the claim was reversed and was\r\nmine, not his at all.",
    "\r\nThe cabin, a two-room log structure that had been serving as Uncle’s\r\nparsonage until he could get a proper house finished in town next to his church,\r\nwas dark and appeared abandoned, for there was no smoke rising from the\r\nchimney. I knocked on the door, but no one answered, so I knocked again, but\r\nstill no one answered. There were no horses about and no dog. Maybe the Adairs\r\nhave fled, too, I thought, and knocked again, loudly, and called, “Uncle! It’s\r\nOwen here! I’m alone, Uncle!”\r\n“Get away!” my uncle shouted back from inside the cabin, startling me. “Get\r\naway as quick as you can!”\r\n“I just want to talk some with John and Jason.”\r\n“No! You endanger our lives! They won’t speak with you. You and your father\r\nhave made them into madmen.”\r\nI told him then to unbar the door and let me see for myself how mad they\r\nwere, but he said he would not and told me again to leave at once. “You are a\r\nvile murderer, Owen, a marked man!” he said.\r\n“Good,” said I. “Because I intend to be a marked man!” And stepping away\r\nfrom the door, I mounted my horse and headed off down the road again, west\r\nand then south to our camp on Middle Creek, where I knew Father and the\r\nothers were impatiently awaiting my return. Father, at least, would be impatient,\r\nfor I was sure that he would not commence raiding without me. The others I\r\ncould not be so sure of. For we had all been changed.\r\nJohn, as I later learned, went insensible and nearly mad and remained so for\r\nmany months, even while a prisoner of the United States Army, his condition\r\nhaving been exacerbated greatly by the terrible cruelties inflicted upon him by\r\nthe soldiers after they captured him, hiding nearly naked and babbling, in the\r\ngorse bushes several miles behind Uncle’s cabin, where, following my brief visit,\r\nhis delusions had chased him.",
    " Jason declined into a passive, self-accusing grief,\r\nwhich, though it later passed and he did indeed, finally, although only for a\r\nwhile, come over to our side in the war, drove him actually to seek out and\r\nsurrender himself to the United States troops. His release was quickly arranged,\r\nunlike John’s, which took until the following spring. I think Jason’s personal\r\nsafety and the safety of his wife, Ellen, were his main concerns and motives in all\r\nthat he did from then on, for as soon as he was able, he sent Ellen back to Ohio,\r\nalong with Wealthy and Tonny, and well before the end of the Kansas War\r\nfollowed them there himself.\r\nOliver and Salmon shortly came round to their normal senses, as did Henry\r\nThompson, but they, too, were different people than before: they were warriors\r\nnow, men who no longer questioned first principles or premises or Father, and\r\nconsequently they fought like young lions, as if every new war-like act were an\r\nerasure, a justification, of the Pottawatomie killings. Thus it was for them no\r\nlonger so much a matter of making Kansas a free state as it was of killing and\r\nterrorizing the pro-slavers, purely and simply. Strategy, long-range goals, overall\r\nplans—these were not their concern. For them, the war was merely a day-to-day\r\nkilling business, work organized and laid out by Father and me, as if we were\r\nlaying out farmwork in North Elba.\r\nAs for Fred, poor Fred: he was now even more wildly religious than before,\r\nand if Father was not an actual mystic and speaking privately with his God\r\n(which, as I said, he may well have been), Fred surely was. Happily, however,\r\nFred’s God merely confirmed what Father’s was saying and released him to\r\nfollow Father’s orders with murderous enthusiasm.\r\nFather was changed, too.",
    " It soon became clear, and surprised even me—\r\nperhaps especially me—that Pottawatomie had been a great gift to him: for it\r\nreturned him to his purest and in many ways most admirable self, the old,\r\nfervent, anti-slavery ideologist, and added to it a new self, one that up to now\r\nhad existed only in his imagination: the brilliant tactician and leader of men at\r\nwar. All his years of studying the science of war suddenly came into play and of\r\nnecessity were being put to good use out here on the rolling plains of\r\nsoutheastern Kansas. And with each new military success, from the\r\nPottawatomie killings on, with Black Jack and the Battle of Osawatomie and all\r\nthe lesser raids and ambushes and breathless escapes from our pursuers, his\r\nconfidence swelled and his enthusiasm for the work increased, so that before\r\nlong it was no longer required of me to goad or brace him in the least, and in\r\nfact I found myself barely able to keep pace with him. This was a most welcome\r\ndevelopment, for it restored to us our relationship of old. We were once again in\r\nproper balance. He was once again Abraham and I was Isaac.\r\nYet despite this, or perhaps because of it, I myself was not changed by the\r\nPottawatomie killings. No, I remained the same man who had migrated out to\r\nBrowns Station from Ohio with his self-mutilated brother, the man who had\r\nwatched in silence and did not stop his beloved friend from killing himself that\r\nday in Indian Pass, and who loved his friend’s wife in order not to love his\r\nfriend. I was still very much he who had carved the farm in North Elba out of\r\nthe wilderness while running escaped slaves north to Canada, the fellow who\r\nhad sailed off to England and in the crossing found his heart and spirit uplifted\r\nand enlarged by a woman bearing a sorrow and a wound he did not wish to\r\ncomprehend.",
    " I was still the man whose spirit one moment rose to the ceiling like\r\na hymn in a Negro church and the next insinuated its way towards a perverse\r\nbrawl in a nighttime park, the man who when still a boy humiliated himself and\r\ndemeaned a poor Irish girl of the streets in the back alleys of Springfield: all the\r\nway back to the boy, the very boy, who stole his grandfather’s watch and lied\r\nabout it and for his lies was made to chastize his father’s bare back with a\r\nswitch: I remained him, too.\r\nYet was it not due solely to this strict, stubborn persistence of my character\r\nthat, in point of fact, I, too, was now a different man than I had been before? For\r\nI now inhabited a world in which I was no longer seen as the outcast, the\r\ngrunting, inarticulate, crippled Owen Brown whom everyone easily loved but no\r\none feared: a man not half the man his father was. If instead I now found myself\r\ntwice the man my father was, as indeed betimes I did, it was not because I had\r\nchanged but because, after the Pottawatomie killings, whether they were with us\r\nthat night or not, my father and everyone else had changed.\r\nOver the following months our deeds drew to our side as many Free-State men\r\nas were repelled by them. Those who stayed on and endured our hardship and\r\ndeprivation and the almost daily risk to our lives were of necessity physically\r\nhardy fellows, but they were also the most courageous men out there then and\r\nthe most dedicated to the anti-slavery cause. Father would have said it was\r\nbecause they were dedicated to the anti-slavery cause. “It’s a mistake,”he told\r\nme, “to think that bullies make the best fighters, or that violent, cruel men\r\nwould be fitter to oppose the Southerners than our mild, abolitionist Christians.",
    "\r\nGive me men of good principles, God-fearing men, men who respect themselves\r\nand each other, and with a dozen of them I’ll oppose any hundred of such men\r\nas these Border Ruffians!” But this was a grinding, dangerous business after all,\r\nand those who undertook it had to be physically as well as mentally and\r\nspiritually tough: we were no regular army with a quartermaster and\r\nwagonloads of supplies, tents, and arms and plenty of fresh mounts following us\r\naround. We lived off the land, as they say, and alfresco, and were constantly on\r\nthe move, armed, supplied, fed, and clothed strictly by what equipment and\r\nlivestock we could liberate from our enemies.\r\nWe went barefoot in camp, to save boot leather, and when it rained stripped\r\noff our clothes and packed them to keep them dry. For weeks at a time, we\r\nsubsisted solely on skillet bread made from Indian meal and washed it down\r\nwith creek water mixed with a little ginger and molasses. By mid-summer the\r\nrivers were so low and the water so stagnant that we had to push aside the green\r\nscum on the surface before we dipped our cups to drink, and many of us were\r\nmuch of the time ill with the fever and ague.\r\nFather said, “I would rather have the small-pox, yellow fever, and cholera all\r\ntogether in my camp than a man without principles.” Throughout, he was cook,\r\nnurse, and teacher for his men, to set us a clear example, that we would in turn\r\nact as cook, nurse, and teacher for one another; and he instructed us constantly\r\nas to the purpose and eventual aims of our work, so that we would understand\r\nthat we were enduring these privations and risking our mortal lives to further a\r\ntruly noble cause. He never tired of exhorting us to treat as a heinous, soul-\r\ndamning sin any temptation to submit to laws and institutions condemned by\r\nour conscience and reason.",
    " “You must not obey a majority, no matter how large,\r\nif it oppose your principles and opinions.” He said this to each new volunteer\r\nand repeated it over and over to him, until it was engraved upon his mind. “The\r\nlargest majority,” he explained, “is often only an organized mob whose noise can\r\nno more change the false into the true than it can change black into white or\r\nnight into day. And a minority, conscious of its rights, if those rights are based\r\non moral principles, will sooner or later become a just majority. What we’re\r\nbuilding here is nothing less than the free commonwealth promised us by our\r\nDeclaration of Independence and prophesied and ordained by God in the Bible.”\r\nHe enjoyed making our camp into a philosophical and political classroom, and\r\nsuch were the power of his ideas and the force of his expressiveness that even\r\nthough many of his men were either illiterate and unused to abstract disputation\r\nor else were agnostical, they were nonetheless, for the most part, eager students.\r\nHe instructed the men as to the faults of both parties in Kansas, showing, of the\r\npro-slavery side, how slavery besotted the enslavers of men and coarsened them\r\nand made them into brutal beasts. Of the Free-State side, he said that, while\r\nthere were many who were noble, true men, unfortunately they were being led\r\nby broken-down, cynical politicians of the old order, timid men who would\r\nrather pass high-sounding resolutions than act against slavery with a force of\r\narms. He insisted that a politician could never be trusted anyhow, for even if he\r\nheld a decent conviction, he was ever ready to sacrifice it to advantage himself.",
    "\r\nFather argued that society as a whole must come to be organized on a different\r\nbasis than greed, for while material interests gained somewhat by the\r\ninstitutionalized deification of pure selfishness, ordinary men and women lost\r\neverything by it. Despite his earlier attempts to acquire wealth, he believed that\r\nall great reforms in the past, such as the Christian religion, as well as the reform\r\nwhich we ourselves were now embarked upon, were based on broad, generous\r\nprinciples, and therefore he condemned the sale of land as a chattel, for instance,\r\nand thought that it should be held in common and in trust, as had been\r\npracticed by the Indians when the Europeans first arrived here. Slavery,\r\nhowever, was “the sum of all villainies,” and its abolition was therefore the first\r\nessential work of all modern reformers. He was perfectly convinced that if the\r\nAmerican people did not end it speedily, human freedom and republican liberty\r\nwould pass forever from this nation and possibly from all mankind.\r\nFather, as always, slept little, as did I myself now, and often it turned out that\r\nonly he and I would be awake keeping late watch, he having early dismissed the\r\ngrateful regularly scheduled watch, and as he was, like many surveyors, a\r\nthorough astronomer, he enjoyed pointing out the different constellations and\r\ntheir clock-like movements across the deep, velvety sky. “Now,” he would say,\r\n“it is exactly one hour past midnight,” and he would show me which stars to\r\nseparate from the myriad of lighted pinpoints overhead and how to line them up\r\nso that they resembled the hands on Grandfather’s old clock. He often turned\r\nrhapsodical at these times. “How admirable is the symmetry of the heavens!\r\nHow grand and beautiful it is! Look how in the government of God everything\r\nmoves in sublime harmony!” he declared.",
    " “Nothing like that down here with the\r\ngovernment of man, eh?”\r\nFather was pretty easily brought to heightened emotion in those days, even to\r\nthe point of shedding tears and sometimes to loud laughter as well, which was\r\nuncharacteristic and probably due in part to the generally high level of tension\r\nand excitement that we habitually and necessarily lived with out there on the\r\nplains all that year and into the next. It made him seem physically larger than he\r\nwas and gave his personality added volume, too, and because of his acts of\r\nviolence against the enemy and his growing reputation as a warrior and\r\nsuccessful leader of men, notwithstanding the fact that he always went about\r\nwell-armed, with twin revolvers and his broadsword at his belt, a Sharps rifle\r\nclose at hand, and a dirk in a scabbard above his boot, he was never, as\r\nsometimes of old, an object of derision: his manias were widely regarded now as\r\npassions, his stubbornness as belief in principles, his willfulness as self-\r\nassurance, and his Bible-based strategies as brilliant innovations in the science of\r\nwarfare.\r\nEven the enemy regarded him that way. They were not wrong to do so, of\r\ncourse, but it helped that, compared to us, our Free-State allies were timid and\r\nthat our enemies were disorganized, ill-trained, often drunk, and inadequately\r\narmed. And as the Border Ruffians were mostly natives of Missouri rivertowns\r\nand did not live or work in Kansas, they did not know the countryside as well as\r\nwe. The federal troops, though well led and equipped, were young, frightened\r\nconscripts and few in numbers, too few by far to patrol that vast a region\r\neffectively. And it was helpful, too, that Father, for the first time in his life, was\r\nlucky.\r\nThe famous Battle of Black Jack is an example.",
    " It has been written about often\r\nand described as a turning point in the war against slavery, but certain defining\r\nelements of the story always get left out. A bright, sunny Sunday morning in\r\nearly June it was, and we had all gathered in a field out on the Santa Fe Trail\r\nnear the tiny, mostly burned-out, Free-State settlement named Prairie City.\r\nFather had led us there to confer with a Captain Samuel Shore as to the\r\npossibility of combining our force with Captain Shore’s so-called Prairie City\r\nRifles, one of the few Free-State militias aggressive enough to merit Father’s\r\napproval. We were also there to attend an outdoor service led by a popular\r\nitinerant preacher by the name of John Moore, two of whose sons had recently\r\nbeen captured and hauled off by a large band of marauding Border Ruffians led\r\nby the Virginian Henry Clay Pate. Pate would in time become a well-known\r\ncolonel of the Fifth Virginia Cavalry in the Civil War, but in Kansas, though at\r\nbottom a pro-slavery Ruffian, he was a deputy United States marshal and had\r\nassisted the federal forces in the recent capture near Paola of brother John and\r\nhad helped take in Jason also and had been pushing on into Kansas with his\r\npack of Ruffians in search of us remaining Browns.\r\nWe had close to a dozen men in our group at that time, not including the\r\njournalist Redpath, who afterwards wrote up the story for the Eastern\r\nnewspapers. Having arrived late, we stood on horseback at the edge of the\r\ncrowd close by the road, which was more a rutted wagon track there than a\r\nproper road, when Fred drew first my and then Father’s attention to three riders\r\napproaching from the east, the direction of Black Jack Spring. As we had\r\nintelligence that Pate’s band of Ruffians had recently been seen encamped out\r\nthere at Black Jack, and as the riders were strangers to all, Father decided to\r\ngrab them.",
    " “Owen, take five of the men and run those fellows down,” he said,\r\nand returned his attention to Preacher Moore’s ongoing peroration.\r\nWith Fred, I gathered together Oliver and three others (I think including\r\nAugust Bondi, who after Harpers Ferry was said, first by the Southern press and\r\nthen by the Northern press as well, to have been a Jew, but who, as far as I\r\nknew, was merely agnostical and of Austrian parentage) and rode out to meet\r\nthe strangers. As soon as they saw us coming, they broke and ran like rabbits\r\nacross the plain in three different directions. Like rabbit hunters, we split into\r\ntwo parties of three, enabling us quickly to cut off and capture two of the men,\r\nwhom we marched at gunpoint back to the service, which had by then ended,\r\nthus freeing Father to interrogate the terrified fellows.\r\n“I am Captain John Brown,” he announced to them, and needed little more to\r\nobtain their swift confession that they were from the camp at Black Jack. But not\r\nof the party of Henry Clay Pate, they insisted, which no one believed, so we\r\nbound them and turned them over to Captain Shore, who had one of his Prairie\r\nCity volunteers march the two back to town, there to await negotiations with the\r\nRuffians for an eventual exchange of prisoners—a useful, widespread practice\r\namong the warring parties that, for a while, until the Ruffians started executing\r\ntheir prisoners, helped keep the bloodshed down on both sides.\r\nImmediately, most of the congregation called for a raid on Pate’s camp, their\r\nardor being somewhat heated, perhaps, by the reported presence in the camp of\r\nthe two sons of Mr. Moore, a man whom they now loved, and by Pate’s having\r\naided in the capture of John and Jason, which was widely seen by Free-State\r\npeople as unwarranted.",
    " Father, however, advised the excited crowd to wait till\r\nnightfall, so they could arrive in Black Jack at dawn, when least expected. This\r\nwas wise, because the delay allowed those who had been merely carried along\r\nby the enthusiasm of the moment to separate themselves from men who, like the\r\nGileadites, could be relied upon in a fight, which ended up being all of our group\r\nand most of Captain Shore’s militia.\r\nAround four o’clock the next morning, we arrived at the copse of black oak\r\ntrees for which the spring had been named. We were situated on a long slope a\r\nhalf-mile north of the Ruffian encampment and could see in the gray dawn haze\r\ntheir line of covered wagons below, with the tents pitched behind them and, on\r\nthe wooded slope to the rear, their picketed horses and mules. As there were no\r\nfires and no other activity evident in the camp, we assumed they were still\r\nsleeping, so we dismounted and, leaving Fred in charge of the horses, made our\r\nway stealthily downhill through the brush, where we split into two groups,\r\nFather’s nine men and Captain Shore’s fifteen. At this point, about sixty rods\r\nfrom the wagons, we were discovered by a sentinel who had been posted up by\r\nthe picketed animals, and he fired his musket and shouted the alarm: “We’re\r\nunder attack!”\r\nLike bees swarming from a hive, the half-dressed Ruffians ran from their tents\r\nand commenced firing on us. Instantly, Captain Shore and his men, who were in\r\na somewhat more exposed position than we, laid down a barrage of return fire,\r\nwhile Father led us on the run off to the right a ways, ordering us as he ran not\r\nto fire yet. “Hold your fire, boys, and remember, when you do shoot, aim low!”\r\nThat was always his advice: get to close quarters and aim low. And aim for the\r\nbody, not the head. “Every one of us would be dead by now” he often said, “if\r\nour enemies had aimed low.",
    "”\r\nAfter a few moments, we had made our way to a protected position in a ravine\r\nto the right of the wagons. From there, we could get clear, covered shots on the\r\nRuffians, so we laid down our own barrage, which drove them to the backside of\r\ntheir camp into a further ravine, where they kept up a steady fusillade against\r\nboth Captain Shore’s men in front of them and us on the flank.\r\nAs Captain Shore’s men had commenced firing earlier than we and more\r\nrecklessly, they were soon out of ammunition and could no longer return fire,\r\nand because they were the more exposed, they started taking on injuries, and\r\nseveral of his men cried out, “I’m hit! I’m hit! Someone help me, I’m a dead\r\nman!” One fellow over there was sobbing like a sorrowful woman. I saw three of\r\nShore’s men—one of them the preacher Moore—break and run back up the long\r\nslope towards the grove of black oaks. Then three more fled.\r\nWe were trapped, with no alternative to seeing it through to victory or death;\r\nand the men knew that now. Father prowled back and forth behind us, scolding\r\nus and bucking us up and pointing out targets as they appeared, making of\r\nhimself a most obvious target in the process, but seeming not to care, as if daring\r\nthe enemy to shoot him. Several times I shouted, “Father, stay down!” but he\r\nonly scowled at me, as if I were being cowardly. There was shooting coming\r\nfrom all directions and from both sides: terrified men were firing their weapons\r\nrandomly at targets made invisible and everywhere by simple human fear: our\r\nboys were firing as much at Shore’s men as at Pate’s, and both those bands were\r\nshooting in our direction also, and we all may even have fired sometimes at\r\nourselves, so that when Henry Thompson took a bullet in the thigh and rolled\r\naway from me, slapping at his wound and hollering, “Damn! Damn! Damn!",
    "” as if\r\nhe’d been stung by a red-hot coal, I didn’t know if he’d been hit by a Ruffian’s\r\nbullet or a Free-State militiaman’s. I couldn’t even be positive that I hadn’t\r\naccidentally shot him myself. Father rushed to Henry’s side and ripped a strip of\r\ncloth from his own shirttail, took out his dirk, and with it and the strip of cloth\r\nmade a tourniquet for him.\r\nSomewhere in here I remember Captain Shore appearing in our ravine with a\r\nsmall number of his men, those who had not cut and run: he was telling Father\r\nthat they were out of ammunition and would have to retreat or else go for\r\nreinforcements. He had one man dead, five who were wounded, and six who had\r\ndeserted. The Ruffians had dug in good, he said, and could wait us out, unless\r\nwe got more men and ammunition quickly. He seemed much discouraged. Father\r\nwas disgusted and told him to go on back for reinforcements, then, and take the\r\ndead man and the wounded with him, including Henry Thompson.\r\nThen, when Shore and his men had left, Father told us to open fire on the\r\nRuffians’ horses and mules, which were picketed in a rope corral a short ways\r\nuphill from the tents. “It’ll distract them so Captain Shore can get his men out,\r\nand maybe it’ll even draw a few of them out of their hole to where we can pick\r\nthem off,” he said. He told us this time not to aim low but to shoot at the\r\nanimals’ heads, because he wanted them to die, not to suffer, and they were\r\neasier to hit than men anyhow.\r\nWe obeyed and shot into the wild-eyed herd of animals. The horses and mules\r\nneighed and brayed loudly when they were hit, and they tripped and trampled\r\nupon one another in the dust, as first one poor beast went down and then a\r\nsecond and a third. It was an awful sight, and I had trouble going along with it,\r\nbut I said nothing and fired away with the others.",
    " I shot horses and mules and\r\nmen that day and had very few thoughts of what I was doing or why, but at one\r\npoint, in the midst of this carnage, I suddenly saw us all, almost as if I were not\r\na part of it: bands of terrified white American boys and men killing each other\r\nand screaming bloody murder into one another’s faces and shooting down poor,\r\ndumb animals, slaying one another and our livestock and terrorizing our\r\nmothers and wives and children and burning our houses and crops—all to settle\r\nthe fate of Negro Americans living hundreds and even thousands of miles away\r\nfrom here, a people who were much unlike us and who were utterly unaware of\r\nwhat we were inflicting upon each other here on this hot June morning in\r\namongst the black oak trees of Kansas. It was no longer clear to me: were we\r\ndoing this for them, the Negroes; or were we simply using them as an excuse to\r\ncommit vile crimes against one another? Was our true nature that of the man\r\nwho sacrifices himself and others for his principles; or was it that of the\r\ncriminal? You could not tell it from our acts.\r\nFiring on the horses and mules evidently surprised and distracted the enemy\r\nsufficiently to cover Captain Shore’s retreat from the battle– field, but it drew\r\nnone of the Ruffians from their cover, and as soon as all the animals were down,\r\nthey started in again on us. From their ravine behind the tents, they kept us\r\nhuddled under a blanket of rifle-fire, and as we could get no good angle on\r\nthem, we were obliged to lie low and prepare for their final charge, which we\r\nfigured was coming next. Father instructed us to have our broadswords and\r\nrevolvers at the ready. “Wait till they close on us, boys, and pick your targets\r\ncarefully. If their leaders go down at the start, the rest might flee, even though\r\nthey hugely outnumber us.”\r\nBut then an astonishing thing happened.",
    " I was lying with my back to the\r\nravine, facing uphill towards the grove by the spring, so I saw it all: Fred, alone\r\non horseback, appeared at the edge of the trees and was surveying the scene\r\nbelow with mild surmise, when suddenly he raised his broadsword over his head\r\nand came galloping full speed down the long slope straight towards us and the\r\nenemy beyond, shouting loudly as he neared us, “We have them surrounded! We\r\nhave them surrounded!” All firing ceased, as Fred rode across the cleared space\r\nthat divided us from the Ruffians, still waving his cutlass and bellowing, “We\r\nhave them surrounded!” Then he disappeared into the bushes off to our left, and\r\nwe saw him no more.\r\nWe were silent for a moment and looked at one another in puzzlement.\r\n“That was Fred,” Salmon said. “Why do you suppose he did that?” Father\r\nanswered that he didn’t know, but look, and sure enough, there came Captain\r\nPate and one of his lieutenants, walking towards us and waving a white flag.\r\nWhat followed is well known: Pate wished to obtain a truce, he said. He declared\r\nthat he was a deputy United States marshal sent out by the government to\r\ncapture “certain persons for whom writs of arrest have been issued—”\r\nFather cut him off and in his coldest voice said, “I’ve been told that before, sir.\r\nI know who you are and why you are here. You will surrender unconditionally,\r\nCaptain Pate, or we will leave every one of you lying dead with your animals\r\nover there.”\r\n“Give me fifteen minutes—” Pate said, but Father again interrupted and drew\r\nhis revolver on him and commanded him to have his men lay down their arms.\r\nWe put our weapons out where they could be seen and aimed them straight at\r\nPate and his lieutenant.\r\nFather said, “You’re surrounded, you realize.”\r\n“But we’re here under a white flag,” Pate said. “You can’t throw down on us\r\nwith a white flag showing.",
    " That violates the articles of war.”\r\n“Who drew up those articles?” Father asked. “Not I. Not thee, Captain Pate.\r\nNo, you are my prisoner. And if you don’t tell your men to lay down their arms,\r\nI’ll shoot you dead.”\r\nYou could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes: Father was ready to kill\r\nthe man and let himself be shot for it at once, as would surely happen, for he\r\nand Pate and Pate’s man stood alone up on the lip of the ravine, fully exposed to\r\nthe guns of the enemy. Luckily, Pate was no fool: he could read Father’s intent\r\nand was himself not eager to die. He agreed to surrender and sent his lieutenant\r\ntrotting back to his lines to instruct his men to lay down their arms and march\r\nout with their hands on their heads. Which, a few moments later, they did,\r\nsurprising us, when they were all lined up before us, with their numbers, for\r\nthere were twenty-six of them, uninjured and well-armed. Pate’s men were, of\r\ncourse, even more surprised when they saw how few we were, and they were\r\nangry at their captain, who lost much face by the surrender and later\r\ncomplained bitterly of what he called Father’s “deceptive, casual disregard for\r\nthe rules of war.”\r\nThus ended the famous Battle of Black Jack, which Father, in a letter to the\r\nNew York Tribune, rightly named “the first regular battle fought between Free-\r\nState and Pro-Slavery forces in Kansas.” We had killed four men and wounded\r\nnearly a dozen and captured more prisoners in one sweep than had so far been\r\ncaptured by all the Free–State forces in total. In the North and amongst the Free-\r\nStaters, John Brown came away with nearly heroic stature; to the Southerners,\r\nhe was now the devil incarnate.\r\nHad it not been for Fred’s miraculous intervention, however, his mad,\r\ndelusional charge onto the battlefield, the Battle of Black Jack would have ended\r\nmuch differently.",
    " His son’s apparent madness was Father’s good fortune: for Fred\r\ndid, in fact, believe that we had the Ruffians surrounded, and he insisted for\r\ndays afterwards that he had seen Free-State men on all sides firing on the\r\nRuffians from the bushes and slaughtering them without mercy. He had acted,\r\nhe said, to end the terrible slaughter of the Missourians.\r\nWe knew, of course, that he had only seen the horses and mules going down,\r\nthat it was the slaughter of the animals that had maddened him, and I said as\r\nmuch to Father.\r\n“The boy was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision,” he answered. “That is\r\nall that matters.”\r\nI see that, almost inadvertently, I have been writing you much that concerns my\r\nbrother Fred, and perhaps I should complete his story here. Towards the end of\r\nAugust, I walked out one morning from camp alone very early to observe the sun\r\nrise, an event I had not seen in several weeks, for we had been night-raiding for\r\na long while at a hectic pace over in Linn County and during the daylight hours\r\nhad mostly hidden out in the marshes and deep gullies, sleeping whenever we\r\ncould, and thus we had had little opportunity or time for admiring God’s orderly\r\ngovernance of the universe, as it were. Recently, however, we had succeeded in\r\ndriving a herd of nearly one hundred fifty head of liberated Ruffian cattle into\r\nOsawatomie for distribution amongst the people there and, feeling protected by\r\ntheir gratitude, had encamped a few miles from town and, for the first night in a\r\nfortnight, been given a normal parcel of sleep. Thus we felt able to lighten our\r\nvigilance somewhat, causing Father to release me from my usual task of\r\noverseeing the watch, and I had been allowed to enjoy a full night wrapped in\r\nmy blanket by the guttering fire.",
    "\r\nWhen I first rolled out of my blanket that morning, Father was nowhere in\r\nsight—commiserating or consulting with his God in the bushes someplace\r\nnearby, I supposed. I was surprised, therefore, when, as I emerged from the tree\r\ncover and approached the grassy ridge above our campsite, I spotted him\r\nprofiled against the sky there, gazing eastward towards the horizon, as if he, too,\r\nhad come out to see the sun rise. It was a cool, dry morning, not quite dawn,\r\nwith no breeze. The sky was enormous and loomed above us like a tautly drawn\r\ncelestial tent, and the land swept darkly away beneath it like a vast, chilled\r\ndesert. Back in camp in the gully, it was still dark as night, although up here the\r\nsoutheastern sky had faded to a soft, crumbly gray, making Father’s figure a\r\nsharp, paper-thin silhouette against it. I silently took my place beside him on the\r\nridge, and together we stared out across the rolling prairie in the direction of the\r\nsettlement of Osawatomie, some five miles distant, down along the Marais des\r\nCygnes.\r\nA moment or two passed, when, out on the horizon, there appeared parallel to\r\nit a long string of silver light. Soon it had thickened into a metallic strap and\r\nbroadened, and after a few moments, the lower edge of the silver strap took on a\r\ngolden hue, while above the strap the fleecy clouds began to go from gray to\r\nyellow to red, as if a fire were being lit below them. It was strikingly beautiful\r\nand strange in its clarity and exactness. I said to Father, “It looks like it’s a\r\nminiature scene and close to us. Like a painting, almost, instead of huge and far\r\naway and real.”\r\nThe Old Man merely nodded and said nothing. Perhaps he was used to such\r\nvisions. I lapsed back into silence and continued watching the eastern horizon\r\nslowly shift color and shape.",
    " Soon, when I knew that the scarlet disk of the sun\r\nwas about to break the horizon and shatter the scene with its rays, I saw an\r\nextraordinary thing. It’s something that occurs rarely, but nonetheless normally,\r\nat sea or on the desert, and also, on the rarest of occasions, happens out on the\r\nprairies of the West, where it appears in more nearly perfect detail and on a\r\nmuch grander scale. Commonly called a mirage, it’s disdained for that, despite\r\nits beauty and rarity, as if it were merely an illusion. But it is in no way an\r\nillusion. It is real and is taking place in present time. What one sees is not a\r\nhallucinated or imagined scene: when, as on this morning, the atmospheric and\r\ngeographic conditions are perfectly aligned, objects and entire scenes and events\r\nlocated far beyond one’s normal range of vision are brought close and are made\r\nsharply, silently visible; or else the beholder himself is instantly transported from\r\nhis former spot across the many miles of prairie, carried as if on a Mohammedan\r\nflying carpet and brought face-to-face with a scene that he could otherwise have\r\nonly imagined or dreamed.\r\nIt is actually unclear which is moved, the scene in the distance or the observer\r\nhere at hand. Perhaps it’s that the visible aspect of a thing, of any thing, is like\r\nits smell, and when atmospheric conditions are right, its visible aspect can be\r\ncarried away separately, like a spoor, to an observer who is situated many miles\r\ndistant and who then is enabled to see the thing up close, the way one can\r\nsometimes wake to the smell of coffee being brewed over a fire far down the\r\nvalley from one’s bed and think it’s being made in the next room.\r\nThis is what Father and I saw: at first, there was a misty, grayish scrim that\r\nrose from the horizon and became a semi-opaque sheet.",
    " Then, evolving out of a\r\nseries of dark, vertical threads and strings, solid objects began to appear against\r\nit, and in a few seconds, a familiar bit of scenery had taken shape—the road that\r\nled past Uncle Sam Adair’s cabin, on the near side of Osawatomie. There were\r\nthe trees and the creek and the burnt-over stumps of his field and even the\r\nsmoke curling from his chimney. In the further distance, I saw a man walking\r\nfrom the spring with a bucket in each hand.\r\nThe man was Fred! My brother Fred, barefoot and shirtless, was walking\r\nslowly towards the cabin, looking lost in thought or prayer. I was too astonished\r\nand pleased by the sight to speak of it. Three days before, Father had ordered\r\nhim to Lawrence for supplies and mail from home and to ask for reinforcements\r\nfor the defense of the town of Osawatomie, but Fred had felt indisposed from a\r\nrecent onslaught of the ague and had begged to stay at Uncle’s for a while, until\r\nhe recovered, and Father had relented. I had not expected to see him again for a\r\nweek or more, and now here he was, soundless as death, but very much alive\r\nand before my eyes making his slow way along the roadway from the spring to\r\nthe cabin, as if he were alone and invisible to all eyes but his own.\r\nAt that instant, there came three riders over the crest of the hill a ways behind\r\nFred, men whom I recognized at once as Ruffians, men who had been riding\r\nwith John Reid, the Mexican War veteran from Missouri who had given himself\r\nthe rank of general and headed up one of those bands that had been in particular\r\nhot pursuit of us Browns since Pottawatomie and Black Jack months earlier.",
    " Reid\r\nhad threatened noisily on many occasions to burn down the entire town of\r\nOsawatomie, but this was late August, and we had begun not to take these\r\nblowhard threats too seriously, for we had most of these men well on the run all\r\nacross the territory by now, and despite their numbers, all they were capable of\r\nwere random raids on isolated cabins and farms. It was from some of Reid’s\r\npeople, in fact, that we had stolen the herd of cattle recently left off with the\r\ncitizens of Osawatomie—stolen back, I should say—and the three I now saw\r\nriding up on Fred I had marked then as villains, and Father and I had even\r\nbriefly spoken with them: coarse, brutal men whose main object was looting and\r\npillaging the farms and lands of Free-State settlers.\r\n“Fred!” I cried. “Look behind you!”\r\n“He can’t hear you, Owen,” Father said in a low voice. “He may be done for.”\r\nHelplessly, as if bound to a stake, we watched from our spot miles from the\r\nscene, while the three riders approached Fred from behind. They had come over\r\nthe rise from the direction of town, sent out, as I quickly surmised, to\r\nreconnoiter for General Reid, in preparation for his oft-threatened raid on the\r\nsettlement. Their presence probably meant that Reid and his hundred-man force\r\nof Ruffians were close by. But Fred did not seem to recognize the men at all or to\r\nregard them as enemies. He turned and stopped in the road, and as they neared,\r\nhe stood and watched, apparently unafraid, as if the men were merely local Free-\r\nStaters not known to him.\r\nFather and I were close enough to the scene to see over his shoulder, as it\r\nwere, and we stared in silence as Fred nodded good morning and the others\r\ntouched the brims of their hats and made to pass, when one of the men, the\r\nlarge-bellied fellow in the center, gave Fred a hard stare.",
    " I would later learn that\r\nthis was the Reverend Martin White, a notorious and malignant pro-slaver from\r\nArkansas who back in ’54 had come out to settle and preach to his fellow pro-\r\nslavers, one of those men who, after the Pottawatomie affair, had become fixated\r\non avenging himself against us Browns.\r\nAlthough I could not hear him, I saw him speak to Fred and found that I could\r\nread his lips somewhat: I know you! he seems to say. And Fred, who still has not\r\nrecognized the danger, advances open-faced towards the men to greet them, his\r\nbuckets still in his hands, his bare chest exposed to the riders, who draw out\r\ntheir revolvers and throw down on him. Fred stops in his tracks now and looks\r\nwonderingly, innocently, up at them, as once more the man in the middle,\r\nReverend White, silently mouths some words: You’re one of John Browns boys!\r\nBy now, Fred’s face has gone all dark and serious, for he has finally seen the\r\ndangerous fix he is in, and he shakes his head no, he’s not one of John Brown’s\r\nboys.\r\nI know you! White declares.\r\nFred again shakes his head no. He mouths the words I don’t know John Brown.\r\nWhere’s he hiding?\r\nI don’t know him.\r\nYes, you are his son! says White, and he levels his revolver and fires straight\r\ninto Fred’s pale, bare chest.\r\nThe bullet killed him at once, and he fell like a stone in the middle of the road.\r\nFor a few seconds, the riders stared down at his crumpled, lifeless body and the\r\nspilled water buckets. Then they spurred their horses into a gallop and rode off,\r\nheading away from town in the direction they had come, no doubt to bring\r\nReid’s force straight on.\r\nDark blood poured from the hole in Fred’s chest and puddled over and around\r\nhis body. A light breeze lifted and flattened the leaves of the nearby cottonwood\r\ntrees and sifted the tall grasses alongside the road.",
    " And now, slowly, the scene\r\nbegan to fade from view, gathering itself back into the dark threads and strings\r\nfrom which it had emerged, until once again Father and I were gazing across the\r\nfeatureless prairie towards the eastern horizon, staring at nothing, and the sun\r\nwas risen, blasting back at us, radiant and bright yellow and orange, driving the\r\nfleecy, gold-tinged clouds from the skies and bathing our faces in its light.\r\n“Murderers!” I cried. Enraged and horrified was I—but I spoke also as if to\r\nverify the actuality of what I had just seen, for I could scarcely believe that it\r\nhad truly happened.\r\n“He denied me,” Father said in a low voice.\r\n“They shot him like a dog!”\r\n“If he had not denied me, they wouldn’t have shot him. They would have\r\ntaken him prisoner is all, as they did John and Jason. I’m sure of it.”\r\n“No. Even if you’re right, it’s not true,” I declared. Fred was gone, and gone\r\nfrom us forever—my wholly innocent brother, my childhood companion, the boy\r\nand man I had loved and envied more than all the others, the one I would have\r\nbeen myself, if I had been strong enough, clear enough, humble enough, if I had\r\nbeen a Christian: my best brother was dead.\r\nFather turned to me and said, “What do you mean, it’s not true?” “Fred has\r\nbeen killed! And that’s the simple fact of it! That’s the truth of the matter. Why\r\nhe was killed, or how he might have avoided it—those aren’t important now,\r\nFather. He’s dead. He’s your son, my brother, and he’s dead!”\r\nI looked into Father’s ice-gray eyes and saw a strange sort of puzzlement there,\r\nand for the first time realized that he could neither comprehend nor share my\r\nfeelings at that moment, and thus he did not in the slightest understand me. He\r\ndid not know who I was. Or who Fred had been.",
    " And consequently, in a crucial\r\nway, though he had seen it with his own eyes, he did not know what had just\r\nhappened.\r\nSuddenly, I felt pity for the Old Man. Despite his intelligence and his gifts of\r\nlanguage and his mastery of stratagem, he possessed a rare and dangerous kind\r\nof stupidity—a stupidity of the heart. It was possibly the very thing that,\r\ncombined with his intelligence, gifts, and mastery, had indeed made him into an\r\nirresistible leader of men, had made him a resourceful and courageous warrior\r\nand even a powerful, rigorous man of religion; but his stupid heart had also\r\nmade him dangerous, fatally dangerous, to anyone who loved him and to anyone\r\nwhom he loved back. More than the rest of us, Fred had loved the Old Man; and\r\nFather had loved him more than all his other children back. And now Fred was a\r\ndead man.\r\n“He has made the blood remission. He is with the Lord,” Father said, and he\r\nturned to go. “Come on, we have to rouse the boys. Reid’s prepared to raid\r\nOsawatomie, and we have to warn the people and help defend them.” He paused\r\nfor a second and said, “I believe that the Lord has given us this vision for their\r\nsake, not Fred’s.”\r\nThen he left me. I lingered a moment longer, watching the sun blot out the\r\neastern horizon with its light, and saw Fred’s open face float against the light,\r\nand his slow, thoughtful gestures and ways, and heard faintly in the breeze his\r\ngentle, abrupt voice—an illusion this time, no mirage, no vision given by the\r\nLord, and it was already beginning to fade. Then slowly, reluctantly, so as to\r\ndepart from it before it disappeared altogether, I turned away from this weak,\r\ndiminishing apparition of my dead brother and followed Father’s cold, dark form\r\ndown the ridge into the camp.\r\nOn that day, the day that his son was killed, Father fought the battle that made\r\nhim known as Osawatomie Brown.",
    " Until his own death and for many years after,\r\neven to today, it was his public name. Perhaps—despite my account and because\r\nof yours—it will be his name forever. Other men, most of whom had never seen\r\nhim in the flesh—the journalists and hagiographers of the North, mainly—gave\r\nit to him, but he quickly embraced it himself and took to signing, with a vain\r\nflourish, his letters and the autograph books of his admirers with it: Osawatomie\r\nBrown. Or sometimes, more formally, John Brown of Osawatomie. On the day that\r\nhe sacrificed his best son upon the stone altar of his belief, Father within hours\r\nwas transformed from a mortal man—an extraordinary and famous man, to be\r\nsure, but, still, only a man—into a hero bathed in swirls of light. It mattered not\r\nwhether they liked his ways or admired his courage or believed his words; the\r\nAmerican people from then on viewed him as more and other than a man.\r\nThis transformation, before anyone else even knew that it had occurred, Father\r\nalready understood and had begun using for his own secret purposes. In the\r\nmind of the South, he would be Baal and Anathema. And in the imagination of\r\nthe North, he would make him-self a Greek or Roman hero, Achilles in his tent\r\nor Horatio at the bridge, or one of the old, impetuous, dragon-slaying heroes of\r\nArthurian romance, each of whom in the beginning surely had been, like him, a\r\nflesh-and-blood man who, one day, when a sufficient number of stories about\r\nhim had accumulated in the public mind, stepped across an invisible line and, as\r\nif by magic, became other than human: the son lay murdered in the dusty Kansas\r\ntrack, and the father would ride down that track into legend.",
    " So that, in the\r\nNorth, Osawatomie Brown soon reached the point of fame where he could lose a\r\nbattle, and it would nonetheless be regarded as a victory—a triumph, if not for\r\nhim or for the anti-slavery forces, then for the human spirit. In the South, his\r\nvictories signaled the coming millennium, the impending war between the races,\r\nand his losses entered the accounts as proof, not of his military feebleness or\r\npersonal failure, but of his enemies’ courage and virtue in defense of slavery. All\r\nmen now measured their stature and meaning against Osawatomie Brown’s.\r\nIn mundane reality, however, the Battle of Osawatomie was neither loss nor\r\nvictory: I was there. It had no political or military stature and no philosophical\r\nor religious meaning. I broke and ran with the others, abandoning the town to\r\nthe Ruffians’ scourging fire and pillage; I know what it was—merely a failed\r\ndefense on our part, and a looting raid on theirs.\r\nNeither Father nor I, without having agreed between ourselves, said anything\r\nto the others in our party of what we had witnessed from the ridge at dawn that\r\nmorning, except that we had spotted General Reid’s scouts returning from\r\nOsawatomie, riding away from the settlement east to west, towards the\r\nLawrence Road, where, according to rumor, Reid’s force had temporarily\r\nbivouacked. And when we rode down from our camp into town, passing Uncle’s\r\ncabin, where Fred’s body lay inside on a plank table, we did not stop to pray\r\nover it or to speak solemnly with its sad, frightened attendants of Fred’s brief life\r\nand useless death; we rode straight on to warn the settlers of the imminent raid\r\nfrom General Reid’s band of irregulars, which we knew numbered in the\r\nhundreds.\r\nReid had been moving across the countryside for weeks, gathering all the loose\r\ngangs of marauders into a cohesive force.",
    " Rumors, until then mostly discounted\r\nby us, had been flying from one Free-State redoubt to another: that he wished to\r\nmake a final, defining attack on Lawrence and then on Topeka, the capitals of\r\nKansas abolitionism-attacks that we knew would not be tolerated by the federal\r\narmy, in spite of the unspoken, continued support of the pro-slavers’ interests by\r\nthe President and his Secretary of War; not wishing to get caught between the\r\nRuffians and the federal troops, we had left the defense of both cities to their\r\nown citizens. And until we saw Reid’s scouts returning that morning from\r\nOsawatomie, we had not thought that he would bother taking Osawatomie, in\r\nspite of its reputation as an abolitionist stronghold and, notwithstanding our\r\nlong absence from the place, its reputation as the Kansas base of the Browns. By\r\nthis time, Wealthy and little Tonny and Ellen had returned to Ohio; John and\r\nJason were in Topeka; and our brother-in-law Henry, after suffering his leg\r\nwound at Black Jack, had gone home to sister Ruth and their little farm in North\r\nElba. Most of the other inhabitants had fled the town by now as well, so that it\r\nwas a cluster of barely twenty families—poor, stubborn folks who had refused to\r\nabandon their cabins and property to the pro-slave predators of the region but\r\nwho, unlike the more organized and well-armed citizens of Lawrence and\r\nTopeka, posed no real threat to the Ruffians.",
    "\r\nHowever, due to our having distributed amongst them the one hundred fifty\r\nhead of cattle that we on nighttime raids had been liberating piecemeal from\r\nsmall bands of Ruffians over the previous weeks, we had unintentionally made\r\nthe town an object of General Reid’s especial attention, and it now appeared that\r\nhe had stopped on his march towards Lawrence and was coming in unexpectedly\r\nfrom the west, moving south of the Marais des Cygnes River and north of the\r\nPottawatomie, a narrowing wedge of territory that pointed at the heart of the\r\ntown where the two rivers met.\r\nAt the low log blockhouse—actually, more a storehouse than a fort—we\r\ncombined with Captain Parson’s small homeguard of boys and old men and\r\nspread out amongst the trees at the edge of the settlement and dug in there to\r\nawait the arrival of Reid’s men, with the river, at the one place where it\r\nbroadened and went shallow and was thus fordable, at our backs. “Never defend\r\nan unfordable river,” went one of Father’s maxims, “or the Lord may have to\r\npart the waters for you.” At one point, before we had dispersed and taken our\r\npositions in the woods behind rocks and logs, Father and I had a moment alone.\r\nWe were standing on a high, shrubby overlook, with the Marais des Cygnes\r\npassing below us. Father was seated on a stump, slowly sharpening his cutlass\r\nand every few seconds casting a wary eye up the trail, where we expected soon\r\nto see Reid and his men come riding in.\r\n“Why not pack everyone up and safely abandon this place, Father?” I asked\r\nhim. “Innocent lives will be lost defending it, and Reid’s going to take it\r\nanyway.”\r\n“The apostle saith, ‘Rebuke with all long suffering,’“ he answered without\r\nlooking up from his work. ‘“For the time will come when the people will not\r\nendure sound doctrine, and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and\r\nshall all be turned into fables.",
    "’“\r\nI sighed. “All right, fine. But tell me what you propose to accomplish here.”\r\n“Apotheosis, son. Apotheosis.”\r\n“You expect to die here?”\r\n“Oh, no! Just the opposite. God does not want me to die yet. He has something\r\nfurther for me to do. Something much larger. I know this.”\r\n“You know God’s mind?”\r\n“Yes,” he said, calm as a counting house clerk.\r\n“How do you come by this knowledge, Father?”\r\n“The Lord speaks to me. He shows me things. You know this, Owen,” he added\r\nwith some impatience.\r\nA moment passed in silence, while I pondered his claim—for this was the first\r\ntime that he had said it so bluntly—that not only did he see what the Lord\r\nwished him to see but he had God’s very words in his ear. Finally, I asked, “And\r\nwhat does the Lord say to you? What does He say of me, for instance?”\r\nHe turned his face up to me and gently smiled. “The Lord says that I shall\r\nnever weep for thee, as King David wept for his beloved son, Absalom. And as I\r\nmust weep for Frederick. And that I shall never wish to have died for thee, as\r\nKing David wished to die for Absalom. Today, Owen, the Lord hath delivered up\r\nthe men who hath raised their hand against me, and all who hath raised\r\nthemselves up against me to do me hurt shall someday be as that young man is.\r\nFrederick. My son.” He paused for a few seconds, then went on. “I swear it, and\r\nthe Lord hath promised it. For if I must, to smite these men I will carry this\r\nbattle into Africa.”\r\n“Africa,” I said.\r\n“You kill a serpent by striking off its head.”\r\nAfrica? Was my father, indeed and at last, mad? I was long used to his reliance\r\non elaborate, obscure figures and his habit of displacing the immediate present\r\nwith the Biblical past, and while usually I could follow his circumlocutious path\r\nto his meaning without much difficulty and often found his meaning original,\r\nprofound, and insightful, this time he had me.",
    " Africa! Had the shock of Fred’s\r\nmurder begun to settle in and madden him? He had so far evidenced no grief or\r\noutrage over it, but deep feelings too much denied or suppressed can\r\ninexplicably erupt in fissures elsewhere.\r\n“Look, they’re here!” he suddenly said, sounding almost relieved, and he stood\r\nand pointed towards the western track, where there came the first of Reid’s force\r\nover the horizon, and following close behind came a great troop of men on\r\nhorseback, riding three abreast and at full gallop. Father slapped his sword into\r\nits scabbard and instantly began giving orders. “Hold your fire, men! Aim low,\r\nand wait till they’re upon us!” he shouted, as he ran from one man to another,\r\nhis dozen fighters and Captain Parson’s twenty more, encouraging them and\r\nbucking up their courage in the face of this most formidable, terrifying force.\r\nStraight on the riders came, as if expecting no one to oppose them, as if we\r\nhad indeed done the rational, expected thing and abandoned the town to them.\r\nSoon they were only a quarter-mile off, well within range of our Sharps rifles, of\r\nwhich we had perhaps ten, and still Father said to hold fire, wait for his\r\ncommand, and then they were within range of our muskets, but he would not let\r\nus shoot yet, so we held back a few seconds longer, until they were fit targets\r\neven for our revolvers, when finally Father called, “Fire!” and thirty guns—thirty\r\nrifles, muskets, and revolvers—roared as one, and twenty or more of Reid’s men\r\ncried out and fell like clods of dirt. Those who were not hit in the fusillade\r\nwheeled away from the trail and, firing wildly from horseback, fled into the\r\nwoods in several directions at once, while we reloaded and went on shooting at\r\nthe riders and killing those on the ground who had gone down not dead but\r\nmerely wounded in the first volley.",
    "\r\nReid’s force was like a huge wave rolling in upon a rock. And when the riders\r\nhad fallen away before us and their ranks had broken on both our flanks, they at\r\nfirst swirled and scattered amongst the trees in confused eddies, then made their\r\ncircuitous way to a height back up the road a ways, well beyond the range of our\r\nguns, where they re-gathered in military formation, as if preparing to roll in\r\nagainst the rock a second time. Meanwhile, Father strode back and forth among\r\nhis hunkered men, making sure that no one had been shot and readying us for\r\nthe renewed attack, assuring us that the Lord would protect us and walking\r\nabout in full view of the enemy, as if he needed no such assurance himself.\r\nI lay tucked in behind a low, brush-covered hummock, studying through the\r\ngaps in the brush the moves of the enemy on the distant rise, when I saw one of\r\nReid’s men dismount and get down on one knee and carefully aim his long rifle\r\nin our direction. There was a puff of white smoke, then the sound of a single\r\ngunshot, and when I turned to see where the bullet might have hit, Father was\r\nstanding next to me, still recklessly exposed to the enemy.\r\nHe stepped close, turned, showed me his back, and said, “Can you see\r\nanything torn or bloody, Owen?”\r\nI replied that I could not.\r\n“Well, I believe I just took a terrible rap on the back from that fellow’s long\r\nrifle.”\r\n“What! Then stay down!”\r\nHe grinned and said, “Don’t fret yourself, son. The Lord doesn’t intend for me\r\nto be shot in the back. He just wants me to keep facing His enemy, that’s all. It’s\r\na little reminder.”\r\nI remember turning towards Reid’s men then and seeing for the first time their\r\ncannon. This was no guerilla skirmish; this was warfare. They had rolled the\r\nweapon out and were loading it with grapeshot.",
    " A moment later, they fired the\r\nthing, and it made a terrible roar, snapping off whole trees and tearing down\r\nbranches overhead. They quickly reloaded and fired a second time, with the\r\nsame, frightening effect. It made a deep bellow and then a shriek as the grape\r\nwhistled over our heads and crashed against the trees and hummocks,\r\nsplintering and smashing everything it hit. While the cannoneers with each new\r\nfiring brought their weapon closer and closer into deadly range, the rest of\r\nReid’s men, gathering courage from its destructive power, dismounted and\r\nformed large companies of shooters and commenced to advance on foot upon\r\nour position, stopping every ten or fifteen yards to aim and fire their muskets,\r\ndriving us slowly back towards the river.\r\nFather kept exhorting us to hold our ground and wait for close quarters and\r\naim low and so on, but first Captain Parson’s men and then Father’s, too, even\r\nSalmon and Oliver, were now in full retreat, firing and running, ducking behind\r\na tree or a rock and firing and running again. I stayed at the front beside Father\r\nand watched them fly past. Father and I looked at each other and said nothing.\r\nHere several of the men were shot and went down—older men: Mr. Partridge, as\r\nI recollect, and Mr. Holmes—and this terrified the rest even more and turned\r\ntheir more or less orderly retreat into a pandemonious rout, until finally even\r\nFather at this point gave up the fight and, showing the enemy his back, made for\r\nthe river, with me close behind.",
    "\r\nI remember stopping atop the bank, the last of the Osawatomie defenders to\r\nflee, and looking down at our men as they waded through the chest-high water,\r\nwith Father coming after, as if he were not following them but was in hot\r\npursuit—a revolver held high in each hand and his battered old palm-leaf hat set\r\nsquarely on his head and the tails of his mustard-yellow linen duster floating out\r\nbehind.\r\nHe cut a ludicrous figure. Except for those men—both ours and the enemy’s—\r\nwho lay dead on the rough ground behind me, they all did. It made no sense to\r\nme, none of it. I no longer knew what I was doing here or why. For a second, I\r\nthought of turning away from Father and the others and walking straight\r\ntowards Reid’s cannon and riflemen, offering myself up to them—as a prisoner,\r\nif they wanted, or as a sacrifice—just to end it, to finish this mad fight and give\r\nsense, if not to my life, then to my death. In a world where every man was trying\r\nfor no apparent reason to kill the other, the only sensible man should have long\r\nsince been slain. Like poor, murdered Fred.\r\nThen I heard Father’s hard voice call up to me: “Owen! God sees it, Owen! God\r\nsees it!” And with that, down the embankment I scrambled and into the river\r\nand on to the further bank—saved once again from myself by my father’s call to\r\ncome along, come and kill men another day.\r\nWe arrived late that evening, foot-sore, weary, and sullen, at Uncle’s cabin,\r\nwhich Reid’s marauders, having marked it already with Fred’s cold-blooded\r\nmurder, had passed over and left intact. Earlier, as we re-gathered on the far\r\nbank of the river, we had stood awhile and watched the smoke rise over the\r\nvillage of Osawatomie, where the Ruffians were gaily pillaging and burning.\r\nNow and then, the silence was broken by the whoops of the victors and the\r\nrandom sounds of their guns being fired exuberantly into the air.",
    " That there was\r\nstill in effect, despite contradicting claims on both sides, an unwritten law\r\nagainst violating or otherwise injuring women and children was cold comfort to\r\nus: houses and barns filled with the long, arduous summer’s harvest were going\r\nup in flames, and Free-State livestock was being herded together for travel east\r\nto feed hungry mouths in Missouri, and stores and the several public buildings\r\nwere being looted and burned to the ground. All over the region, the grassy\r\nplains and pretty cottonwood dells were scarred by the blackened ruins of\r\nfarmsteads and crossroads stores, and the trails and roads were increasingly\r\nhaunted by the wagons of burned-out Free-Staters and pro-slavery families alike\r\nreturning with their few remaining possessions and animals to their home states\r\n—ruined by this war, slump-shouldered, disillusioned, and broken.\r\nUncle was alone in his cabin when we arrived. Having determined to stay and\r\nminister to his tiny flock, he had long since sent his wife, Flora, Father’s half-\r\nsister, on back to Ohio for the duration of the hostilities. In spite of his\r\nconnection to us Browns and of having briefly harbored John and Jason after the\r\nPottawatomie massacre, he had managed, by virtue of his simple decency and\r\neven-handedness in all his dealings, to escape persecution by the roving bands of\r\nRuffians. There are all sorts of Christians, and Uncle Sam Adair was, to my mind,\r\na simple Christian, for, although he hated slavery, he regarded all human beings\r\nas equally fallen from grace and equally capable of salvation. He was thus\r\nessentially pacifistic, like Jason, and did not believe that it was necessary to kill\r\npeople in order to free others. From the beginning, this had separated Uncle\r\nfrom Father, although Uncle was not severe about it—except, of course, for a\r\nspell following the Pottawatomie killings.",
    " So while he did not exactly welcome\r\nus into his home that night, he nonetheless permitted us to enter and view Fred’s\r\nbody and make the necessary determinations for his burial.\r\nThe main room of the cabin was dimly lit by a single oil lantern and a low fire\r\nin the fireplace. We crowded in—Father, Salmon, Oliver, and I—and stood\r\nfacing the long table where Uncle had laid out the body. He had put Fred’s boots\r\nback on him and his shirt, buttoned to the throat, and had washed and shaved\r\nhis face, so that Fred seemed almost to be sleeping. Fred in repose and in that\r\nflickering light had an angelic face, soft and pink and round, more like our\r\nmother’s than Father’s. There was something, not female, but decidedly feminine\r\nin Fred; in this he was not much like his father or brothers, we who seemed so\r\nwholly masculine, unyielding, and crude. Even when a stoical, solitary shepherd\r\nin Ohio, where he had resembled no man so much as John the Baptist in the\r\nwilderness, Fred had had about him a delicacy and finesse, a physical sweetness,\r\nthat had set him apart from other men in a way that, after his self-mutilation,\r\nbecame even more pronounced than before: somehow, that most violent and\r\nmost masculine act of self-reproach, in Fred’s hand, had looked nearly gentle,\r\nand it had neither frightened nor embarrassed any of us. We had been saddened\r\nby it, of course, but not intimidated, as we would have been if one of our other\r\nbrothers had done it.\r\nI cannot say what Father thought or felt that night as he looked down on\r\nFred’s body. He did not weep, nor for a long while did he say anything. Always,\r\nas regards his children, Father’s thoughts and feelings were strong, but they were\r\nalso at times somewhat gnarled and stunted, as if our very existence were a\r\nchastizement to him.",
    " When a decent amount of time had passed in silence, Uncle\r\ncleared his throat and coughed nervously and said, “Would you like me to say\r\nthe prayers for the lad, John?”\r\nAt first, Father did not respond; then he slowly shook his head no. I looked at\r\nhis face and saw again that there was something newly broken in him: a piece of\r\nhis mind that hitherto had been intact was now cast off from it, and he was no\r\nlonger merely suppressing his emotions, his rage and grief, saving them for a\r\nlater, more appropriate hour and place: his mind now was less a finely calibrated\r\nengine than a monument: it had become like chiseled stone, cut and carved in a\r\npermanent way, and I saw that what Father did not express he did not feel.\r\nHe stepped away from Fred’s body and, passing between us, went to the door\r\nand said for Uncle to bury Fred here on the property and to mark it properly\r\nwith his name and dates. “And say upon it the words of the apostle, ‘For whom\r\nthe Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.’”\r\nThen, abruptly, he asked Uncle how many horses he had.\r\n“A pair,” Uncle told him. “And I still have a mule.”\r\n“I will need them, along with your wagon. I’ll replace them in a few days. The\r\nboys and I have an appointment with some Ruffians, and I don’t want to\r\ndisappoint them by arriving late.” It was his intention, he said, to nip awhile at\r\nthe flanks and heels of Reid’s army, until we had ourselves fresh mounts and\r\nsupplies, and then he would come back around, before heading into Africa.\r\nUncle looked at him with the same bewildered amazement as I had earlier.\r\n“Africa, John? What are you saying?”\r\n“You will know it when I’ve done it;’ Father said.",
    " And at that I suddenly\r\nremembered his old plan, his Subterranean Passway into the South, and I finally\r\nunderstood his meaning and knew that for him, and lor us, this dismal,\r\nmurderous war in Kansas was nearly finished.\r\n“Come on, boys,” he said. “Your brother is with the Lord. You’ll see him again\r\nsoon enough.” Then he stepped from the cabin into the night, and we trooped\r\nsilently after.\r\nChapter 21\r\nThere commenced then a lengthy period which in hindsight could be called the\r\ncalm before the storm, although we did not know then that the storm was truly\r\ncoming, even though Father increasingly predicted it. He never said the name of\r\nthe place, Harpers Ferry, Virginia, the town down in the very heart of the\r\nSlavocracy where the federal government manufactured its famed Sharps rifles.\r\nHe called it Africa. But we knew roughly the place he meant and that a new,\r\nmore dangerous, and more consequential work on a different front was about to\r\nbegin.\r\nAnd having come to this point in my account, dear Miss Mayo, where begin\r\nthe more publically known and recorded events in Father’s life, let me declare\r\nthat I wish only to tell you here what you cannot more easily and reliably learn\r\nelsewhere from the now hundreds of published histories and memoirs of those\r\ndays half a century gone. My memory for facts, dates, names, and so on is not\r\nsharp; it never was: you don’t need me for those anyhow. But my feelings and\r\nemotions, my whole sensibility, are today, as I scribble here in my cabin, the\r\nsame as they were back then. I fear that is all I have now to offer you.",
    " It is as if I\r\nhave throughout these intervening years been insensible to everything that has\r\nsince then occurred or passed before me, and I am today in my brain and heart\r\nthe very same man I was a half-century ago, a man suffering incoherently\r\nthrough each new day, whether in North Elba or Kansas or Virginia, with no\r\nsure knowledge of what the next day will bring. I am still a man stuck in that\r\nsame, old killing game, a man who—having contrived to set his father in motion\r\nand having shaped matters in such a way as to set the Old Man onto a bloody\r\ntrack straight to perdition, or at least to purgatory—is condemned to follow him\r\nthere and, if possible, with these words, with the truthfulness of this account,\r\nwith this confession of my intentions, my desires, and my secret acts, finally to\r\nrelease him. I want Father’s soul to be free of me at last, and mine to be free of\r\nhim, regardless of where from this purgatory we each afterwards must go.\r\nI wonder sometimes if you can understand this. And if you can accept and make\r\nuse of it. Oh, I know that there is a public reality and a private reality and that\r\nmy best use—for you, for me, and for all those lingering ghosts as well—has\r\nbeen to keep to the private and ignore the rest. But even so, I do want my story,\r\nif possible, to impinge upon the public reality, on history, and I mean here and\r\nthere to tell it accordingly.",
    " For instance, it has become almost a commonplace in\r\nrecent years to say that Father, like many Christians of his generation, began as a\r\nprincipled, religious-minded young Northern man agitated by Negro slavery in\r\nthe South and racialism everywhere, and that, like many such men, he\r\nunderstandably became in middle-age an actively engaged opponent of slavery\r\nand racialism, but that in his old age he changed, suddenly and inexplicably,\r\ninto a free-booting guerilla, whence he moved swiftly on to become a terrorist\r\nand finally, astonishingly, a martyr. Thus, looking back through a glass colored\r\nby the Civil War, most Americans nowadays find his actions incomprehensible,\r\nand they call him mad, or wish to. So while I’m here to tell you certain things\r\nthat you cannot otherwise know, I also wish to remind you that Father’s\r\nprogression from activist to martyr, his slow march to willed disaster, can be\r\nviewed, not as a descent into madness, but as a reasonable progression—\r\nespecially if one consider the political strength of those who in those days meant\r\nto keep chattel slavery the law of the land. Remember, all-out war between the\r\nNorth and the South was unthinkable to us: due to an ancient, deeply ingrained\r\nracialism, any war undertaken by the citizens of the North for the purpose of\r\nfreeing an enslaved people whose skins were black seemed a pure impossibility.\r\nWe believed instead that the Northerners—when it finally came clear to them\r\nwhat we already knew, that the South now wholly owned the government of the\r\nnation—would simply secede from the Union, leaving behind a nation in which\r\na huge number of our fellow Americans and all their unborn progeny were\r\nchattel slaves: literal, unrepatriated prisoners-of-war. Before that could happen,\r\nwe meant to liberate as many of them as possible.",
    " And failing that, failing to free\r\nour prisoners-of-war prior to the eventual and, as it seemed to us, inevitable\r\ncessation of hostilities between the Northern and Southern states, the one side\r\ncowardly and the other evil, we meant to slay every slaveholder we could lay\r\nour hands on. And those whose throats we could not reach directly or whose\r\nheads we could not find in the sights of our guns, we would terrorize from afar,\r\nhoping thereby to rouse them to bloody acts of reprisal, which might in turn\r\nstraighten the spines of our Northern citizenry and bring a few of them over to\r\nour side.\r\nWe did not want the North to secede from the Union and make its own slave-\r\nfree republic or join with Canada in some new, colonized relation to Olde\r\nEngland or even make with Canada an independent, slave-free nation of the\r\nnorth. And it never once occurred to us that the Southerners would leave the\r\nUnion. They didn’t have to. They already owned the entire machinery of\r\ngovernment in Washington and in those years, the late ’50s, were merely\r\nsolidifying and making permanent their control of it by carrying slavery into the\r\nwestern territories. In our own way, with no knowledge of the coming Civil War,\r\nwe were fighting to preserve the American Republic.\r\nBut I was speaking of my father’s gradual progression from antislavery agitator\r\nall the way to terrorist, guerilla captain, and martyr, how it seemed—not in\r\nhindsight, but at the time of its occurrence—a reasonable and moral response to\r\nthe times and to the deep, continuous frustration they created. Father may have\r\nbeen the first to resort to pure terrorism for political and military purposes, but\r\nthe wisdom and necessity of it were early on as plain to the other side as to us:\r\nthey never needed our example to inspire them to butcher innocent civilians.",
    "\r\nAnd without Father, that’s what I would have been, merely an innocent civilian,\r\nwifeless, childless, and alone, a Northern bachelor tending his flock of merinos\r\nout on the rolling, grassy shoulder of the Marais des Cygnes a few miles from the\r\nabolitionist enclave of Osawatomie—easy pickings for one of the roving,\r\ndrunken bands of Ruffians, who would have treated me as they treated so many\r\nother isolated Free-State farmers and herdsmen: they’d have shot me dead,\r\nburned my cabin, stolen off my sheep and horse, and ridden on to the next\r\nfarmstead.\r\nSometimes I think it would have been better for me, for Father, for our entire\r\nfamily, for everyone, if it had happened that way. Better for everyone, perhaps,\r\nif, back in Springfield, when Father gave me leave to go my own way and not\r\nreturn to North Elba, I had gone. “Just go, Owen, follow your elder brothers to\r\nOhio and beyond, if that’s what you prefer, or follow the elephant and go to\r\nCaliforn-i-ay in search of gold, if that interests you!” If I had taken him at his\r\nword and, with his permission, had forsaken what he called my duty, so many\r\nterrible things would never have happened: the death of Lyman Epps; Fred’s self-\r\nmutilation and migration with me to Kansas; and Father’s, and Salmon’s,\r\nOliver’s, and Henry Thompson’s, migration there, too, for without me and Fred\r\nin tow, John and Jason and their families surely would have given up that first\r\ncruel winter and come home to Ohio; and then there would have been no\r\nPottawatomie killings and possibly no war at all in the Kansas Territory, which\r\nin ’58 would have come into the Union as a slave state instead of a free, an event\r\nsurely to be followed by the secession of most of the northern states and their\r\nprobable, eventual union with Canada. There would have been no debacle at\r\nHarpers Ferry. No Civil War.\r\nThink of it!",
    " Father would have ended his days peacefully in the manner he so\r\noften wished, as a farmer and preacher in North Elba, aiding and instructing his\r\nwhite and Negro neighbors, dying in old age in his bed, surrounded by his\r\nbeloved family, and buried in the shade of his favorite mountain, Tahawus, the\r\nCloudsplitter.\r\nIs it ridiculous and grandiose to speculate this way? To think that so much\r\ndepends upon so little? Miss Mayo, I think it’s no more ridiculous or grandiose\r\nthan to believe that our trivial lives here on earth are watched over and fated by\r\nan all-seeing, all-knowing God. But cannot the law of cause-and-effect be\r\nrationally thought to operate from the ground up, as well as from the top down?\r\nAnd if there is an order to the universe, then all our affairs here on earth are,\r\nsurely, inextricably linked one to the other. I believe that the universe is like a\r\ndesert, and each of our lives is a grain of sand that touches three or four adjacent\r\nto it, and when one grain turns in the wind or is moved or adjusted even\r\nslightly, those next to it will move also, and they in turn will shift the others\r\nnext to each of them, and so on, all across the vast, uncountable billions of\r\ngrains in the desert, until over time a great storm arises and alters the face of the\r\nplanet. So why should I forbid myself from believing that my single action, or\r\neven my inaction, one day in my youth in my father’s warehouse in Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts, altered history? And that it was instrumental in shaping, not only\r\nmy destiny, but Father’s, too, and my entire family’s, and even, if I may be\r\nforgiven this vision, the destiny of an entire people?\r\nWhich is why I did what I did—why I returned that fall from Springfield to the\r\nfarm in North Elba, why I went there to do my duty.",
    " For even if we cannot know\r\nthe ultimate consequences of our actions or inactions, we must nonetheless\r\nbehave as if they do have ultimate consequences. No little thing in our lives is\r\nwithout meaning; never mind that we can never know it ourselves. I did what I\r\ndid, my duty, in order to free the slaves. I did it to change history. It is finally\r\nthat simple. My immediate motives, of course, at every step of the way were like\r\neveryone else’s, even Father’s—mixed, often confused and selfish, and frequently\r\nunknown even to me until many years later. But so long as I was doing my duty,\r\nso long as I was acting on the principles that I had learned when a child, then I\r\nwas bending my life to free the slaves: I was shaping and curving it like a barrel\r\nstave that would someday fit with other lives similarly bent, so as to construct a\r\nvessel capable of measuring out and transporting into the future the history of\r\nour time and place. It would be a history capable of establishing forever the true\r\nnature and meaning of the nineteenth century in the United States of America,\r\nand thus would my tiny life raise a storm that would alter the face of the planet.\r\nFather’s God-fearing, typological vision of the events that surrounded us then\r\nwas not so different from mine. My vision may have been secular and his\r\nBiblical, but neither was materialistic. They were both, perhaps, versions of Mr.\r\nEmerson’s grand, over-arching, transcendental vision, just not so clearly or\r\npoetically expressed. At least in my case. In Father’s, I’m not so sure, for the\r\nBible is nothing if not clear and poetical.\r\nIn a sense, I suppose that what I am inscribing on these pages is the Secret\r\nHistory of John Brown. You may, of course, do with it what you wish, or do\r\nnothing with it, if it seems worthless to you and Professor Villard.",
    " As I have said,\r\nwe each will have very different uses for it anyhow, uses shaped by those to\r\nwhom we each imagine we are telling our respective tales. For you and the\r\nprofessor, it is told to present and future generations of students of the history of\r\nnineteenth-century America; for me, it is being told to the dead, the long dead\r\nand buried companions of my past. And told especially to my dead father.\r\nYour history of John Brown, however, will be of no use to the dead. It is for\r\nthe living and the unborn: you are in the business of creating received\r\nknowledge. I am in the business of coming along behind and correcting it. I\r\nremind you of this for several reasons, but mostly so that you will understand\r\nthat what I leave out of my account is all that I see no reason to correct or to\r\nenlarge upon. Simply put, I accept the truth of whatever is absent from these\r\npages.\r\nAnd for that reason, you will not find here any further description of the war\r\nin Kansas, even though it continued to burn beyond the so-called Battle of\r\nOsawatomie for fully another year and a half, before finally flickering down to a\r\ncharred pile of ash in the winter of ’58, with the Free-State forces arrived at last\r\nin exhausted ascendancy. By then, Father’s and my attentions were elsewhere.\r\nHis attention was on the Eastern sources of funding for his African Campaign, as\r\nhe had come to call it; mine was on the recruitment and training, in our secret\r\nencampment at Tabor, Iowa, of the young men who would follow Father into\r\nAfrica, and the long, broody wait for him to signal that the moment to attack\r\nhad at last arrived.",
    " Also not here: Father’s lengthy visits and planning sessions\r\nduring the spring and summer of ’57 and all throughout ’58 with Frederick\r\nDouglass in Rochester, New York, and Gerrit Smith in Peterboro; and, over in\r\nMassachusetts, his fiery speeches at Springfield, Worcester, Medford, Concord,\r\nand Boston; and his stay in Concord with the distinguished authors Messrs.\r\nEmerson, Thoreau, Higginson, and Sanborn, all of whom have since published\r\nwhat I assume to be truthful accounts of Father’s appearance, words, and\r\ndeportment there. By then, his apotheosis was nearly completed anyhow, and he\r\nwas to everyone he met a grand, Cromwellian figure transfigured in the glow of\r\ntheir lofty, optimistic thought. But I was not myself present at any of those\r\nmeetings so cannot know how, in fact, he behaved.\r\nI do not include here anything that I myself know nothing of or know only\r\nthrough hearsay. For instance, Father’s journey to Canada in April and May of\r\n’58, where, at the famous Chatham Convention of Negro leaders, he first\r\npresented to the public, as it were, his plan for the Subterranean Passway and\r\nobtained from the most prominent Negroes, Frederick Douglass and the\r\nReverends Loguen and Garnet and Harriet Tubman and others of that radical ilk,\r\nthe same sort of trust and financial support that he had earlier secured in private\r\nfrom the radical whites in New York and New England. It was at Chatham that\r\nhe recruited into our little army its first Negro member, Osborn Anderson. Later,\r\nof course, as you may know by now, there were four other Negroes who went\r\nthe full route with us, courageous, doomed men—the mulatto Lewis Leary and\r\nhis nephew John Copeland, who had been a student at Oberlin College in Ohio;\r\nand the splendid Dangerfield Newby; and Frederick Douglass’s friend and valet,\r\nShields Green, of whom, despite his willingness to abandon Mr.",
    " Douglass and\r\nfollow Father, I had no particularly high opinion, and of that I may later write. I\r\nhave at this moment no desire to puncture Shields’s somewhat inflated\r\nreputation, for he was young and ignorant and surely did not realize what he\r\nhad let himself in for, when he left his protector and went down with Father into\r\n“the steel trap!’ as Mr. Douglass called it. He died horribly. One must, as long as\r\none remains alive, forgive the dead everything.\r\nThere is, of course, the well-known story of Father’s seeking out and recruiting\r\nin New York City Mr. Hugh Forbes, the conceited British journalist who had\r\naccompanied us on shipboard from Boston to Liverpool and by carriage to\r\nLondon during our ill-fated voyage abroad. That sordid story has been told often\r\nelsewhere, told more by Father’s enemies than by his friends, probably because\r\nof its tendency to portray Father as a deluded old man or, at best, as disastrously\r\nnaive. I’m reluctant to enter it here, however, because Forbes, too, like Shields\r\nGreen, may be dead by now, and I had few dealings with him myself and from\r\nthe start viewed him as a callow, cynical, pompous man and a dissembler. But\r\nthen, I was never so innocent as Father, especially when it came to a certain type\r\nof man, of which Forbes was a prime example—the carefully reticent, smooth-\r\ntalking fellow with a casual claim to experiences and knowledge that, to Father,\r\nwere cosmopolitan, which is to say, European.",
    " And because he did not boast in\r\nthe usual loud American way of having fought alongside Mazzini and Garibaldi\r\nin Italy and of composing a military handbook for the Austrian army and\r\nreporting on the cataclysmic events in Europe in ’48 for the New York Herald and\r\nhis own periodical, The European, but instead implied and insinuated them into\r\nconversation in the educated British way, the Old Man, the rough-cut Yankee\r\nauto-didact, believed him and hired him on as our only salaried recruit. He even\r\ncommissioned the velvety fellow with the rank of colonel and sent him west to\r\nTabor to drill and train his troop of young, ragtag volunteers, all of whom by\r\nthen were hardened veterans of the Kansas campaign and needed, not drilling\r\nexercises, but weaponry, supplies, and more fighting men. We certainly did not\r\nneed a man like Forbes, Colonel Forbes, telling us what to do.\r\nLittle matter, for he did not turn up in Iowa for months anyhow, and when he\r\nfinally arrived, he was mainly taken up with the composition of his military\r\nhandbook for the coming American anti-slavery revolution, which, thanks to\r\nFather, he was convinced was imminent, a volume that, as soon as it was\r\nproperly published, he expected to see purchased and eagerly read by all\r\nAmericans, north and south, and by Europeans, too. He expected this book to\r\nmake his personal fortune.\r\nThough Forbes was the first, he was the most transparent of the many men\r\nwho tried to exploit Father for personal, financial gain. There was also the\r\ngrowing number of journalists who wrote for the Eastern newspapers and\r\nperiodicals and now followed Father every-where and sent back to their editors\r\nlavishly embellished accounts of the Old Man’s adventures in Kansas and his\r\npublic appearances in New York and New England.",
    " Father had taken to traveling\r\nunder the name of Shubel Morgan again, ostensibly to conceal his identity from\r\nfederal officers still seeking to arrest him for his actions in Kansas, and wore the\r\nlong white beard with which after his death he was so famously portrayed; but\r\nunder any name and in whatever disguise, the comings and goings of\r\nOsawatomie Brown were by now well-known to the press, for he had become a\r\ncolorful character, one whom all Americans enjoyed reading about, regardless of\r\ntheir views on slavery. With these journalists I have little quarrel, however, for\r\nquite as effectively as they exploited him, Father exploited them back by using\r\ntheir vivid, exaggerated stories of his military exploits and his spiritual and\r\nmoral clarity to advertise and confirm his own accounts of his bravery, personal\r\nsacrifice, and character.\r\nMost of the other profiteers—at least until later, after Harpers Ferry, when the\r\nsale of Father’s personal letters and effects and the odd, cast-off article of\r\nclothing or weapon became as lucrative as the sale of portions of the True Cross\r\n—were small fellows, merchants, mainly, and tradesmen out to extract from\r\nFather’s purse as much as the market would bear for guns and bullets, sabers and\r\nsaddles and other war supplies. Exploiting a market inflated by the Old Man’s\r\nneeds for secrecy and speed of delivery, they picked Father’s pocket, which had\r\nbeen filled and re-filled again and again by his now-loyal cadre of Eastern\r\ngentlemen of means, men who had finally decided that Father was right, that the\r\nwar against slavery would have to be carried into Africa, and Osawatomie\r\nBrown was the only man to do it. They were Mr. Gerrit Smith, as always, and Dr.\r\nHowe and Messrs. Lawrence, Stearns, Sanborn, and Higginson. Good men, all, if\r\nnot personally courageous.",
    " And I do not fault them for denying Father in the\r\nweeks and months immediately following the uproar at Harpers Ferry, any more\r\nthan one can fault Peter for denying Christ. Later, in the aftermath of the Civil\r\nWar, they did return to his side and glorified his memory with more than\r\nappropriate praise.\r\nForbes, though, was a cat with a different coat. And I’m reminded by that\r\nfigure that he wore a green velvet jacket and fringed doeskin boots and affected\r\na cane with a silver knob. He even sported an ostrich feather in his hatband. All\r\nof which made him look ridiculous out there in Iowa, especially when he pulled\r\na face and moaned about the fate of his poor wife and babes, who were\r\nsupposedly living in abject poverty back in Paris, France. He claimed that their\r\nsacrifice was made so that he could continue with his noble mission of assisting\r\nand guiding Osawatomie Brown in the great attempt to liberate the American\r\nslaves. He declared that he was personally re-writing American history.\r\nHe actually said this to me himself. It was out in Tabor, in April of ’59, when\r\nwe were holed up at the farm of a Quaker supporter of Father’s, a man originally\r\nfrom Indiana who believed that we were preparing, not for war, but for a\r\nmassive flight of Negro refugees out of the South—which was essentially true,\r\nalthough our intended means to foment that flight were unlikely to have met\r\nwith any Quaker’s approval. Perhaps, like so many self-proclaimed pacifists gone\r\nbone-weary of battling the pro-slavers’ endless stratagems and violence, he had\r\nintuited our true plans and welcomed them, but did not wish to be told of them\r\nin any detail. Regardless, all that winter and into the spring, he had allowed our\r\nshabby troop of sometimes twenty, sometimes fewer than ten, to ensconce itself\r\nsecretly in his barn by night and train in his fields by day.",
    " There Forbes had us\r\nmarching up and down like toy soldiers, mainly it seemed for the pleasure he got\r\nfrom hearing his own British gentleman’s voice bark orders at American country-\r\nboys.\r\nI remember the April afternoon when, all sweaty and covered with dirt and\r\nseeds and thistles from the fields and gullies that we had spent the day\r\nconquering for our colonel, I left the other men and, approaching Forbes, asked\r\nif I could speak with him privately. He was seated in the shade of a cottonwood\r\ntree on a stool he had borrowed from the Quaker’s kitchen and, without looking\r\nup from the papers on his lap, said to me, “It’s appropriate, Lieutenant, when\r\nrequesting permission to speak, to salute your superior officer and address him\r\nby rank.”\r\nHe had been with us only a week by then, but already I was sick of him, and\r\nthe other men downright despised him and were starting to blame Father for his\r\npresence among us. John Kagi had declared the night before that he was ready\r\nto shoot the fellow dead, and only my loyalty to Father had kept me from\r\nrunning him straight off the place myself. That and my fear that, if he were\r\novertly resisted by us, he would at once turn on us and reveal Father’s plans to\r\nthe federal authorities—which, as is now well-known, he eventually did. It is\r\ntrue: months before it took place, Forbes came close to ending the raid on\r\nHarpers Ferry. Luckily—or, as it turned out, perhaps unluckily—no one in the\r\ngovernment or the press believed then that any man, not even the notorious\r\nterrorist Osawatomie Brown, would contemplate mounting a privately financed\r\narmed raid on a federal weapons manufactory and depot in the fortified heart of\r\nthe South. Thus, after Forbes turned on us and until the raid itself finally\r\noccurred, his words bore no credence with anyone on either side, which is what\r\nsaved us for another day.",
    " By then, of course, he was seen as a fellow conspirator\r\nhimself and was pursued by the government and fled into England, where he\r\nmay indeed be living today, an old dandy in doeskin boots, dining out on stories\r\nof his early involvement with the famous American anti-slavery guerilla leader\r\nand martyr, Osawatomie Brown. I suppose it’s on that possibility that I criticize\r\nhim now.\r\nOut there in Iowa, despite his constant admonitions, I neither saluted Forbes\r\nnor addressed him by rank. I said straight out that the men and I were faithful to\r\nFather and to our common cause, but I could no longer assure him that one or\r\nmore of the men would not shoot him. I emphasized, so as to make my own\r\nposition clear, that his murder would be a betrayal of Father’s wishes and\r\ndetrimental to our common cause. His murder by one of us could undo us\r\naltogether. I wanted him to know who and what were keeping him alive.\r\n“You’re quite serious, Brown.”\r\n“Quite, Forbes.”\r\nHe still had not looked up at me. “You know what I’m writing here, Brown?”\r\nI knew very well: he had held forth on the virtues of his tract numerous times.\r\n“A military manual,” I said.\r\n“Yes. But more than that, Brown. It’s a manual, all right, but one composed\r\nspecifically for the use of men fighting to end slavery in America. And like all\r\nsuch manuals, it’s a history of the time and place of its own composition. D’ you\r\nunderstand that, Brown?”\r\n“You mean it’s about us. And about you.”\r\n“Precisely. And the chapter I’m presently engaged in writing is called ‘The\r\nAmerican Garibaldi,’ which is concerned with nothing less than the necessity\r\nand means of transforming ordinary citizens into soldiers. Of transforming\r\npeasants—ignorant farmers, laborers, woodcutters, and the like—into disciplined\r\nsoldiers.",
    " Now, what do you suppose General Garibaldi would have done if one of\r\nhis Italian lieutenants had come up and spoken to him as you have just spoken\r\nto me?”\r\n“Well, Forbes, I don’t rightly know.”\r\n“No. No, you don’t. That’s the point. Y’see, I know things that you don’t.\r\nWhich is precisely why your father hired me on and commissioned me with the\r\nrank of colonel.” Here he digressed awhile to complain of Father’s not having\r\npaid him as he had promised, along with some sorrowful reminders of poor Mrs.\r\nForbes and his hungry babes in Paris, France, until at last he returned to the\r\nsubject at hand—mutiny. “General Garibaldi,” he said, “would have instructed\r\nhis Lieutenant, as I am you, that it was the lieutenant’s responsibility, not the\r\ngeneral’s, to put down any potential mutiny. And if the lieutenant could not do\r\nit, then the lieutenant himself would be regarded as mutinous and would be\r\nperemptorily shot by firing squad.”\r\nI looked back at the boys lounging in the field behind me and could scarcely\r\nkeep a straight lace at the thought of Forbes ordering them to stand in formation\r\nfor my execution. “Hed have said that, eh? The general.”\r\n‘Yes, Brown. And then, just as I myself am about to do, he would have stood\r\nand left his lieutenant to ponder that statement, and he would have brooked no\r\nfurther discussion on the subject of mutiny.” Forbes closed his writing book and,\r\nas predicted by himself, stood and walked off towards the barn, leaving me, like\r\nGeneral Garibaldi’s lieutenant, to ponder his statement.\r\nForbes surprised me, though, for that was the last I ever saw of him. I said\r\nnothing to the men of my strange conversation with our colonel, and after a\r\nwhile we all wandered back to the barn and washed and, as usual, prepared our\r\nfrugal evening meal of hoecakes and stew, until finally someone noticed that\r\nForbes was nowhere about.",
    " His horse was gone, and all his gear. “Good\r\nriddance,” Kagi muttered, and all concurred. Without meaning to, I had scared\r\nthe fellow off. He took himself so seriously that I had taken him a bit seriously\r\nmyself, or perhaps I might have humored and endured him longer and spared us\r\nmuch risk afterwards.\r\nLater, I learned where he had gone—east to New York City, thence to\r\nWashington, where he had commenced his vain campaign to betray Father to\r\nour enemies. In time, Father learned of Forbes’s failed attempts to convince the\r\nSecretary of War and the various newspapers of our plan—thanks to a flurry of\r\nfrightened letters from friendly abolitionists in the War Department and the\r\njournalist Mr. Redpath, who at once told Messrs. Smith and Higginson and Dr.\r\nHowe. Typically, they panicked, but to the Old Man, Forbes’s attempted betrayal\r\nwas a positive development, as it had created amongst our supporters a greater\r\nurgency for the battle to begin at once. And, further, the peculiarly deaf ears of\r\nthe War Secretary and the others to whom Forbes had spoken only confirmed in\r\nFather’s mind that God was still his protector, and by winnowing Forbes out, the\r\nLord had merely been correcting Father’s error in having judged the man useful\r\nyears earlier when they first met.\r\nIn his letter to me, summoning me and the rest of the troop to disperse to our\r\nrespective homes and await his marching orders, he told me all this. He ended\r\nhis long letter by writing, I believe that the Lord was merely testing my acumen, as\r\nwell as my faith, back then, as He always does. And in the unpleasant matter of Mr.\r\nForbes, the Lord hath found me sadly wanting. But now, thanks to the steady\r\nincrease in my faith and trust in Him, the Almighty hath again protected me from\r\nmy own folly. Now, come directly home to North Elba, son, he wrote.",
    " The Lord is\r\nmaking it so that we must act quickly’.\r\nAnd so, once again, this time for the last time, I came through the Cascade\r\nNotch from the wilderness village of Keene into North Elba and, out there on the\r\nfreshly greening Plains of Abraham, set up on the rise just beyond the bulky\r\nshadow of Father’s beloved Mount Tahawus, sighted our family farm. So sweetly\r\nself-contained and four-square it seemed in the pale June light that I dared not\r\nrecall to my mind my gloomy reasons for having returned here—for it was\r\nmerely to say goodbye, perhaps forever, to my beloved brothers, those who\r\nwould not accompany Father and me south, and to my dear sisters and\r\nstepmother, who had already endured so much for us and would soon endure\r\nunimaginably more, and to the place itself, where, to all intents and purposes, I\r\nhad grown in my cumbersome way into manhood.\r\nI think back to those olden days now as I thought back to them then and\r\napproach the doorway of the house as I approached it then, with fear and literal\r\ntrembling, for so much has changed in the intervening years, the years since the\r\ndeath of Lyman Epps and my flight into the West and my return today, so much\r\nhas changed in the world at large, and yet I myself have not been altered—I am\r\nstill that same, half-cracked man, Owen Brown, lurching forward into history on\r\nthe heels of his father, resolving all his private, warring emotions and conflicted\r\npassions in the larger, public war against slavery, making the miserable,\r\ninescapable violence of his temperament appear useful and principled by aiming\r\nit, not at himself, where perhaps it properly belonged, but at his father’s\r\ndemonized opponents. For otherwise, how would I have turned out but as a\r\nsuicide?\r\nAnd having admitted that, I suddenly understand what must follow upon the\r\ncompletion of my confession!",
    " For then I will, at last, have no longer a reason to\r\nlive. I will be ready to become a ghost myself, so as to replace in purgatory the\r\nlong-suffering ghosts this confession has been designed expressly to release.\r\nDear Miss Mayo, since I wrote the lines above, I have been briefly away from my\r\ntable, searching through the rubble of my cabin for my old revolver, my sidearm\r\nin Kansas and at Harpers Ferry and the long, furtive years of flight afterwards. I\r\nlocated it at last in a cache of Father’s letters from ’55 and ’56 (which I had\r\npreviously overlooked and promise now to send to you when I finally gather and\r\nsend on all the scattered pages of this sorry, disheveled account), and when I\r\ncame upon it there in a corner beneath my cot—along with some two dozen\r\nrounds of ammunition—I confess that I felt a strange, new kind of glee. I know\r\nnot what else to call it than glee: it is a peculiar, altogether unfamiliar emotion\r\nto me.\r\nI have placed the revolver, my old Colt .45, now cleaned and loaded, upon the\r\nwriting table, and every time I come to the end of a sentence, I look up from the\r\npage and see the weapon there, waiting patiently as an old friend set to take me\r\non a journey, and I feel again that exotic, anticipatory glee.\r\nIt is late summer—here and everywhere that my mind goes—and the mowing\r\nhas evidently been interrupted by this morning’s rain, and the deserted fields\r\nglisten silvery in the sun as I pass along between them, on horseback then, in my\r\nmind and memory now, making my slow way through the notch and over the\r\nPlains towards the farm. The storm clouds have broken and blown away to the\r\neast, leaving great, spreading shreds and swaths of deep blue sky.",
    " Off to my left\r\nand behind me looms the craggy granite peak whose very name I cannot let\r\nenter my mind without Father’s dark face also entering there, for I have come\r\nover the years so to associate the two, as if each, mountain and man, were a\r\nportrait of the other and the two, reduced to their simplest outlines, were a\r\nsingle, runic inscription which I must, before I die, decipher, or I will not know\r\nthe meaning of my own existence or its worth.\r\nThere is no one in the fields and no other person on the narrow dirt track\r\ncoming my way towards the farm or from it towards me, and no cattle or kine or\r\nhorses grazing in the pastures and pens. No dogs and none of the fine, blooded,\r\nmerino sheep whose dams and sires Father brought up from Springfield in the\r\nspring of ’50, when we first settled here. No smoke rises from the chimneys of\r\nthe house or from the tanning shed or from Lyman’s old forge, and except for the\r\nthin rattle of the frigid waters of the Au Sable over rock in the wooded valley\r\nbelow and the shudder of the breeze amongst the topmost branches of the\r\nancient pines towering on the slopes above me, there is no sound—no one is\r\ncutting wood or hammering nails anywhere in earshot, no one digs a well or a\r\npit or ditch, no one opens or closes a door or a window. Even the birds—silent as\r\nghosts!",
    "\r\nFather wrote that he would meet me at the farm, that we would all meet in\r\nNorth Elba—we in the family who will go down into Africa together: my brother\r\nWatson, only twenty-four years old, who returned here to the farm after his turn\r\nin Kansas and Iowa ahead of me and who will die miserably in Father’s arms of\r\ngunshot wounds in less than four months’ time; and our youngest brother,\r\nOliver, a boy of twenty-one and already battle-hardened from the Kansas\r\ncampaign, but bookish withal and about to marry a daughter of the Brewster\r\nfamily nearby, a girl who will be a widow before turning twenty; and two of my\r\nbrothers-in-law from the Thompson clan, William and Dauphin, whose elder\r\nbrother Henry sacrificed all he dared in Kansas and returned to North Elba over\r\na year ago to recover from his wound at Black Jack and live again as a farmer\r\nand husband to our sister Ruth and thus will not die in Virginia with his\r\nbrothers. The others, sixteen of them—although Father thought there would be\r\nthirty or forty or even more—will join us when we ride south, or they have\r\nalready been sent there by the Old Man to reconnoiter and await our arrival:\r\nJohn Kagi, who even now is in Virginia, ascertaining the number and quality of\r\nthe forces that will oppose us; and John Cook, disguised as an itinerant\r\nschoolteacher, obtaining and fitting out for our rendez-vous the soon-to-be-\r\nfamous Kennedy farmhouse on the heights north of Harpers Ferry, the place\r\nwhere we will make our headquarters during the weeks leading up to our assault\r\non the armory and town below. Brothers John and Jason, with their families in\r\nOhio, will not join us in battle, Jason on principle and John, against his\r\nprinciples, out of fear.",
    " Brother Salmon, at Father’s orders and despite his loud\r\nprotestations, has been stationed here at the farm to care for Mary and our\r\nsisters and to manage the affairs of the family, which the Old Man knows will\r\nbecome exceedingly complex after the raid, regardless of its outcome.\r\nBut on the day of my arrival at the farm, no one is there to greet me; no one\r\nreaches out to embrace me and welcome me home. Shadows flash across the\r\nground at my feet, as the broken, silver-edged clouds pass over the house and\r\nbreak and merge and break again—the earth keeps spinning on its spine and\r\nrolling around the sun, whilst here on the ground all is still, fixed in time and\r\nplace like a lacquered insect impaled upon a pin: the lane off the roadway; the\r\nbarn and outbuildings; the house itself. And there, yonder in the center of the\r\nyard, is Father’s rock, head-high and the size of a room.",
    " The chunk of dark gray\r\ngranite sits settled upon the ground as if placed there for no other purpose than\r\nto mark the eventual gravesite of Father himself and of my brothers Watson and\r\nOliver, of the Thompson boys, William and Dauphin; and to memorialize the\r\nimpetuous John Kagi, the noble Aaron Stevens, who will take four shots in the\r\nbody before he falls, and John Cook, who will be captured in the Pennsylvania\r\nwoods a few miles north of Harpers Ferry and dragged back to Virginia to be\r\nhung alongside Father and the rest; of the quick-tempered boy from Maine\r\nCharlie Tidd, and Jeremiah Anderson, avenging himself upon his grandfather, a\r\nVirginia slaveholder, and Albert Hazlett, who followed the Old Man to victory in\r\nKansas and will follow him to the scaffold in Virginia; and of the stoical Edwin\r\nCoppoc of Ohio and his younger brother, Barclay, and the free Negro John\r\nCopeland, as intelligent and articulate as a Brown; and of the Canadian\r\nspiritualist Stewart Taylor, and Will Leeman, the youngest of the raiders in our\r\nband, a Maine boy who went to work at fourteen in a shoe factory and at\r\nseventeen came out to Kansas for no other reason than to fight alongside the\r\ngreat Osawatomie Brown; and of Osborn Anderson, the Negro printer who joined\r\nFather in Canada, and Frank Meriam of Massachusetts, and Lewis Leary, the\r\nmulatto man who said he was descended from the Lost Colonists of Roanoke Isle,\r\nand the tall, handsome Dangerfield Newby, an escaped slave whose abiding hope\r\nfor the raid was to free his wife and children, but who will die of a six-inch spike\r\nshot into his throat by a pro-slaver’s musket; and of Frederick Douglass’s man\r\nShields Green, whom we called Emperor, a man born a slave, who freed his body\r\nand gave it over to the cause, but never quite freed his mind. . . .",
    " There sits the\r\nhuge, rough Adirondack boulder, a chunk of the mountain Tahawus, ready to\r\nmemorialize the short lives and violent deaths of the men whom I will ride into\r\nbattle with and then betray. It will be their ghostly watchtower, the place where\r\nthey will gather together afterwards and wait in silence through the long years,\r\nas winter snows blow down from Canada and sweep across the Plains of\r\nAbraham and as spring rains wash and thaw the land and soften it for the\r\ngrasses and flowers of summer and as the autumn leaves catch and collect in\r\nlow, moldering piles. Great-Grandfather John Brown’s Yankee slate marker leans\r\nagainst the rock, brought north from Connecticut, as Father long intended, to\r\nremind all men and women of the unmarked graves of the old Revolutionary\r\nWar hero and of brother Fred, whose dates have been freshly cut into it and\r\nwhose body lies beneath Kansas soil, forever lost to us: both those accusatory\r\nsouls will linger with the others here as well, for it matters not where lie today\r\nthe bits of bone and the shreds of cloth they once wore: their spirits have all\r\nreturned to this one spot, this cold, gray altar, here to be stared and wondered at\r\nby casual passers-by, to be prayed over by those who would come out and pay\r\nhomage to John Brown and his brave men, and to haunt and chastize me for all\r\nthe remaining years of my life, even to today, this long, ongoing day of my\r\ninevitable return. It is here, before this stone altar, that I must make my final\r\nconfession and my sacrifice.\r\nCold stove, aprons drooped across chair-backs, muddy boots stacked in the rack\r\nby the back entry: I stand in the dead center of the room and cock my head like\r\na hunted animal listening for the hunter; no, more like the hunter poised for the\r\nsound of his prey.",
    " But I hear nothing, not even a mouse in the wall or a squirrel\r\nskittering across the cedar-shake roof. No brother or sister turns in sleep in a\r\nnarrow cot in the loft overhead; no one sighs and peers from the small, square\r\nwindow up there. There is not a breath, human or otherwise, to ripple the still,\r\nfunereal air of this house.\r\nPerhaps I have unknowingly arrived home on the Sabbath, the Lord’s one day\r\nof rest, when, after six days of tending to our puny needs, He commands us to\r\ntend His. Perhaps everyone has departed for the small white church in the\r\nsettlement below, there to pray for strength now and divine grace at the moment\r\nof death and salvation and eternal life thereafter.\r\nEverlasting life—what a horrid thought! Although sometimes I have believed\r\nthat it would not be a terrible thing to be killed eternally. To be slain again and\r\nagain, until I no longer feared death. Then life would be the illusion, and dying\r\nand being born again to die again the only reality: the world, which has no\r\nexperience anyhow at being me, would simply go on being itself. I might become\r\ngood, finally: a perfect man, like a Hindoo saint, with no stern, bearded God\r\nlording it over me, enticing me with guilt and shame and principles and duty,\r\nand making goodness an irresistible obligation, impossible to meet, and not\r\nsimply man’s natural condition.\r\nAh, but I was born and raised a Christian, not a Hindoo! I can only glimpse\r\nthese things but now and then and cannot sustain such a perverse, foreign view\r\nof life and death for longer than it takes to write it down here. Worse, I am a\r\nChristian without a God, a fallen man without a Saviour. I am a believer without\r\nbelief.",
    "\r\nI’m unable to say how long I have stood here in the house thinking these\r\nstrange thoughts, but the shadows have grown long, and the room has nearly\r\nfallen into darkness, when finally, for the first time since my arrival home, I hear\r\nthe sound of another living creature: the slow hoofbeats of a horse, then of\r\nseveral horses approaching the farm at a walk, and the sharp bark of a dog—\r\nfrom the high, thin sound of it, a collie dog—and the laughter and easy talk of\r\nhuman beings! From the window I see, coming through the dusk, my family:\r\nthere at the front is Father, white-bearded and looking ancient in the face,\r\nthough still as straight-gaited as ever; and my stepmother, Mary, and my sisters\r\nseated up in the wagon; and my younger brothers and brothers-in-law and\r\nsisters-in-law, and with them, afoot and on horseback and riding in a trap, half a\r\ndozen more, white people and Negroes both, our longtime northcountry\r\nneighbors and friends coming gaily along the lane from the settlement as if from\r\na holiday outing.\r\nSuddenly, the empty vessel has been filled, and out of invisibility and silence, I\r\nhave been made visible to myself, and audible! I call out to them, joyous and\r\ngrateful for the simple fact of their existence elsewhere than in my mind and\r\nmemory, and rush pell-mell from the house to the yard and greet them there.\r\nThese beautiful, utterly familiar faces and bodies are real, are tangible! And\r\nhere, at last, clasped to the bosom of family and friends, I am one with others\r\nagain! As when I was a child and my mother had not died yet. As when Father\r\nhad not begun to block out the sun and replace it with his own cold disk, as\r\nwhen he had not cast me in his permanent shadow. They all touch me, and they\r\neven embrace me, and they say how glad they are to have me with them again.\r\nThough nothing is forgotten, all is forgiven!",
    " Even Susan Epps is here amongst\r\nthem, and she has beside her, holding tightly to her skirt, a small boy—her son,\r\nLyman’s son, emblem of her love for him and his forgiveness of me, for that is\r\nhow she presents the little boy to me, saying simply, proudly, “I have a son to\r\nmake your acquaintance, Owen Brown,” and that is how I receive him, and he\r\nme.\r\nSister Ruth declares that she, too, will soon have a child to make my\r\nacquaintance, a nephew or niece, and there will be others coming along before\r\nlong, for here are Oliver and his pretty young bride, Miss Martha Brewster, who\r\nhave this very afternoon become husband and wife! A wedding, one I could have\r\nattended myself, Ruth tells me, had I arrived in time or had they known of the\r\nimminence of my return so as to have held off the wedding for a few hours. But\r\nno one knew when Owen would appear, except Father, she says, and nods\r\napprovingly at the Old Man, who kept insisting that Owen would get home in\r\ntime for Oliver’s and Lizzies wedding, and as usual Father was not altogether\r\nwrong, she adds, and not altogether right, and everyone laughs at that, for we\r\nare delighted when Ruth teases the Old Man, the only one of us who can do it\r\nand make him blush with pleasure from it and not scowl.\r\nMary, my dear stepmother, I first hold close to my face and then at arms’\r\nlength, so that I can peer into her large brown eyes and see my own face\r\nreflected back and know that, even though I can never love her as she wishes\r\nand Father asks, she nonetheless loves me as powerfully as any mother can love\r\nher natural son and feels no loss for herself or imbalance in the exchange, only\r\nsorrow for me.",
    " My brothers and brothers-in-law and my old friends from\r\nTimbuctoo and the village of North Elba, all in the shy way of northcountry\r\nfarmers, shake my hand and clap me on the shoulder and ask me to say by what\r\nroute, by what roads and ferries and canals, came I home all the way from I-o-\r\nway; and how were the other boys, asks Salmon, when I passed through Ohio;\r\nand their families, asks Watson, and our uncles and aunts and cousins in Ohio;\r\nand did I visit and pray over Grandfather Brown’s grave in Akron, asks sister\r\nAnnie, the sweetest and most pious of Father’s daughters and of Grandfather\r\nBrown’s granddaughters. And to all I say yes and yes and yes: I have done\r\neverything that you would have me do, been everywhere you wanted me to go,\r\nsaid what you wished to have said yourselves, and now here I am standing\r\namongst you, your beloved son, brother, uncle, dear friend, and I want nothing\r\nof life now but never again to leave this place and these people. I see the newly\r\nmarried and the recently familied and the several generations rising and all this\r\nbeautiful, high meadowland and forest that surrounds us, and I permit myself\r\nthe glimmering thought that someday soon I will ask to marry Susan Epps and\r\nraise her son and make for us a farm here on the Plains of Abraham. I will make\r\nof this joyful moment a starting point for a long, happy, and fruitful life, instead\r\nof making it the mocking, ironic end of a life that was short and bitter and\r\nbarren.\r\nWould that not be a wonderful way to end this story?",
    " With one wedding just\r\nfinished and another soon to come—the third son of John Brown to marry the\r\nNegro widow of his dearest friend, to raise together his friend’s, her late\r\nhusband’s, namesake into manhood here in the Adirondack wilderness, the three\r\nof them, one small family free of all the cruel symbolism of race and the ancient\r\ncurse of slavery, a white man and a Negro woman and child held dear by a\r\nfamily and community that see them and deal with them solely as family and\r\nfriends and fellow citizens?\r\nFantasy, delusion, dream! A guilty white man’s chimera, that’s all. It lasts but a\r\nsecond. It lasts until Father comes forward now and places his heavy hands onto\r\nmy shoulders, and I am suddenly ashamed of my hope and can no longer look at\r\nSusan or her son or at anyone else. Only at Father: at his cold eyes, gray as\r\ngranite. I feel him press his hands down with great force, as if he has settled a\r\nyoke upon my shoulders and wishes me to kneel under its weight. And so I do, I\r\nbend and kneel, and in Jesus’ name he prays over me, thanking the Almighty for\r\nbringing me safely home, so that I can keep and fulfill my covenant with the\r\nLord and can now go out from this blessed place and commence the great and\r\nterrible work that He hath ordained for us.\r\nAmen, he says; and Amen says everyone else; and Amen say I, too.\r\n2 2\r\nWe wake in darkness and long for light, and when the light comes, we wait for\r\ndarkness to return, so that we can descend the rickety ladder from our crowded,\r\nwindowless attic and warm our hands at the kitchen fire and walk about the\r\nyard awhile.",
    " We go out of the house either in pairs or alone, so as not to draw\r\nthe attention of some errant nighttime traveler unexpectedly making his late\r\nway past the old Kennedy farm, someone who from the road would surely note,\r\neven in darkness, the presence of a crowd often or more men milling about the\r\nstone-and-white-clapboard house and wonder why they were there. The house is\r\nsurrounded by woods, however, and is fairly remote, with the public road in\r\nfront leading only and indirectly to the country village of Boonesborough, so\r\nthat a pair of men or a man alone, if he remain silent, can walk back and forth\r\nbefore the house unseen for a spell, can stretch his cramped limbs and breathe\r\nthe cool, fresh air of outdoors for the first time in twenty-four hours, and from\r\nthe road no one not warned of a stranger’s presence would see him. Even if by\r\naccident the traveler did catch a glimpse of a stranger or two standing in the\r\nyard, he would think nothing amiss, for Dr. Kennedy’s family, now removed to\r\nBaltimore, has often rented its old, abandoned family farm to landless seasonal\r\nfarmers, which was how John Kagi, when he contracted to rent the place for us,\r\nrepresented Father and his several sons—a Mr. Isaac Smith and his boys, from up\r\nnear Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, looking for good Virginia farmland to buy\r\nand perhaps at the same time to graze and fatten a few head of livestock to\r\nbutcher and sell in the fall to the citizens and armory workers of Harpers Ferry.\r\nKagi, who seems almost to believe his lies himself, has a gift for storytelling.\r\nThe town of Harpers Ferry and the rifle and musket manufactories and the\r\nfederal arsenal are situated in a deep, narrow gorge three miles south of here, on\r\na spit of terraced, flat-rock land, where the Shenandoah cuts between two high,\r\nwooded ridges and empties into the Potomac.",
    " At first sight, it seems an unlikely\r\nplace to make and store an army’s weapons, vulnerable to attack and siege from\r\nthe high bluffs on both sides of both rivers. But Father has explained that none\r\nof our nation’s enemies could attack the town, so far from sea, without first\r\nhaving captured Washington, fifty miles downriver, or Richmond and Baltimore.\r\nThe last place from which the federal government would expect Harpers Ferry to\r\nbe attacked is by land, he says, smiling, and only our fellow Americans could\r\nmanage that. Which is, of course, precisely where and who we are: ensconced\r\nnorthwest of the town up here in the Kennedy farmhouse, fellow Americans\r\ncoming in under cover of darkness one by one from all over the continent—well-\r\narmed young men with anti-slavery principles in their minds and bloody murder\r\nin their hearts.\r\nWe have said our somber final goodbyes to our families and homes in the\r\nNorth and have joined the Old Man here—fifteen white men and five Negro,\r\nwhen we have all assembled—to wait out the days and weeks and, if necessary,\r\nmonths until he tells us finally that the moment we have been waiting for, some\r\nof us for a lifetime, has come. The plan, his meticulously detailed schedule and\r\nbreakdown of operations, he has rehearsed for us over and over again, night\r\nafter night, in the chilled, candlelit room above the one big room of the house,\r\nour prison, as we have come jokingly to call it. On the basement level, there is a\r\nkitchen, where sister Annie and Oliver’s new wife, Martha, have settled in to\r\ncook and launder for us—they arrived back in mid-July, after Father, having\r\ndetermined that our disguise as land speculators and provenders of meat\r\nrequired the presence of womenfolk, summoned them down from North Elba.",
    " A\r\nshort ways from the house is a locked shed, where we have stored our weapons,\r\nwhich we periodically clean and maintain to break the monotony of our\r\nconfinement-some two hundred Sharps rifles and that many more pistols and a\r\nthousand sharpened steel-tipped pikes, all paid for by Father’s secret supporters\r\nand shipped to Isaac Smith & Sons piecemeal over the summer months from\r\nOhio and Hartford by way of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in wooden cases\r\nmarked “Hardware and Castings.” John Kagi, who once taught school in the area\r\nand knows it well, has functioned as our main advance agent here and has\r\nfacilitated these delicate operations. Also, John Cook has been here for nearly a\r\nyear already, sent down from Iowa by Father as a spy, because of his intelligence\r\nand Yale education and his much-admired social skills, and he has managed\r\nwithout arousing suspicion to gain employment as a canal-lock tender and last\r\nspring even married a local girl, whom he had got with child, which naturally\r\ndid not particularly please Father, but it helped Cook settle into the daily life of\r\nthe town, and that has proved useful.\r\nWe ourselves have arrived in a trickle, a few at a time. First, on July 3, Father\r\nand I and our old Kansas cohort Jeremiah Anderson came in by wagon from\r\nNorth Elba, and then soon after came Oliver and Watson and the Thompson\r\nboys, William, who earlier wished to be in Kansas with us and his brother Henry\r\nbut never made it off the Thompson farm, and his younger brother Dauphin,\r\nonly twenty years old, by nature a sweet and gentle boy, but who over the years\r\nhas come practically to worship Father.",
    " From Maine comes Charlie Tidd and\r\nwith him Aaron Stevens, both hardened veterans of the Kansas campaign, and\r\nshortly after them, Albert Hazlett rides a wagon in, followed by the Canadian\r\nStewart Taylor, the spiritualist, who is convinced that he alone will die at\r\nHarpers Ferry and seems almost to welcome it, as if his death is a small price to\r\npay for the survival of the rest of us. A week later, the Coppoc brothers, Edwin\r\nand Barclay, will arrive at the farmhouse, lapsed Quakers who trained with us in\r\nIowa. Then, late in the summer, Willie Leeman will walk all the way in from\r\nMaine, and shortly after him come the first of the Negroes, Osborn Anderson and\r\nDangerfield Newby, which pleases Father immensely, for he has begun to grow\r\nfearful that his army will be made up only of white men. In the end, there will\r\nbe four more men to join us at the Kennedy farm: the Bostonian Francis Meriam,\r\nunstable and inspired to join us by his recent visit with the journalist Redpath to\r\nthe black republic of Haiti; and John Copeland, Lewis Leary, and Shields Green,\r\nthe last three of them Ohio Negroes, which, not counting our commander-in-\r\nchief, rounds out our number at twenty.\r\nBut do not fear, this number will be sufficient unto our present needs, Father\r\nhas declared. We have pared away from our side all those men who would\r\ndefeat us through their cowardice and faithlessness. We now have only the\r\nenemy to fight.",
    " July has turned into August and is moving rapidly towards\r\nautumn, and as each new recruit joins us, Father begins his narrative anew, an\r\nold jeremiad against slavery that lapses into fresh prophecy of its demise, as\r\nweekly he adjusts his plan for the taking of Harpers Ferry, so that it reflects the\r\nskills and personalities of the new arrivals, his increased belief in his recruits’\r\ncommitment to the raid, and his growing awareness that in the end there will be\r\nfar fewer of us than he anticipated. The arrival of Mr. Douglass will, of course,\r\nalter things considerably, even if he comes alone, but it’s mainly afterwards that\r\nhis presence will revise our circumstances and operations, Father points out,\r\nafter we have seized the town and the cry has gone out across the Virginia\r\ncountryside that Osawatomie Brown and Frederick Douglass have begun their\r\nlong-awaited war to liberate the slaves. That’s when our sharpened pikes, with\r\ntheir six-foot ash handles and eight-inch knife blades bolted to the top, will go\r\ninto action. Father believes that most of the slaves who join up with us will not\r\nbe much experienced in the use of firearms, but until they can be trained and\r\nproperly armed, these weapons will do them fine. Besides, the very sight of\r\nrazor-sharp spears in the hands of vengeful liberated Negroes will help terrorize\r\nthe slaveholders. Terror is one of our weapons, he says. Perhaps our strongest\r\nweapon. Until then, however, and for now, this is the plan.\r\nFrom our blanket rolls scattered over the rough plank floor, we prop our heads\r\nin our hands and listen to our commander-in-chief, and each of us sees himself\r\nplaying his role flawlessly, not missing a cue or a line, as if he were an actor in a\r\nperfectly executed play.",
    " Father sits on a stool in the center of the attic, and as\r\nusual, he first hectors and inspires us with his rhetoric and then runs through his\r\nplan yet again. He is the author of the play and its stage-manager and master of\r\ncostumes and scenery and all our properties, and he is the lead actor as well—\r\nalong with Mr. Douglass, of course, we mustn’t forget him, for without Frederick\r\nDouglass, no matter how successful the first act is played, the second and third\r\nwill surely fail. There may not even be a second or third. Everyone knows that.\r\nFather will reveal more about those acts later, he says, but for now we need be\r\nmindful only that it is overall a work, a performance, whose second and\r\ncontinuing acts will require not one hero but two.\r\nThe rest of us are important players, too, we know, but compared to the Old\r\nMan and Mr. Douglass, minor. Father insists that no, each one of us is as crucial\r\nto the success of this operation as every other: from top to bottom, we are a\r\nchain, and if one link breaks, the entire chain comes undone. But still, we know\r\nbetter. And so does he. Each of us twenty is replaceable, and until Mr. Douglass\r\narrives, this will be the Old Man’s show, and then it will belong to the two of\r\nthem. It will never belong to us. Meanwhile, however, we listen to the Old Man’s\r\ndirections and memorize our lines and positions, so that when at last\r\nOsawatomie Brown steps onto the stage and begins the action, we will be able to\r\nfollow his lead and efficiently prepare the way for the entry of the famous\r\nFrederick Douglass and his thousands of Negro actors, all of whom are as yet\r\nunrehearsed and have been cast as players only in our imaginations.\r\nEven so, the time to act is fast approaching, Father tells us.",
    " Already there have\r\nappeared numerous signs from the Lord—such as the sudden recent arrival of\r\nthe pikes from Chambersburg, where they had been oddly delayed for weeks,\r\ndespite Kagi’s best attempts to get them released and sent on to us. And soon\r\nfrom the Lord there will come additional signs, emblems and omens dressed as\r\nincidental events and information, to encourage us and make us the more eager\r\nto risk our lives in battle rather than continue with this suffocating waiting game\r\nat the farm on the Maryland Heights. For instance, Father will dispatch Cook\r\ndown along the Charles Town Turnpike to determine the numbers and\r\ndisposition of the slaves there, his only attempt to reconnoiter the region beyond\r\nthe town of Harpers Ferry itself, and Cook will return aflame with news that the\r\nmoon is right for insurrection, for it is nearly a dog-tooth moon, the type that\r\nmakes Africans particularly discontented, he has learned. This, too, is a sign\r\nfrom the Lord, Father tells us. Cook has also been told of a young male slave at a\r\nfarm nearby who just yesterday hung himself because his owner sold the man’s\r\nwife down South. A shipment of spears suddenly released, a dog-tooth moon,\r\nand a hanging man: on the strength of these and other similarly propitious\r\nportents, Father has sent sister Annie and Martha back home to North Elba. We\r\nare now awaiting only the arrival of Mr. Douglass, who we hope will bring with\r\nhim a phalanx of well-armed Negro fighters from the North, although Father\r\nwarns us that lately letters from his black cohorts back there are suggesting\r\notherwise.\r\nFinally, one night Father climbs up to our attic with his lamp in one hand and\r\na fat packet of papers and maps in the other, and taking his customary seat at\r\nthe center of the group, he spreads the contents of his packet at his feet.",
    " As he\r\nbegins to speak, he raises one of the maps from the pile—we see at once that it is\r\nthe now-familiar drawing of the streets and buildings of Harpers Ferry, made by\r\nCook—and, as usual, he shows it to us and allows it to be passed amongst us, so\r\nthat, while Father sets out the plan, each man can better visualize what he is to\r\ndo and where he shall stand when he does it. This time, however, when he has\r\ngone through, once again, step by step, the taking of Harpers Ferry, he retrieves\r\nand sets aside Cook’s map and is silent and looks somberly at his clasped hands,\r\nas if in prayer. After a long moment, without looking up, he abruptly declares\r\nthat tonight he has decided to reveal to us that we will not be conducting the\r\nsort of raid that most of us still believe we have come here for. This is not to be\r\nmerely a larger, more dangerous and dramatic, slave-running expedition than\r\nany of us has ever undertaken before. There is instead a much larger task before\r\nus, a greater thing than we have yet dared imagine.\r\nKagi has long known of this grand, about-to-be-revealed scheme, as have I, of\r\ncourse, and a few of the others, Cook, Stevens, and Anderson, and we have\r\nargued privately amongst ourselves as to its feasibility and have agreed, after\r\nmuch disputation, that it can be done and must be attempted; but my brothers\r\nWatson and Oliver have not heard it before, nor my brothers-in-law Will and\r\nDauphin Thompson, nor has Father until now trusted any of the recent arrivals\r\nwith this vision, for it is truly a vision and not so much a plan, and to see it as he\r\ndoes, we must first for a long time not have seen or heard much else. Our long\r\nconfinement together and our isolation from the world outside have finally made\r\nus all visionaries, capable at last of seeing what Father sees and of believing his\r\nwords as if they were true prophecy.",
    "\r\nHere, men, I want you to examine these maps, he says, and he picks up and\r\nflaps at us a set of cambric-cloth squares onto which he has pasted the states of\r\nVirginia, Maryland, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and the Carolinas\r\n—eight squares, and one state to a square. In the margin of each map, he has\r\nwritten numerals: 491,000, for the number of slaves in Virginia, he explains,\r\n87,000 in Maryland, and so on, which comes to a total of 1,996,366 slaves, he\r\npronounces, looking up at us. But he does not see us, his twenty followers,\r\nunshaven, unwashed, gaunt, and sober-faced, all of us young men and a few of\r\nus mere boys: instead, his gray eyes gleam with excitement at the sight of a\r\nspreading black wave of mutinous slaves, nearly two million strong, as all across\r\nthe South they flee their cabins and shops and barns and rise from the cotton\r\nand tobacco and sugarcane fields and take up pitchforks, axes, machetes, and the\r\nthousands of Sharps rifles that will come flowing down the Alleghenies from the\r\nNorth; he sees them, first hundreds, then thousands, and finally hundreds of\r\nthousands of black men, women, and children, flowing down the country roads\r\nand highways, meeting in town squares and on city streets and merging into the\r\nlargest army ever seen in this land, an army with but one purpose, and that is to\r\ntake back from the slaveholders what for a quarter of a millennium has been\r\nstolen from them—their freedom, their American birthrights, their very lives.\r\nThis raid will establish no Underground Railroad operation, he tells us, for\r\nregardless of scale, it is no mere slave raid. This will be an act of an entirely\r\ndifferent order. Yes, after we have taken Harpers Ferry, we will make our\r\nappointed rendezvous with Mr.",
    " Douglass in the Allegheny foothills west of here,\r\nas planned, but then we will not, as some of us believed, hole up in small forts\r\nand siphon escaped slaves into the North. Instead, we shall divide our forces into\r\ntwo portions, the Defenders, under Mr. Douglass’s command, and the Liberators,\r\nunder Father’s, and whilst the Defenders protect and hurry into the North those\r\nwomen, children, elderly, and infirm slaves who wish to resettle there, the\r\nLiberators will commence to march rapidly southward along the densely wooded\r\nnorth-south mountain passes, making lightning-like strikes against the\r\nplantations on the plains lower down, seizing armories and arsenals and supplies\r\nas they go, building a cavalry, like Toussaint L’Ouverture, and even seizing\r\nartillery, like the Maroons of Jamaica, destroying railroads and fortifications.\r\nWhen the Shenandoah Valley goes, the plantations along the James River will\r\nquickly fall, and then the Tidewater tobacco farms, and when Virginia goes, the\r\nrest of the Southern states will nearly conquer themselves, there being down\r\nthere, as in Haiti and Jamaica, such a disproportionate number of Negroes to\r\nwhites. And there will be thousands of non-slaveholding whites, too, God-\r\nfearing, decent Southerners, who will come running to our side, once they\r\nunderstand that our true intentions are not to slay white men and women in\r\ntheir beds or to overthrow their state or federal government or to dissolve the\r\nUnion, but merely to end American slavery. To end it now, here, in these years.\r\nLook, look! he says, excitedly showing us the map of Alabama, where with X’she\r\nhas marked, county by county, the heaviest concentrations of slaves.",
    " When we\r\nemerge from the Tennessee hills here in Augusta County, the slaves will rise up\r\nspontaneously in adjacent Montgomery County, and in a week or perhaps two,\r\nwhen the news has arrived there, the same will occur in Macon and Russell\r\nCounties, and the flames of rebellion will leap like a wildfire from one district to\r\nthe next, straight across into Georgia, whence the fire will roar all the way east\r\nto the Sea Isles, causing it to curl back north into the Carolinas, until we have\r\nignited a great, encircling conflagration, which cannot be extinguished until it\r\nhas burnt the ancient sin and scourge of slavery entirely away, from one end of\r\nthe South to the other, from Maryland to Louisiana, until at last nothing remains\r\nof the Slavocracy but a smoldering pile of char!\r\nThe Old Man’s peroration ends and is met with soft silence. At first, Kagi,\r\nCook, Stevens, and Anderson look slowly around the dim, shadowy room, as if\r\nsearching the faces of the others for a sign that their collective silence indicates\r\ncollective skepticism, which was Kagi’s early reaction to Father’s vision, or\r\ndismay, Cook’s and Stevens’s first response, or simple awe, Anderson’s. I myself\r\nlook to my brothers’ eyes, Watson and Oliver, seeking there a clarifying version\r\nof my own thoughts and feelings, for in my earlier disputations with Kagi, Cook,\r\nand Stevens, I defended the logic of Father’s grand plan with no other desire\r\nthan to defeat their objections to it, my old role, and in winning them over have\r\nnot made my own private position strong to myself or even clear. But it is too\r\nlate. Watson and Oliver and the Thompsons, my brothers and brothers-in-law, all\r\nof the men, wear on their faces a single expression, the expression worn also by\r\nKagi, Cook, Stevens, and Anderson, and no doubt by me, too: it is the hungry\r\nlook of a follower, of a true believer.",
    " There is no Thomas the Doubter in this\r\nroom, no sober skeptic, no ironist, no dark materialist. We have all been\r\nconfined here in this isolated place for too many weeks and months to have any\r\nmentality left that is not a piece of a single mind, and that mind is shaped and\r\nfilled by Father alone.\r\nBut, yes, much of what you have expected will be met, he continues, calmer\r\nnow, comforted by our silence. He again holds out Cook’s large, detailed map of\r\nthe streets and buildings of Harpers Ferry and says that we shall indeed, as we\r\nhave intended all along, soon attack and seize the town. That has not changed. It\r\nwill be our first formally declared act of war against the slaveholders, the first\r\nact of our mighty drama. And when we have seized the town, we shall, as\r\nplanned, take control of the arms stored in three buildings there—the\r\ngovernment armory, where the muskets are made, the Hall rifle works, and the\r\narsenal. As we all know, there are no federal troops presently posted in the town\r\nand only a few private guards protecting these stores of weapons and munitions,\r\nso we will not be much opposed, and if we strike quickly and under cover of\r\nnight, it will be done before we are even noticed by the townspeople. We shall\r\nnevertheless take hostages and hold them, probably in the armory yard, to\r\nprotect us against the local militias, should they be roused, whilst we await the\r\nfirst reinforcing arrival of mutinous slaves from the surrounding countryside,\r\nand then, in a matter of hours, we shall have flown back up into the mountain\r\nfastness south and west of the town, whence shall come our Republic’s salvation.\r\nShortly after nightfall on a Sabbath, it will begin with a fervent prayer offered\r\nup to God, that we may be assisted by Him in the total, final liberation of all the\r\nslaves on this continent.",
    " We shall not ask the Lord to spare or even to protect our\r\nown lives in this venture: our lives have been pledged strictly to our duty; that is\r\nall. We must not ask the Lord to release us of our duty. Then, with everyone\r\ngathered in the room below, so that we may be mentally clear as to our legal\r\nrights and obligations and our principles, Aaron Stevens, who has the most\r\nimpressive voice of us all, will read aloud Father’s Provisional Constitution and\r\nOrdinances for the People of the United States, which so nobly begins: Whereas\r\nslavery is a most barbarous, unprovoked, and unjustifiable war of one portion of its\r\ncitizens upon another portion in utter disregard and violation of those eternal and self-\r\nevident truths set forth in our Declaration of Independence: therefore, we, citizens of\r\nthe United States, and the oppressed people who, by a recent decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt, are declared to have no rights which the white man is bound to respect,\r\ntogether with all other people degraded by the laws thereof, do, for the time being,\r\nordain and establish for ourselves the following Provisional Constitution and\r\nOrdinances. He will read all forty-five articles, ending thusly, with the carefully\r\nworded reassurance that The foregoing articles shall not be construed so as in any\r\nway to encourage the overthrow of any State government, or of the general\r\ngovernment of the United States, and look to no dissolution of the\r\nUnion, but simply to amendment and repeal. And our flag shall be the same that\r\nour fathers fought under in the Revolution.\r\nFollowing this somber recitation, our commander-in-chief will administer\r\nanew to us as a group the same oath of secrecy that, individually, upon our first\r\narrival at the farm, each of us has already been sworn to. Father then will say\r\nsimply, “Men, get on your arms. We now proceed to the Ferry.",
    "”\r\nI am to stay behind with Francis Meriam and Barclay Coppoc, the two men\r\nFather and I have come to view as the weakest links in our chain, the one\r\nbecause of his physical frailty and tendency to hysteria, the other because of his\r\nyouth and his residual Quaker timidity. I would prefer to be at the front with\r\nFather and the others, but I know better than to object to this assignment, for no\r\none else in the group can be trusted with it, he says, and besides, it places me in\r\na position of authority as second-in-command and at Father’s flank, so that if\r\nsomething goes dreadfully wrong, my duty will be to rescue them. My\r\nimmediate charge, however, is to transfer all the arms from the house and\r\nstorage shed, except for those taken by the advance party, to a small, unused\r\nschoolhouse situated in the woods overlooking the Potomac and directly across\r\nthe river from Harpers Ferry, there to await the first arrival of liberated slaves,\r\nto arm them and lead them into the mountains, where a few days later we will\r\nrendez-vous with Father and the others. On his map of Virginia, Father shows us\r\nour Allegheny meeting place in Frederick County, which he himself scouted\r\nyears ago, while on a surveying expedition of lands owned by Oberlin College.\r\nMr. Douglass should have joined us by then, Father assures us, and will take\r\noverall command of my unit. I am to remain as captain of the new recruits,\r\nhowever, and as executive officer of the operation, until Father himself has\r\njoined us. After that, I am to ride at Father’s side with the Liberators. I have also\r\nbeen charged with the obligation to remove or destroy any incriminating\r\nevidence that we might have left here at the farmhouse, such as letters, maps,\r\njournals, and other personal effects.\r\nWe have in our possession two wagons, one for my use and the other for\r\nFather’s advance party.",
    " It must be on a night with no moon shining, no stars, a\r\nnight overcast and drear, and when Father’s men have loaded their wagon with\r\nthe half a hundred pikes and twenty rifles they require for the taking of Harpers\r\nFerry, immediately and without ceremony, at a simple command from Father,\r\nthey will set off down the public road, Father perched on the wagon seat with\r\nhis head uncharacteristically bent forward, stooped as if in deep thought or\r\nprayer, and our old North Elba farmhorse, the bay Morgan mare, between the\r\nshafts, and the sixteen men marching silently in the cold drizzle alongside the\r\nwagon and behind. I will stand by the door of the house with Meriam and young\r\nBarclay Coppoc and watch them disappear into the darkness as if being\r\nswallowed by it. I do not know yet what I will feel when that moment comes,\r\nbut it will not be fear or dread. It is too late for that.\r\nAfter a few moments, when we can no longer hear the tramp of their boots on\r\nthe wet ground or the creak and chop of their wagon and horse, my two men\r\nand I will turn quickly to our tasks—Meriam and Coppoc to load our wagon with\r\nthe remaining weapons from the shed, whilst I gather all our scattered papers\r\nfrom the house. By candlelight, I will prowl carefully through the entire house,\r\nfrom basement kitchen to our attic hideout, collecting every shred of paper I can\r\nfind and stuffing all of it loosely into a cloth valise. To my slight surprise, I will\r\nbe obliged to fill the bag several times over, emptying it each time in the\r\nbasement next to the woodstove on the flagstone floor of the kitchen. Soon I will\r\nhave made a large, disordered pile, at first glance much of it rubbish, which I\r\nplan to separate from the rest and burn.",
    " But when I commence to sort the\r\npapers, I will discover with a little shock that most of the remaining papers, a\r\nwhole heap of them, are Father’s, and amongst them are dozens of letters, many\r\nfrom family members in North Elba and Ohio, and numerous others, only\r\nslightly coded, written by his secret Northern supporters, Dr. Howe, Gerrit\r\nSmith, Franklin Sanborn, and so on, and even several letters from Frederick\r\nDouglass, and receipts for Father’s purchases of arms back in Iowa and Ohio and\r\nfor the pikes in Hartford, Connecticut, and here are all of Father’s maps, the very\r\nmaps with which he showed us his grand plan, and Cook’s drawing of Harpers\r\nFerry, and Father’s pocket notebooks, where he has listed, county by county, as\r\non his maps, slave population figures taken from the 1850 national census, and\r\nthe names of many towns and cities of the South and their marching distance\r\nfrom one another, such as Montgomery to Memphis, 3 da., and Charleston to\r\nSavannah, 2 1/2 da. I have known this would happen, for I have seen most of\r\nthese papers, maps, and notebooks lying carelessly about for weeks, as if, having\r\nshown them to us, Father no longer wished to order or hide them, and I have felt\r\na twinge of fear that, in the rush of last-minute preparations, he would neglect to\r\ntake them up. But I would not reflect upon it until later, until after Father and I\r\nhad ridden up for our final, secret meeting with Mr. Douglass in Chambersburg.\r\nWhile I clear the house and my men stack the arms into our wagon, Father and\r\nhis men will be nearing the covered bridge that crosses the Potomac from\r\nMaryland into the state of Virginia and the town of Harpers Ferry. This is how it\r\nwill go. Around nine o’clock, the drizzle shifts over to a straight rain.",
    " At ten-\r\nthirty, they reach the Maryland Heights, a steep, wooded thousand-foot-high cliff\r\nabove the cut of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge. Although from up here it\r\nis too dark to make out the shapes of the brick-front buildings and cobbled\r\nstreets below, the men can see through the rain a few dim, last lights from the\r\nslumbering town. Passing by the abandoned log schoolhouse, where I am to\r\nstore our weapons and later arm the escaping slaves, Father and his men descend\r\non the narrow, winding lane to the grassy riverbank and march for a while\r\nalongside the wide, swift-flowing, steel-colored river to the covered bridge,\r\nwhich crosses to Harpers Ferry a short ways upstream from the place where the\r\neast-running Potomac River is joined from the south by the Shendandoah. Well\r\nin sight of the bridge now, its wide, black entrance beckoning like the mouth of\r\na gigantic serpent, they leave the road and cross the C & O Canal at lock 23 and\r\nmake their way in the cold rain along the tow path to the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nRailroad tracks running in from the east. Here the tracks turn, cross the canal,\r\nand pass through the covered bridge alongside the narrow roadway, passing over\r\nthe wide, gray river in pitch darkness to the station and loading platforms in the\r\ntown center, where they turn again and lead out of town on the further side of\r\nthe Potomac into western Virginia and on to Ohio.\r\nFather and his men are well down in the gorge now, as if they have entered\r\nthe den of the monstrous snake. Behind them and before them on their left, like\r\nthick, black curtains hanging from the blacker sky, loom high walls, where\r\nclusters of scrub oak and thickets of thorn bushes cling to wet, rocky\r\nescarpments all the way to the tops, and tall, windblown chestnut and walnut\r\ntrees rise from the bluffs above.",
    " There can be no return now: Father and his men\r\nhave reached the bridge over the Potomac and must enter it and go on, straight\r\ninto the town at the further end. Father halts the wagon at the entrance for a\r\nmoment and stations Watson and Stewart Taylor as a rear guard on the\r\nMaryland side. Then, at the Old Man’s command, Kagi and Stevens march\r\nstraight into the mouth of the bridge. Fifty yards back, Father follows in the\r\nrumbling wagon, and the rest of the men, rifles at the ready and cartridge boxes\r\nclipped to the outside of their clothing for quick access, march wordlessly along\r\nbehind, walking stiffly on the loose planks, as if on ice, and taking shallow, tight\r\nbreaths, as if afraid to fill their chests with the blackness that surrounds them.\r\nA few moments later, Kagi and Stevens emerge from the long throat of the\r\nbridge. They are the first of the raiders to enter the town, and as soon as they\r\nhave set their boots onto the rain-slicked cobbles of Potomac Street, a watchman\r\nhears their step and calls, Who goes there! Kagi answers, Hallo, Billy Williams!\r\nIt’s a friend! The watchman draws close to the two and lifts his lantern and says,\r\nOh, it’s Mister Kagi who’s out so late, and they instantly throw down on him and\r\ntake him prisoner and douse his lamp.\r\nThe raid has begun. Osawatomie Brown and his men are inside Harpers Ferry\r\nand have taken their first hostage. The raiders are able to breathe and walk\r\nnormally now, and they move rapidly and efficiently from one place and\r\nsituation to the next, exactly as planned and rehearsed. Turning right on\r\nPotomac Street at the B & O train depot, they pass the deserted porch and\r\ndarkened windows of the Wager Hotel, where the last guests have finally gone\r\nupstairs to their rooms, and head straight towards the armory, a long double row\r\nof brick buildings situated between the railroad siding and the canal.",
    " On the left,\r\nadjacent to the gate of the armory grounds, there is a square brick building, a\r\nsingle-storey, two-room structure that serves as a fire-engine house for the town\r\nand a guardhouse for the armory. When Father has drawn the wagon close to the\r\niron gate, the armory watchman, whose name is Daniel Whelan, cracks open the\r\ntimbered door of the firehouse, pauses, squints into the darkness, and then\r\nreluctantly steps outside into the rain. In a sleepy voice, he says, That you,\r\nWilliams?\r\nOpen the gate, Mister Whelan, Father says.\r\nYou’re not Williams, says the watchman, more confused than frightened. At\r\nonce, Oliver and Newby step forward with their rifles leveled and take him\r\nprisoner. Aaron Stevens grabs the crowbar from the wagon bed and twists it into\r\nthe chain holding the gate. When the lock snaps, he and Kagi swing open the\r\ngate, and Father drives the wagon straight into the yard. The other men,\r\nincluding the two captured watchmen, follow at gunpoint, and Kagi swings the\r\ngate closed again.\r\nNow Father climbs down from the wagon and, turning to his dumbfounded\r\nprisoners, declares that he has come here from Kansas, for this is a slave state,\r\nand he has come to free all its Negro slaves.\r\nWilliams and Whelan look wide-eyed in disbelief at the old man. The rain\r\ndrips from the tattered brim of his hat and from his white beard. Barely hearing\r\nhis words, they stare at him, this bony, sharp-eyed old fellow in the frock coat,\r\nwho, except for his rifle and the two pistols at his waist, resembles more a poor,\r\nhardscrabble farmer from the hills than a Yankee liberator of slaves, and they\r\nlook around at the small, shabbily dressed, heavily armed group of white and\r\nNegro young men who stand near him, and finally at each other, and say\r\nnothing. What is happening here? For Williams and Whelan, this is a strange,\r\nwaking dream, a shared hallucination.",
    "\r\nI have taken possession of the United States armory, the old man calmly\r\ncontinues. And if the citizens of the town interfere with me and my men, we\r\nmust burn the town and have blood.\r\nFather now proceeds to dispatch his men so as to take control of the remaining\r\narms supplies and defenses of the town. Under guard by Dauphin Thompson and\r\nLewis Leary, the two hostages are shut into the firehouse, while Oliver and Will\r\nThompson are sent three blocks south on Shenandoah Street to take command of\r\nthe bridge that crosses the Shenandoah River into town. The tollbooth proves to\r\nbe empty and the bridge unguarded. Hazlett and Edwin Coppoc take over the\r\narsenal, also unguarded, just off the main square and in sight of the hotel, where\r\nthey will wait for further orders and a wagon to empty it. Stevens, Kagi, and\r\nCopeland are ordered to the rifle factory, which is located a short ways further\r\ndown Shenandoah Street at Lower Hall’s Island, a long, narrow rise of land in\r\nthe Shendandoah River that is separated from the shore by a canal. Once more, a\r\nsingle watchman is surprised by the raiders and, when captured, is marched by\r\nStevens back to the firehouse, leaving Kagi and Copeland behind to hold the rifle\r\nworks. On his return to the firehouse, Stevens comes upon three half-drunk,\r\nunarmed young men, carousers straggling home late from the Wager Hotel, and\r\nhe swiftly puts them under his gun and brings them in with the watchman.\r\nIt is not yet midnight, and both bridges into town, the armory, the arsenal, and\r\nthe rifle factory have been brought under the control of the raiders. Six men\r\nhave been taken hostage and locked into the firehouse. Unknown to the rest of\r\nits citizens, unknown to the world, Harpers Ferry, Virginia, belongs to\r\nOsawatomie Brown. Around this time, the rain lets up, and the clouds slowly\r\npull away and open the starry sky to view.",
    " Soon the dog-tooth moon breaks the\r\ndark horizon above the Maryland Heights north of town, where, just before one\r\nA.M., as Father expected, a fourth watchman, Patrick Higgins, comes down the\r\nmoonlit footpath from his home in Sandy Hook to relieve Williams at the\r\nMaryland side of the Potomac bridge. As he enters the covered bridge, Watson\r\nand Stewart Taylor, Father’s rear guard, step from the shadows and capture the\r\nman. In silence, dutifully following the plan, they direct their prisoner to the\r\nbridge and commence marching him over to the firehouse, when suddenly\r\nHiggins turns and swats Watson on the forehead and races ahead of them into\r\nthe darkness. Before Watson can stay his hand, Taylor raises his rifle and fires,\r\nhis bullet slightly grazing the forehead of the escaping man, who is able\r\nnonetheless to get safely to the end of the bridge and into the Wager Hotel,\r\nwhere he is the first to raise the alarm, although he cannot say who has shot at\r\nhim or why.\r\nThis is an eventuality that Father has anticipated, a part of his overall plan,\r\nand so long as it happens after the bridges and the arms stores have been\r\ncaptured and hostages have been taken, it does not much concern him that\r\nsometime in the night a shot or two will be fired, alerting the citizens that a\r\nviolent action is under way. By daylight, they will know of it, anyhow, and will\r\nbe told by him then of its purpose, and soon the whole country will begin to\r\napprehend its scale. After all, this raid is meant to be a public act, not a private\r\none, he has reminded us, and if our aims are to be met, we must actually invite a\r\ncertain hue-and-cry and, so long as we are in control of events and not they us,\r\nwelcome it. Still, the echoing sound of the first shot shocks the men, and\r\nWatson’s and Taylor’s breathless report that their prisoner has escaped into the\r\nhotel frightens them.",
    " Father, however, is calm as ice.\r\nAt this moment, he is mainly concerned with Aaron Stevens’s mission into the\r\ncountryside. He has sent Stevens with Tidd and Cook and three of the Negro\r\nmen, Anderson, Leary, and Green, five miles west of Harpers Ferry to Halltown,\r\nwhere resides the wealthy planter Colonel Lewis Washington, a man who is a\r\ndirect descendant of General George Washington and, for that, something of a\r\nlocal celebrity and politician, an aide to Virginia’s Governor Wise. Further, he is\r\nknown to have inherited from his incomparable ancestor an elaborately\r\nengraved pistol presented to the General after the Revolution by the Marquis de\r\nLafayette and a ceremonial sword given him by King Frederick the Great of\r\nPrussia. The Old Man wants Colonel Lewis Washington as a hostage, and he\r\nwants to free the Colonel’s half-dozen slaves, but most of all, to help place his\r\nown acts into their proper context, he wants General George Washington’s pistol\r\nand his sword.\r\nWith a rail pulled from the fence by the meadow in front of the house, Stevens\r\nand his men batter down the Colonel’s door and roust him and his terrified\r\nfamily from their beds. When the Colonel has dressed and has delivered over to\r\nthe raiders his ancestor’s famous weapons, Stevens formally places him under\r\narrest and, leaving the man’s wife and young children behind, seats him next to\r\nTidd in a two-horse carriage appropriated from the barn. Behind them,\r\nAnderson, Leary, and Green have hitched the Colonel’s four remaining horses to\r\na farm wagon and have placed into it three liberated slaves, two men and a\r\nyoung woman—all they could find in the house and barn, or maybe they’re the\r\nonly Negroes on the place not too frightened to show themselves, Anderson\r\nexplains to Stevens, for these poor people can’t know for sure yet that we are\r\nwho we say we are.",
    " Stevens agrees, and they start back along the Charles Town\r\nTurnpike towards Harpers Ferry.\r\nA mile west of Bolivar Heights, still following Father’s orders, they draw the\r\nwagons up before a large farm owned by John Allstadt, after Colonel\r\nWashington the wealthiest planter in the region and, like him, a slaveholder—\r\nthe owner, in fact, of the young woman who was sold off into the Deep South\r\nand her young husband who a week ago hung himself because of it. A second\r\ntime, Stevens and his men break down a front door and enter a stranger’s home\r\nunopposed. They quickly make hostages of the man of the house, Mr. Allstadt,\r\nand his eighteen-year-old son, and unceremoniously liberate Allstadt’s four\r\nremaining slaves, who are added to the group in the farm wagon. As instructed,\r\nStevens and the other raiders are scrupulously polite to their prisoners and to the\r\nwomen and children, just as they were at Colonel Washington’s, and they try not\r\nto frighten them overmuch and take pains to cause no unnecessary damage to\r\nthe house or personal property, other than that of converting the slaves into free\r\nmen and women. They state clearly to the whites their sole reason for breaking\r\ninto their homes in the middle of the night and making prisoners of the\r\nhusbands and sons—which is strictly to end slavery. If we are not opposed,\r\nStevens says, no blood will be spilt. The husbands and sons, like the wagons and\r\nhorses, will eventually be returned to them, but their slaves are no longer owned\r\nby them, he says. The slaves of Virginia are owned henceforth by themselves and\r\ncannot be returned to any man.\r\nIn the meantime, back at Harpers Ferry, at 1:25 A.M.",
    ", precisely as scheduled,\r\nthe Baltimore-bound B & O passenger train rolls in, and when it has hissed to a\r\nnoisy stop at the station, the night clerk from the hotel next door skitters low\r\nfrom the door of the railroad station, and before the conductor can step down\r\nfrom the train to the platform, the man has leapt aboard, bearing the startling\r\nnews that gunmen are out on the Potomac bridge and have shot a watchman,\r\nwho lies bleeding inside the hotel! Worse, the other three town watchmen are\r\nnowhere about and may even have been murdered! And here’s something else:\r\nwhen the clerk slipped unseen into the station by a rear window adjacent to the\r\nhotel, he tried to telegraph the stationmaster in Charles Town and discovered\r\nthat the wires had been cut. There is something very strange, something\r\ndangerous, happening, and until now, with no idea of how many gunmen might\r\nbe out there or where they may be hiding, no one but the night clerk has dared\r\nto leave the hotel or been able to raise a general alarm.\r\nThe conductor, A. J. Phelps, takes immediate charge and directs the engineer\r\nand the baggagemaster, who carries a pistol, to step from the train and\r\ninvestigate the bridge, for it may have been sabotaged. Who knows but what\r\nthese gunmen are train robbers and have blocked the bridge somehow? If the\r\ntracks appear clear, he says, they straightway will pass across the river and, at\r\nthe station in Monococy in Maryland, will telegraph the news of these startling\r\nevents over to Charles Town, the county seat, where there is a federal marshal’s\r\noffice and a regiment of town militia available for help.",
    "\r\nSleepy passengers peer out their windows, wondering why the delay, as the\r\nengineer and the baggagemaster, his pistol at the ready, walk slowly along the\r\nstation platform, step down to the railbed, and crunch over the cinders and\r\ngravel towards the dark mouth of the covered bridge. When the pair are about\r\nfifteen feet from the entrance, Watson speaks to them from the darkness ahead.\r\nDrop your pistol, sir, and both of you walk slowly towards us. Keep your hands\r\nin full view. You’re under a hundred guns, gentlemen, and are now our\r\nprisoners. You won’t be harmed, if you do as we say.\r\nThe baggagemaster lets his pistol fall to the railbed, and the two men, as\r\ninstructed, extend their hands as if ready to be manacled and walk forward.\r\nMeanwhile, behind them, up on the platform, a Negro man named Hayward\r\nShepherd, a freedman employed at the station as the night baggageman, has\r\nstepped from the office to the platform to see what is going on, and Phelps, the\r\nconductor—too far from the bridge for him or the clerk or anyone on the train to\r\nsee in the darkness that the engineer and the baggagemaster have been all but\r\ntaken prisoner—orders him to go and assist them in their investigation.\r\nShepherd jumps to the ground and hurries to join the two, who have\r\ndisappeared inside the bridge. When he, too, has neared the entrance and is now\r\nbeyond earshot of the men on the platform, he hears a calm, low voice from the\r\ndarkness, Watson Brown’s, ordering him to stop and listen. Shepherd, a middle-\r\naged bachelor affectionately called “Uncle Hay” by the white citizens of the\r\ntown, stops and listens. In a conversational tone, Watson tells him what Father\r\nhas instructed all of us to say to the Virginia freedmen. We have come from\r\nKansas to free the slaves. You may join us in this enterprise or not.",
    " But if you\r\nrefuse to join us, we will treat with you as with any white man who refuses to\r\njoin us. We will be forced to consider you our enemy.\r\nFor a second, Shepherd hesitates, as if not quite getting Watson’s meaning, and\r\nthen abruptly he turns and runs. Watson—or perhaps it is Stewart Taylor, or\r\nmaybe some other raider, standing in the shadows of the storefronts nearby; any\r\none of us could have done it—fires his rifle, and Shepherd falls, mortally\r\nwounded by a single bullet in the spine, running through to the chest. With\r\neveryone watching him and no one daring to move to help—not Watson or\r\nStewart inside the covered bridge, not their two prisoners, not the several raiders\r\nhiding in the shadows along the street or Father standing unseen at the gate of\r\nthe armory, not the men up on the platform by the station or the passengers\r\nstaring in horror from the windows of the train: no one who sees it can make\r\nhimself come forward to help the fallen man—as Shepherd lifts his bloody chest\r\nfrom the cinders and with his arms slowly drags his numbed, dying body away\r\nfrom the bridge towards the station. After what seems like a long while, he\r\nsucceeds in getting to a protected place below the platform that is close enough\r\nfor Phelps and the hotel clerk safely to reach down and draw him up to it, where\r\nthey quickly pull his body inside the station as if he were already a dead man.\r\nPrepare yourselves for sad ironies, Father forewarned us, often enough for us\r\nto have expected it. But it has come nonetheless as a dismaying shock. Men, the\r\ncruel perversity of slavery will snap back betimes and will try to bite us in our\r\nface, he told us. We have to be hard, hard. This surely is what he meant: that in\r\nthe liberation of the slaves, the first to die may well be neither a white man nor\r\na slave, but a free Negro.",
    "\r\nThis sad event has the immediate good effect, however, of closing down the\r\ntrain and trapping its passengers inside it, with Conductor Phelps and the hotel\r\nclerk retreating to the station, and the guests, those few wakened by this, the\r\nsecond gunshot of the night, holing up inside the hotel. For the time being, the\r\ntown is still ours. A little after four A.M., Aaron Stevens’s party comes clattering\r\ndown Potomac Street, the trap driven by Tidd, with Colonel Washington and Mr.\r\nAllstadt and his son in it, and the farm wagon driven by Cook, with the seven\r\nliberated slaves huddled in back. Stevens, who carries General Washington’s\r\npistol and sword wrapped in a blanket, and the other raiders, Anderson, Leary,\r\nand Green, are on horseback, their mounts taken from Allstadt’s farm.\r\nAs soon as they have arrived at the armory yard, Father tells the newly freed\r\nslaves who he is, Osawatomie Brown of Kansas, which, as he expected, evokes in\r\nthem a certain fearfulness, until he reveals that his principal ally is the famous\r\nNegro Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave himself, and this seems to impress\r\nand calm them somewhat, for these are Virginia ex-slaves and rebellious types,\r\nsurely, or they would not have come in with Stevens and his men, and being\r\nfrom a border town, they no doubt have had secret access to abolitionist\r\ninformation and literature. He places pikes into their hands and stations them\r\ninside the firehouse to guard the growing number of hostages. For now, these\r\nwhite men are your prisoners, he says. Treat them honestly, for they are\r\nhostages, whom we will deploy if we need to bargain for our continued safety,\r\nand as we will be freeing them later, we want them to tell other white people\r\nthe truth about us, that we want not revenge but liberty.",
    "\r\nThe seven Negroes, a woman and six men, several of them barefoot in the cold\r\nnight, take up their pikes and hesitantly, as if they have no choice in the matter,\r\nfollow their former masters into the firehouse, while Father straps on George\r\nWashington’s scabbard and sword and adds to his pair of old service revolvers\r\nthe General’s engraved pistol and tooled leather holster. In all his armament, he\r\nis a formidable sight, a warrior chieftain, and with his Old Testament beard and\r\nfierce gray eyes and his battered straw hat and Yankee farmer’s woolen frock\r\ncoat and his—to the Negroes, to all people, in fact—peculiar way of speaking, he\r\nis a paradoxical one as well: a man out of time, without a shred of vanity or the\r\nslightest regard for convention, and though an old man, he is as overflowing as a\r\nboy with single-minded purpose and high principles, armed and clothed for no\r\nother task in life than this night’s bloody work. The rest of the men, if they put\r\ntheir rifles down, and the ex-slaves, if they put away their pikes, could easily\r\nfold back into the general populace and disappear from sight, here or anywhere\r\nin America; but not Father: he is Osawatomie Brown of Kansas, and no\r\nAmerican, white or black, Northern or Southern, would mistake him for anybody\r\nelse.\r\nAlthough they are far fewer than he expected by now and seem somewhat\r\nconfused and fearful, the arrival of these, the first of the freed slaves, has excited\r\nFather, and he orders Cook to drive one of the wagons over to the Maryland\r\nside, to the schoolhouse where I and my two men, Barclay Coppoc and Frank\r\nMeriam, will have cached the remainder of our arms, one hundred fifty rifles\r\nand another hundred pistols and most of the thousand sharpened pikes. Cook is\r\nto bring one-third of the pikes back into town, for, surely, by morning there will\r\nbe mutinous slaves thronging to the armory yard.",
    " The remainder of the weapons\r\nare for me and my men to distribute first amongst the insurrectionary slaves who\r\ncome in from Maryland, and then we are to carry the remainder up into the\r\nmountains for eventual dispersal there. By daylight, on both sides of the river,\r\nwe will have hundreds of escaped slaves to arm, Father says, and must be ready\r\nfor them in both places, or they will not believe that we are serious.\r\nFor now, until further orders, the raiders who are inside the town are merely\r\nto hold their positions—Kagi and his men, Copeland and now Leary, over at the\r\nrifle factory on Hall’s Island, Oliver and Will Thompson posted at the\r\nShenandoah bridge, Watson and Taylor still holding the bridge across the\r\nPotomac, and Hazlett and Edwin Coppoc guarding the arsenal; the rest of the\r\nmen stand at the ready here at the center of town, in and around the armory\r\ngrounds and the firehouse.\r\nIt is close to six A.M. The rain has ceased, and the heavy storm clouds have\r\nmoved off, and as dawn approaches, the sky turns slowly to a fluttery, gray,\r\nsilken sheet, with the high, wooded ridges in the east and north silhouetted\r\nagainst it. The brick storefronts and houses and offices of the town and the\r\nnarrow, cobbled streets glisten wetly from the night’s rain, and when the first\r\nlight of the rising sun spreads across the eastern horizon, the faces of the\r\nbuildings here below turn pink and seem almost to bloom, as if in the darkness\r\nof the night they existed only in a nascent form, not quite real.",
    "\r\nBefore long, the first of the armory workers, all unsuspecting, come drifting\r\ninto the center of town in twos and threes from their small wood-frame houses\r\nabove the cliffs on Clay Street, and as they walk through the iron gate into the\r\nyard, Father and the others grab them and make them hostages in the firehouse,\r\nuntil he has close to forty men crowded into the two large rooms and has to\r\nstation several of his raiders inside with the freed slaves to help guard them.\r\nThen, by daylight, just as Father said it would, word of the raid gets out. Dr.\r\nJohn Starry, a local physician, is the first to raise the alarm. Summoned to the\r\nhotel hours earlier to care for the wounded watchman and the dying Hayward\r\nShepherd by a courageous Negro barman who, at risk of his life, slipped out a\r\nside door of the hotel and down dark alleyways to the physician’s house, Dr.\r\nStarry bandages the watchman’s forehead and is at Shepherd’s side when the\r\npoor man dies, after which, accompanied by the barman who brought him there,\r\nhe succeeds in returning to his home undetected, where at once he rouses his\r\nfamily and neighbors. Then he rides to the home of the Superintendent of the\r\nArmory, A. M. Kitzmiller, bringing the scarcely-to-be-believed news. The armory,\r\narsenal, and rifle works and a large group of hostages, including Colonel Lewis\r\nWashington, are all in the hands of an army of abolitionist murderers that is led\r\nby none other than Osawatomie Brown and aided by a wild gang of escaped,\r\nspear-carrying slaves! There is a full-scale insurrection under way! Brown has\r\ntrained cannon on the square, the doctor reports, and is moving all the arms\r\nfrom the town into the interior!",
    "\r\nSoon the bell of the Lutheran church atop the hill starts to clang, summoning\r\nthe citizens to an emergency meeting, and a rider has been sent to\r\nShepherdstown to call out the local militia, and a second has been dispatched to\r\nCharles Town for the Jefferson Guards, formed for the express purpose of\r\nmeeting precisely this circumstance after the Turner rebellion back in ‘31.\r\nFather and his men, when they hear the church bell ringing on and on for ten,\r\nfifteen, twenty minutes, know what is happening. Don’t be frightened, boys,\r\ndon’t panic. There’s still plenty of time, he assures the men. The hostages and\r\npractically every rifle in the town are in our hands. And the Lord is watching\r\nover us. We won’t go down, boys, but if the Lord requires it of us, then it will be\r\nas Samson went. These people know that, and they don’t want it, so we’re still\r\nsafe enough here.\r\nIt is full daylight, around seven A.M., when Father strides through the gate of\r\nthe armory yard and approaches the railroad station and calls out for Mr. Phelps,\r\nthe conductor. Come here, sir! I wish to parley with you! Phelps pokes his head\r\nout the door but refuses to come forward. I have decided to let you move the\r\ntrain on to Baltimore, Father declares. But tell your employer, and tell all the\r\ncivil and military authorities, that this is the last train I will permit in or out of\r\nHarpers Ferry, at the extreme peril of those men we have taken prisoner, until\r\nwe have finished with our business here.\r\nPhelps nods, and he and the engineer and the baggagemaster return to the\r\ntrain, fire it up, and take it slowly towards the covered bridge and across the\r\nPotomac into Maryland.",
    " From the schoolhouse on the heights opposite, I watch\r\nthe train far below snake its way out of the bridge and wind along the north\r\nbank of the river towards Baltimore and Washington beyond, and I know that\r\nwithin minutes, as soon as the train has reached the station at Monocacy, news\r\nof the raid will reach the main offices of the B & O. An hour later, in Richmond,\r\nan aide to Governor Henry Wise will disturb the Governor’s breakfast with\r\nastonishing news, and shortly afterwards, in Washington, D.C., an adjutant\r\ngeneral will burst into the office of the Secretary of War, who will read the wire\r\nfrom Governor Wise requesting federal troops and will at once ask for an\r\nemergency meeting with President Buchanan. More in line with Father’s\r\npurposes—and I know this, too—by evening, every newspaper in the land will\r\nbe shouting the news of our raid:\r\nFEARFUL AND EXCITING INTELLIGENCE! NEGRO INSURRECTION\r\nIN HARPERS FERRY, VIRGINIA, LED BY JOHN BROWN OF KANSAS!!\r\nMANY SLAIN, HUNDREDS TAKEN HOSTAGE, FEDERAL ARMS SEIZED!!!\r\nIn morning light, a few personal weapons, mostly antiquated muskets and\r\nsquirrel guns, have been located by the townspeople, and five or six of the more\r\nadventurous men among them have taken up firing positions on the hillside\r\nabove the armory yard. It is not long, however, before they are spotted by the\r\nraiders, most of them Kansas veterans and much more experienced than the\r\nlocals at this sort of action and possessing weapons of surpassing accuracy, so\r\nthat the townsmen are barely able to open fire, when one of them, a grocer\r\nnamed Boerly, is shot dead by a bullet from a raider rifle, which causes a quick\r\nretreat amongst the others. It is mid-morning.",
    " The militias from Shepherdstown\r\nand Charles Town have not yet arrived, and in Washington, fifty miles to the\r\neast, federal troops are only now being mustered for railroad transport to\r\nHarpers Ferry. Here in town, their feeble efforts at defense effectively curtailed\r\nby the raiders’ deadly accurate Sharps rifles, by their fear of endangering the\r\nhostages, and by their growing certainty that there are many more than Father’s\r\nseventeen raiders occupying the town and hundreds more escaped slaves than\r\nseven, the citizens are limited to taking occasional, erratic potshots in the\r\ngeneral direction of the armory, causing more danger and havoc to themselves\r\nthan to the raiders.\r\nEven so, over at the rifle works on Hall’s Island, Kagi has grown increasingly\r\nanxious about the passage of so much time, for he and his two men, Copeland\r\nand Leary, though they have so far held the factory uncontested, are situated far\r\nfrom the hostages in the firehouse, and thus, of Father’s force, they are the most\r\nvulnerable to attack from the townsmen. Kagi dispatches Leary to town on foot\r\nto request Father to send back a wagon and additional men, so that they can\r\nquickly load the seized weapons from the factory and begin their escape into the\r\nmountains. It is time. None of the raiders has been killed or even wounded.\r\nAccording to the plan, they should all be departing from Harpers Ferry by now.\r\nAnd I, up on the Maryland Heights, should also have left by now. That is the\r\nplan, Father’s plan, his vision of how it would go at Harpers Ferry on the night\r\nof October 16 and the morning of October 17, and everything up to now has\r\ngone accordingly.",
    " Except for the one thing: that the hundreds of escaping slaves\r\nwhom we expected to come rushing to our side have not yet appeared, and the\r\nfew who have are turning fearful and hesitant and may themselves have to be\r\nput under guard and made into hostages.\r\nBut that does not matter, I decide, as I watch from my perch above the town.\r\nFather’s plan can accommodate that, too. We have seized at least three\r\nwagonloads of weapons, we have terrorized the entire South into believing that\r\nan insurrection has begun, and in the North we have raised fresh huzzahs and\r\nenthusiastic promises of material support and a coming flood of volunteer\r\nfighters—we have, indeed, begun an insurrection, which surely, thanks to the\r\npresence of Frederick Douglass, will catch and burst into flame in a matter of\r\nmere days, and if Father leads his men out of Harpers Ferry now and makes his\r\nappointed rendez-vous in the Alleghenies with Mr. Douglass, we will still be able\r\nto feed those flames and follow them into the deeper South, just as Father\r\nwished. It is not too late.\r\nThe slaves will come in, Father insists. They will soon start to arrive. We must\r\ngive them every moment up to the last possible moment to learn of our raid and\r\nour intentions and to overcome their natural fears and flee their masters’ farms\r\nand plantations for the town, which is still under our control. The second we\r\nabandon the town, the escaping slaves will have no place to go where they are\r\nnot in terrible danger. For their sake, we shall continue to hold the town, he\r\ndeclares. Even as the Jefferson Guards ride in on the Charles Town Pike from the\r\nwest and the Shepherdstown militia comes in along the Potomac road from the\r\nnorth and the troop train from Washington slowly approaches from the east.",
    "\r\nChapter 22\r\nWe wake in darkness and long for light, and when the light comes, we wait for\r\ndarkness to return, so that we can descend the rickety ladder from our crowded,\r\nwindowless attic and warm our hands at the kitchen fire and walk about the\r\nyard awhile. We go out of the house either in pairs or alone, so as not to draw\r\nthe attention of some errant nighttime traveler unexpectedly making his late\r\nway past the old Kennedy farm, someone who from the road would surely note,\r\neven in darkness, the presence of a crowd often or more men milling about the\r\nstone-and-white-clapboard house and wonder why they were there. The house is\r\nsurrounded by woods, however, and is fairly remote, with the public road in\r\nfront leading only and indirectly to the country village of Boonesborough, so\r\nthat a pair of men or a man alone, if he remain silent, can walk back and forth\r\nbefore the house unseen for a spell, can stretch his cramped limbs and breathe\r\nthe cool, fresh air of outdoors for the first time in twenty-four hours, and from\r\nthe road no one not warned of a stranger’s presence would see him. Even if by\r\naccident the traveler did catch a glimpse of a stranger or two standing in the\r\nyard, he would think nothing amiss, for Dr. Kennedy’s family, now removed to\r\nBaltimore, has often rented its old, abandoned family farm to landless seasonal\r\nfarmers, which was how John Kagi, when he contracted to rent the place for us,\r\nrepresented Father and his several sons—a Mr. Isaac Smith and his boys, from up\r\nnear Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, looking for good Virginia farmland to buy\r\nand perhaps at the same time to graze and fatten a few head of livestock to\r\nbutcher and sell in the fall to the citizens and armory workers of Harpers Ferry.\r\nKagi, who seems almost to believe his lies himself, has a gift for storytelling.",
    "\r\nThe town of Harpers Ferry and the rifle and musket manufactories and the\r\nfederal arsenal are situated in a deep, narrow gorge three miles south of here, on\r\na spit of terraced, flat-rock land, where the Shenandoah cuts between two high,\r\nwooded ridges and empties into the Potomac. At first sight, it seems an unlikely\r\nplace to make and store an army’s weapons, vulnerable to attack and siege from\r\nthe high bluffs on both sides of both rivers. But Father has explained that none\r\nof our nation’s enemies could attack the town, so far from sea, without first\r\nhaving captured Washington, fifty miles downriver, or Richmond and Baltimore.\r\nThe last place from which the federal government would expect Harpers Ferry to\r\nbe attacked is by land, he says, smiling, and only our fellow Americans could\r\nmanage that. Which is, of course, precisely where and who we are: ensconced\r\nnorthwest of the town up here in the Kennedy farmhouse, fellow Americans\r\ncoming in under cover of darkness one by one from all over the continent—well-\r\narmed young men with anti-slavery principles in their minds and bloody murder\r\nin their hearts.\r\nWe have said our somber final goodbyes to our families and homes in the\r\nNorth and have joined the Old Man here—fifteen white men and five Negro,\r\nwhen we have all assembled—to wait out the days and weeks and, if necessary,\r\nmonths until he tells us finally that the moment we have been waiting for, some\r\nof us for a lifetime, has come. The plan, his meticulously detailed schedule and\r\nbreakdown of operations, he has rehearsed for us over and over again, night\r\nafter night, in the chilled, candlelit room above the one big room of the house,\r\nour prison, as we have come jokingly to call it.",
    " On the basement level, there is a\r\nkitchen, where sister Annie and Oliver’s new wife, Martha, have settled in to\r\ncook and launder for us—they arrived back in mid-July, after Father, having\r\ndetermined that our disguise as land speculators and provenders of meat\r\nrequired the presence of womenfolk, summoned them down from North Elba. A\r\nshort ways from the house is a locked shed, where we have stored our weapons,\r\nwhich we periodically clean and maintain to break the monotony of our\r\nconfinement-some two hundred Sharps rifles and that many more pistols and a\r\nthousand sharpened steel-tipped pikes, all paid for by Father’s secret supporters\r\nand shipped to Isaac Smith & Sons piecemeal over the summer months from\r\nOhio and Hartford by way of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in wooden cases\r\nmarked “Hardware and Castings.” John Kagi, who once taught school in the area\r\nand knows it well, has functioned as our main advance agent here and has\r\nfacilitated these delicate operations. Also, John Cook has been here for nearly a\r\nyear already, sent down from Iowa by Father as a spy, because of his intelligence\r\nand Yale education and his much-admired social skills, and he has managed\r\nwithout arousing suspicion to gain employment as a canal-lock tender and last\r\nspring even married a local girl, whom he had got with child, which naturally\r\ndid not particularly please Father, but it helped Cook settle into the daily life of\r\nthe town, and that has proved useful.\r\nWe ourselves have arrived in a trickle, a few at a time.",
    " First, on July 3, Father\r\nand I and our old Kansas cohort Jeremiah Anderson came in by wagon from\r\nNorth Elba, and then soon after came Oliver and Watson and the Thompson\r\nboys, William, who earlier wished to be in Kansas with us and his brother Henry\r\nbut never made it off the Thompson farm, and his younger brother Dauphin,\r\nonly twenty years old, by nature a sweet and gentle boy, but who over the years\r\nhas come practically to worship Father. From Maine comes Charlie Tidd and\r\nwith him Aaron Stevens, both hardened veterans of the Kansas campaign, and\r\nshortly after them, Albert Hazlett rides a wagon in, followed by the Canadian\r\nStewart Taylor, the spiritualist, who is convinced that he alone will die at\r\nHarpers Ferry and seems almost to welcome it, as if his death is a small price to\r\npay for the survival of the rest of us. A week later, the Coppoc brothers, Edwin\r\nand Barclay, will arrive at the farmhouse, lapsed Quakers who trained with us in\r\nIowa. Then, late in the summer, Willie Leeman will walk all the way in from\r\nMaine, and shortly after him come the first of the Negroes, Osborn Anderson and\r\nDangerfield Newby, which pleases Father immensely, for he has begun to grow\r\nfearful that his army will be made up only of white men. In the end, there will\r\nbe four more men to join us at the Kennedy farm: the Bostonian Francis Meriam,\r\nunstable and inspired to join us by his recent visit with the journalist Redpath to\r\nthe black republic of Haiti; and John Copeland, Lewis Leary, and Shields Green,\r\nthe last three of them Ohio Negroes, which, not counting our commander-in-\r\nchief, rounds out our number at twenty.\r\nBut do not fear, this number will be sufficient unto our present needs, Father\r\nhas declared. We have pared away from our side all those men who would\r\ndefeat us through their cowardice and faithlessness. We now have only the\r\nenemy to fight.",
    " July has turned into August and is moving rapidly towards\r\nautumn, and as each new recruit joins us, Father begins his narrative anew, an\r\nold jeremiad against slavery that lapses into fresh prophecy of its demise, as\r\nweekly he adjusts his plan for the taking of Harpers Ferry, so that it reflects the\r\nskills and personalities of the new arrivals, his increased belief in his recruits’\r\ncommitment to the raid, and his growing awareness that in the end there will be\r\nfar fewer of us than he anticipated. The arrival of Mr. Douglass will, of course,\r\nalter things considerably, even if he comes alone, but it’s mainly afterwards that\r\nhis presence will revise our circumstances and operations, Father points out,\r\nafter we have seized the town and the cry has gone out across the Virginia\r\ncountryside that Osawatomie Brown and Frederick Douglass have begun their\r\nlong-awaited war to liberate the slaves. That’s when our sharpened pikes, with\r\ntheir six-foot ash handles and eight-inch knife blades bolted to the top, will go\r\ninto action. Father believes that most of the slaves who join up with us will not\r\nbe much experienced in the use of firearms, but until they can be trained and\r\nproperly armed, these weapons will do them fine. Besides, the very sight of\r\nrazor-sharp spears in the hands of vengeful liberated Negroes will help terrorize\r\nthe slaveholders. Terror is one of our weapons, he says. Perhaps our strongest\r\nweapon. Until then, however, and for now, this is the plan.\r\nFrom our blanket rolls scattered over the rough plank floor, we prop our heads\r\nin our hands and listen to our commander-in-chief, and each of us sees himself\r\nplaying his role flawlessly, not missing a cue or a line, as if he were an actor in a\r\nperfectly executed play.",
    " Father sits on a stool in the center of the attic, and as\r\nusual, he first hectors and inspires us with his rhetoric and then runs through his\r\nplan yet again. He is the author of the play and its stage-manager and master of\r\ncostumes and scenery and all our properties, and he is the lead actor as well—\r\nalong with Mr. Douglass, of course, we mustn’t forget him, for without Frederick\r\nDouglass, no matter how successful the first act is played, the second and third\r\nwill surely fail. There may not even be a second or third. Everyone knows that.\r\nFather will reveal more about those acts later, he says, but for now we need be\r\nmindful only that it is overall a work, a performance, whose second and\r\ncontinuing acts will require not one hero but two.\r\nThe rest of us are important players, too, we know, but compared to the Old\r\nMan and Mr. Douglass, minor. Father insists that no, each one of us is as crucial\r\nto the success of this operation as every other: from top to bottom, we are a\r\nchain, and if one link breaks, the entire chain comes undone. But still, we know\r\nbetter. And so does he. Each of us twenty is replaceable, and until Mr. Douglass\r\narrives, this will be the Old Man’s show, and then it will belong to the two of\r\nthem. It will never belong to us. Meanwhile, however, we listen to the Old Man’s\r\ndirections and memorize our lines and positions, so that when at last\r\nOsawatomie Brown steps onto the stage and begins the action, we will be able to\r\nfollow his lead and efficiently prepare the way for the entry of the famous\r\nFrederick Douglass and his thousands of Negro actors, all of whom are as yet\r\nunrehearsed and have been cast as players only in our imaginations.\r\nEven so, the time to act is fast approaching, Father tells us.",
    " Already there have\r\nappeared numerous signs from the Lord—such as the sudden recent arrival of\r\nthe pikes from Chambersburg, where they had been oddly delayed for weeks,\r\ndespite Kagi’s best attempts to get them released and sent on to us. And soon\r\nfrom the Lord there will come additional signs, emblems and omens dressed as\r\nincidental events and information, to encourage us and make us the more eager\r\nto risk our lives in battle rather than continue with this suffocating waiting game\r\nat the farm on the Maryland Heights. For instance, Father will dispatch Cook\r\ndown along the Charles Town Turnpike to determine the numbers and\r\ndisposition of the slaves there, his only attempt to reconnoiter the region beyond\r\nthe town of Harpers Ferry itself, and Cook will return aflame with news that the\r\nmoon is right for insurrection, for it is nearly a dog-tooth moon, the type that\r\nmakes Africans particularly discontented, he has learned. This, too, is a sign\r\nfrom the Lord, Father tells us. Cook has also been told of a young male slave at a\r\nfarm nearby who just yesterday hung himself because his owner sold the man’s\r\nwife down South. A shipment of spears suddenly released, a dog-tooth moon,\r\nand a hanging man: on the strength of these and other similarly propitious\r\nportents, Father has sent sister Annie and Martha back home to North Elba. We\r\nare now awaiting only the arrival of Mr. Douglass, who we hope will bring with\r\nhim a phalanx of well-armed Negro fighters from the North, although Father\r\nwarns us that lately letters from his black cohorts back there are suggesting\r\notherwise.\r\nFinally, one night Father climbs up to our attic with his lamp in one hand and\r\na fat packet of papers and maps in the other, and taking his customary seat at\r\nthe center of the group, he spreads the contents of his packet at his feet.",
    " As he\r\nbegins to speak, he raises one of the maps from the pile—we see at once that it is\r\nthe now-familiar drawing of the streets and buildings of Harpers Ferry, made by\r\nCook—and, as usual, he shows it to us and allows it to be passed amongst us, so\r\nthat, while Father sets out the plan, each man can better visualize what he is to\r\ndo and where he shall stand when he does it. This time, however, when he has\r\ngone through, once again, step by step, the taking of Harpers Ferry, he retrieves\r\nand sets aside Cook’s map and is silent and looks somberly at his clasped hands,\r\nas if in prayer. After a long moment, without looking up, he abruptly declares\r\nthat tonight he has decided to reveal to us that we will not be conducting the\r\nsort of raid that most of us still believe we have come here for. This is not to be\r\nmerely a larger, more dangerous and dramatic, slave-running expedition than\r\nany of us has ever undertaken before. There is instead a much larger task before\r\nus, a greater thing than we have yet dared imagine.\r\nKagi has long known of this grand, about-to-be-revealed scheme, as have I, of\r\ncourse, and a few of the others, Cook, Stevens, and Anderson, and we have\r\nargued privately amongst ourselves as to its feasibility and have agreed, after\r\nmuch disputation, that it can be done and must be attempted; but my brothers\r\nWatson and Oliver have not heard it before, nor my brothers-in-law Will and\r\nDauphin Thompson, nor has Father until now trusted any of the recent arrivals\r\nwith this vision, for it is truly a vision and not so much a plan, and to see it as he\r\ndoes, we must first for a long time not have seen or heard much else. Our long\r\nconfinement together and our isolation from the world outside have finally made\r\nus all visionaries, capable at last of seeing what Father sees and of believing his\r\nwords as if they were true prophecy.",
    "\r\nHere, men, I want you to examine these maps, he says, and he picks up and\r\nflaps at us a set of cambric-cloth squares onto which he has pasted the states of\r\nVirginia, Maryland, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and the Carolinas\r\n—eight squares, and one state to a square. In the margin of each map, he has\r\nwritten numerals: 491,000, for the number of slaves in Virginia, he explains,\r\n87,000 in Maryland, and so on, which comes to a total of 1,996,366 slaves, he\r\npronounces, looking up at us. But he does not see us, his twenty followers,\r\nunshaven, unwashed, gaunt, and sober-faced, all of us young men and a few of\r\nus mere boys: instead, his gray eyes gleam with excitement at the sight of a\r\nspreading black wave of mutinous slaves, nearly two million strong, as all across\r\nthe South they flee their cabins and shops and barns and rise from the cotton\r\nand tobacco and sugarcane fields and take up pitchforks, axes, machetes, and the\r\nthousands of Sharps rifles that will come flowing down the Alleghenies from the\r\nNorth; he sees them, first hundreds, then thousands, and finally hundreds of\r\nthousands of black men, women, and children, flowing down the country roads\r\nand highways, meeting in town squares and on city streets and merging into the\r\nlargest army ever seen in this land, an army with but one purpose, and that is to\r\ntake back from the slaveholders what for a quarter of a millennium has been\r\nstolen from them—their freedom, their American birthrights, their very lives.\r\nThis raid will establish no Underground Railroad operation, he tells us, for\r\nregardless of scale, it is no mere slave raid. This will be an act of an entirely\r\ndifferent order. Yes, after we have taken Harpers Ferry, we will make our\r\nappointed rendezvous with Mr.",
    " Douglass in the Allegheny foothills west of here,\r\nas planned, but then we will not, as some of us believed, hole up in small forts\r\nand siphon escaped slaves into the North. Instead, we shall divide our forces into\r\ntwo portions, the Defenders, under Mr. Douglass’s command, and the Liberators,\r\nunder Father’s, and whilst the Defenders protect and hurry into the North those\r\nwomen, children, elderly, and infirm slaves who wish to resettle there, the\r\nLiberators will commence to march rapidly southward along the densely wooded\r\nnorth-south mountain passes, making lightning-like strikes against the\r\nplantations on the plains lower down, seizing armories and arsenals and supplies\r\nas they go, building a cavalry, like Toussaint L’Ouverture, and even seizing\r\nartillery, like the Maroons of Jamaica, destroying railroads and fortifications.\r\nWhen the Shenandoah Valley goes, the plantations along the James River will\r\nquickly fall, and then the Tidewater tobacco farms, and when Virginia goes, the\r\nrest of the Southern states will nearly conquer themselves, there being down\r\nthere, as in Haiti and Jamaica, such a disproportionate number of Negroes to\r\nwhites. And there will be thousands of non-slaveholding whites, too, God-\r\nfearing, decent Southerners, who will come running to our side, once they\r\nunderstand that our true intentions are not to slay white men and women in\r\ntheir beds or to overthrow their state or federal government or to dissolve the\r\nUnion, but merely to end American slavery. To end it now, here, in these years.\r\nLook, look! he says, excitedly showing us the map of Alabama, where with X’she\r\nhas marked, county by county, the heaviest concentrations of slaves.",
    " When we\r\nemerge from the Tennessee hills here in Augusta County, the slaves will rise up\r\nspontaneously in adjacent Montgomery County, and in a week or perhaps two,\r\nwhen the news has arrived there, the same will occur in Macon and Russell\r\nCounties, and the flames of rebellion will leap like a wildfire from one district to\r\nthe next, straight across into Georgia, whence the fire will roar all the way east\r\nto the Sea Isles, causing it to curl back north into the Carolinas, until we have\r\nignited a great, encircling conflagration, which cannot be extinguished until it\r\nhas burnt the ancient sin and scourge of slavery entirely away, from one end of\r\nthe South to the other, from Maryland to Louisiana, until at last nothing remains\r\nof the Slavocracy but a smoldering pile of char!\r\nThe Old Man’s peroration ends and is met with soft silence. At first, Kagi,\r\nCook, Stevens, and Anderson look slowly around the dim, shadowy room, as if\r\nsearching the faces of the others for a sign that their collective silence indicates\r\ncollective skepticism, which was Kagi’s early reaction to Father’s vision, or\r\ndismay, Cook’s and Stevens’s first response, or simple awe, Anderson’s. I myself\r\nlook to my brothers’ eyes, Watson and Oliver, seeking there a clarifying version\r\nof my own thoughts and feelings, for in my earlier disputations with Kagi, Cook,\r\nand Stevens, I defended the logic of Father’s grand plan with no other desire\r\nthan to defeat their objections to it, my old role, and in winning them over have\r\nnot made my own private position strong to myself or even clear. But it is too\r\nlate. Watson and Oliver and the Thompsons, my brothers and brothers-in-law, all\r\nof the men, wear on their faces a single expression, the expression worn also by\r\nKagi, Cook, Stevens, and Anderson, and no doubt by me, too: it is the hungry\r\nlook of a follower, of a true believer.",
    " There is no Thomas the Doubter in this\r\nroom, no sober skeptic, no ironist, no dark materialist. We have all been\r\nconfined here in this isolated place for too many weeks and months to have any\r\nmentality left that is not a piece of a single mind, and that mind is shaped and\r\nfilled by Father alone.\r\nBut, yes, much of what you have expected will be met, he continues, calmer\r\nnow, comforted by our silence. He again holds out Cook’s large, detailed map of\r\nthe streets and buildings of Harpers Ferry and says that we shall indeed, as we\r\nhave intended all along, soon attack and seize the town. That has not changed. It\r\nwill be our first formally declared act of war against the slaveholders, the first\r\nact of our mighty drama. And when we have seized the town, we shall, as\r\nplanned, take control of the arms stored in three buildings there—the\r\ngovernment armory, where the muskets are made, the Hall rifle works, and the\r\narsenal. As we all know, there are no federal troops presently posted in the town\r\nand only a few private guards protecting these stores of weapons and munitions,\r\nso we will not be much opposed, and if we strike quickly and under cover of\r\nnight, it will be done before we are even noticed by the townspeople. We shall\r\nnevertheless take hostages and hold them, probably in the armory yard, to\r\nprotect us against the local militias, should they be roused, whilst we await the\r\nfirst reinforcing arrival of mutinous slaves from the surrounding countryside,\r\nand then, in a matter of hours, we shall have flown back up into the mountain\r\nfastness south and west of the town, whence shall come our Republic’s salvation.\r\nShortly after nightfall on a Sabbath, it will begin with a fervent prayer offered\r\nup to God, that we may be assisted by Him in the total, final liberation of all the\r\nslaves on this continent.",
    " We shall not ask the Lord to spare or even to protect our\r\nown lives in this venture: our lives have been pledged strictly to our duty; that is\r\nall. We must not ask the Lord to release us of our duty. Then, with everyone\r\ngathered in the room below, so that we may be mentally clear as to our legal\r\nrights and obligations and our principles, Aaron Stevens, who has the most\r\nimpressive voice of us all, will read aloud Father’s Provisional Constitution and\r\nOrdinances for the People of the United States, which so nobly begins: Whereas\r\nslavery is a most barbarous, unprovoked, and unjustifiable war of one portion of its\r\ncitizens upon another portion in utter disregard and violation of those eternal and self-\r\nevident truths set forth in our Declaration of Independence: therefore, we, citizens of\r\nthe United States, and the oppressed people who, by a recent decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt, are declared to have no rights which the white man is bound to respect,\r\ntogether with all other people degraded by the laws thereof, do, for the time being,\r\nordain and establish for ourselves the following Provisional Constitution and\r\nOrdinances. He will read all forty-five articles, ending thusly, with the carefully\r\nworded reassurance that The foregoing articles shall not be construed so as in any\r\nway to encourage the overthrow of any State government, or of the general\r\ngovernment of the United States, and look to no dissolution of the\r\nUnion, but simply to amendment and repeal. And our flag shall be the same that\r\nour fathers fought under in the Revolution.\r\nFollowing this somber recitation, our commander-in-chief will administer\r\nanew to us as a group the same oath of secrecy that, individually, upon our first\r\narrival at the farm, each of us has already been sworn to. Father then will say\r\nsimply, “Men, get on your arms. We now proceed to the Ferry.",
    "”\r\nI am to stay behind with Francis Meriam and Barclay Coppoc, the two men\r\nFather and I have come to view as the weakest links in our chain, the one\r\nbecause of his physical frailty and tendency to hysteria, the other because of his\r\nyouth and his residual Quaker timidity. I would prefer to be at the front with\r\nFather and the others, but I know better than to object to this assignment, for no\r\none else in the group can be trusted with it, he says, and besides, it places me in\r\na position of authority as second-in-command and at Father’s flank, so that if\r\nsomething goes dreadfully wrong, my duty will be to rescue them. My\r\nimmediate charge, however, is to transfer all the arms from the house and\r\nstorage shed, except for those taken by the advance party, to a small, unused\r\nschoolhouse situated in the woods overlooking the Potomac and directly across\r\nthe river from Harpers Ferry, there to await the first arrival of liberated slaves,\r\nto arm them and lead them into the mountains, where a few days later we will\r\nrendez-vous with Father and the others. On his map of Virginia, Father shows us\r\nour Allegheny meeting place in Frederick County, which he himself scouted\r\nyears ago, while on a surveying expedition of lands owned by Oberlin College.\r\nMr. Douglass should have joined us by then, Father assures us, and will take\r\noverall command of my unit. I am to remain as captain of the new recruits,\r\nhowever, and as executive officer of the operation, until Father himself has\r\njoined us. After that, I am to ride at Father’s side with the Liberators. I have also\r\nbeen charged with the obligation to remove or destroy any incriminating\r\nevidence that we might have left here at the farmhouse, such as letters, maps,\r\njournals, and other personal effects.\r\nWe have in our possession two wagons, one for my use and the other for\r\nFather’s advance party.",
    " It must be on a night with no moon shining, no stars, a\r\nnight overcast and drear, and when Father’s men have loaded their wagon with\r\nthe half a hundred pikes and twenty rifles they require for the taking of Harpers\r\nFerry, immediately and without ceremony, at a simple command from Father,\r\nthey will set off down the public road, Father perched on the wagon seat with\r\nhis head uncharacteristically bent forward, stooped as if in deep thought or\r\nprayer, and our old North Elba farmhorse, the bay Morgan mare, between the\r\nshafts, and the sixteen men marching silently in the cold drizzle alongside the\r\nwagon and behind. I will stand by the door of the house with Meriam and young\r\nBarclay Coppoc and watch them disappear into the darkness as if being\r\nswallowed by it. I do not know yet what I will feel when that moment comes,\r\nbut it will not be fear or dread. It is too late for that.\r\nAfter a few moments, when we can no longer hear the tramp of their boots on\r\nthe wet ground or the creak and chop of their wagon and horse, my two men\r\nand I will turn quickly to our tasks—Meriam and Coppoc to load our wagon with\r\nthe remaining weapons from the shed, whilst I gather all our scattered papers\r\nfrom the house. By candlelight, I will prowl carefully through the entire house,\r\nfrom basement kitchen to our attic hideout, collecting every shred of paper I can\r\nfind and stuffing all of it loosely into a cloth valise. To my slight surprise, I will\r\nbe obliged to fill the bag several times over, emptying it each time in the\r\nbasement next to the woodstove on the flagstone floor of the kitchen. Soon I will\r\nhave made a large, disordered pile, at first glance much of it rubbish, which I\r\nplan to separate from the rest and burn.",
    " But when I commence to sort the\r\npapers, I will discover with a little shock that most of the remaining papers, a\r\nwhole heap of them, are Father’s, and amongst them are dozens of letters, many\r\nfrom family members in North Elba and Ohio, and numerous others, only\r\nslightly coded, written by his secret Northern supporters, Dr. Howe, Gerrit\r\nSmith, Franklin Sanborn, and so on, and even several letters from Frederick\r\nDouglass, and receipts for Father’s purchases of arms back in Iowa and Ohio and\r\nfor the pikes in Hartford, Connecticut, and here are all of Father’s maps, the very\r\nmaps with which he showed us his grand plan, and Cook’s drawing of Harpers\r\nFerry, and Father’s pocket notebooks, where he has listed, county by county, as\r\non his maps, slave population figures taken from the 1850 national census, and\r\nthe names of many towns and cities of the South and their marching distance\r\nfrom one another, such as Montgomery to Memphis, 3 da., and Charleston to\r\nSavannah, 2 1/2 da. I have known this would happen, for I have seen most of\r\nthese papers, maps, and notebooks lying carelessly about for weeks, as if, having\r\nshown them to us, Father no longer wished to order or hide them, and I have felt\r\na twinge of fear that, in the rush of last-minute preparations, he would neglect to\r\ntake them up. But I would not reflect upon it until later, until after Father and I\r\nhad ridden up for our final, secret meeting with Mr. Douglass in Chambersburg.\r\nWhile I clear the house and my men stack the arms into our wagon, Father and\r\nhis men will be nearing the covered bridge that crosses the Potomac from\r\nMaryland into the state of Virginia and the town of Harpers Ferry. This is how it\r\nwill go. Around nine o’clock, the drizzle shifts over to a straight rain.",
    " At ten-\r\nthirty, they reach the Maryland Heights, a steep, wooded thousand-foot-high cliff\r\nabove the cut of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge. Although from up here it\r\nis too dark to make out the shapes of the brick-front buildings and cobbled\r\nstreets below, the men can see through the rain a few dim, last lights from the\r\nslumbering town. Passing by the abandoned log schoolhouse, where I am to\r\nstore our weapons and later arm the escaping slaves, Father and his men descend\r\non the narrow, winding lane to the grassy riverbank and march for a while\r\nalongside the wide, swift-flowing, steel-colored river to the covered bridge,\r\nwhich crosses to Harpers Ferry a short ways upstream from the place where the\r\neast-running Potomac River is joined from the south by the Shendandoah. Well\r\nin sight of the bridge now, its wide, black entrance beckoning like the mouth of\r\na gigantic serpent, they leave the road and cross the C & O Canal at lock 23 and\r\nmake their way in the cold rain along the tow path to the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nRailroad tracks running in from the east. Here the tracks turn, cross the canal,\r\nand pass through the covered bridge alongside the narrow roadway, passing over\r\nthe wide, gray river in pitch darkness to the station and loading platforms in the\r\ntown center, where they turn again and lead out of town on the further side of\r\nthe Potomac into western Virginia and on to Ohio.\r\nFather and his men are well down in the gorge now, as if they have entered\r\nthe den of the monstrous snake. Behind them and before them on their left, like\r\nthick, black curtains hanging from the blacker sky, loom high walls, where\r\nclusters of scrub oak and thickets of thorn bushes cling to wet, rocky\r\nescarpments all the way to the tops, and tall, windblown chestnut and walnut\r\ntrees rise from the bluffs above.",
    " There can be no return now: Father and his men\r\nhave reached the bridge over the Potomac and must enter it and go on, straight\r\ninto the town at the further end. Father halts the wagon at the entrance for a\r\nmoment and stations Watson and Stewart Taylor as a rear guard on the\r\nMaryland side. Then, at the Old Man’s command, Kagi and Stevens march\r\nstraight into the mouth of the bridge. Fifty yards back, Father follows in the\r\nrumbling wagon, and the rest of the men, rifles at the ready and cartridge boxes\r\nclipped to the outside of their clothing for quick access, march wordlessly along\r\nbehind, walking stiffly on the loose planks, as if on ice, and taking shallow, tight\r\nbreaths, as if afraid to fill their chests with the blackness that surrounds them.\r\nA few moments later, Kagi and Stevens emerge from the long throat of the\r\nbridge. They are the first of the raiders to enter the town, and as soon as they\r\nhave set their boots onto the rain-slicked cobbles of Potomac Street, a watchman\r\nhears their step and calls, Who goes there! Kagi answers, Hallo, Billy Williams!\r\nIt’s a friend! The watchman draws close to the two and lifts his lantern and says,\r\nOh, it’s Mister Kagi who’s out so late, and they instantly throw down on him and\r\ntake him prisoner and douse his lamp.\r\nThe raid has begun. Osawatomie Brown and his men are inside Harpers Ferry\r\nand have taken their first hostage. The raiders are able to breathe and walk\r\nnormally now, and they move rapidly and efficiently from one place and\r\nsituation to the next, exactly as planned and rehearsed. Turning right on\r\nPotomac Street at the B & O train depot, they pass the deserted porch and\r\ndarkened windows of the Wager Hotel, where the last guests have finally gone\r\nupstairs to their rooms, and head straight towards the armory, a long double row\r\nof brick buildings situated between the railroad siding and the canal.",
    " On the left,\r\nadjacent to the gate of the armory grounds, there is a square brick building, a\r\nsingle-storey, two-room structure that serves as a fire-engine house for the town\r\nand a guardhouse for the armory. When Father has drawn the wagon close to the\r\niron gate, the armory watchman, whose name is Daniel Whelan, cracks open the\r\ntimbered door of the firehouse, pauses, squints into the darkness, and then\r\nreluctantly steps outside into the rain. In a sleepy voice, he says, That you,\r\nWilliams?\r\nOpen the gate, Mister Whelan, Father says.\r\nYou’re not Williams, says the watchman, more confused than frightened. At\r\nonce, Oliver and Newby step forward with their rifles leveled and take him\r\nprisoner. Aaron Stevens grabs the crowbar from the wagon bed and twists it into\r\nthe chain holding the gate. When the lock snaps, he and Kagi swing open the\r\ngate, and Father drives the wagon straight into the yard. The other men,\r\nincluding the two captured watchmen, follow at gunpoint, and Kagi swings the\r\ngate closed again.\r\nNow Father climbs down from the wagon and, turning to his dumbfounded\r\nprisoners, declares that he has come here from Kansas, for this is a slave state,\r\nand he has come to free all its Negro slaves.\r\nWilliams and Whelan look wide-eyed in disbelief at the old man. The rain\r\ndrips from the tattered brim of his hat and from his white beard. Barely hearing\r\nhis words, they stare at him, this bony, sharp-eyed old fellow in the frock coat,\r\nwho, except for his rifle and the two pistols at his waist, resembles more a poor,\r\nhardscrabble farmer from the hills than a Yankee liberator of slaves, and they\r\nlook around at the small, shabbily dressed, heavily armed group of white and\r\nNegro young men who stand near him, and finally at each other, and say\r\nnothing. What is happening here? For Williams and Whelan, this is a strange,\r\nwaking dream, a shared hallucination.",
    "\r\nI have taken possession of the United States armory, the old man calmly\r\ncontinues. And if the citizens of the town interfere with me and my men, we\r\nmust burn the town and have blood.\r\nFather now proceeds to dispatch his men so as to take control of the remaining\r\narms supplies and defenses of the town. Under guard by Dauphin Thompson and\r\nLewis Leary, the two hostages are shut into the firehouse, while Oliver and Will\r\nThompson are sent three blocks south on Shenandoah Street to take command of\r\nthe bridge that crosses the Shenandoah River into town. The tollbooth proves to\r\nbe empty and the bridge unguarded. Hazlett and Edwin Coppoc take over the\r\narsenal, also unguarded, just off the main square and in sight of the hotel, where\r\nthey will wait for further orders and a wagon to empty it. Stevens, Kagi, and\r\nCopeland are ordered to the rifle factory, which is located a short ways further\r\ndown Shenandoah Street at Lower Hall’s Island, a long, narrow rise of land in\r\nthe Shendandoah River that is separated from the shore by a canal. Once more, a\r\nsingle watchman is surprised by the raiders and, when captured, is marched by\r\nStevens back to the firehouse, leaving Kagi and Copeland behind to hold the rifle\r\nworks. On his return to the firehouse, Stevens comes upon three half-drunk,\r\nunarmed young men, carousers straggling home late from the Wager Hotel, and\r\nhe swiftly puts them under his gun and brings them in with the watchman.\r\nIt is not yet midnight, and both bridges into town, the armory, the arsenal, and\r\nthe rifle factory have been brought under the control of the raiders. Six men\r\nhave been taken hostage and locked into the firehouse. Unknown to the rest of\r\nits citizens, unknown to the world, Harpers Ferry, Virginia, belongs to\r\nOsawatomie Brown. Around this time, the rain lets up, and the clouds slowly\r\npull away and open the starry sky to view.",
    " Soon the dog-tooth moon breaks the\r\ndark horizon above the Maryland Heights north of town, where, just before one\r\nA.M., as Father expected, a fourth watchman, Patrick Higgins, comes down the\r\nmoonlit footpath from his home in Sandy Hook to relieve Williams at the\r\nMaryland side of the Potomac bridge. As he enters the covered bridge, Watson\r\nand Stewart Taylor, Father’s rear guard, step from the shadows and capture the\r\nman. In silence, dutifully following the plan, they direct their prisoner to the\r\nbridge and commence marching him over to the firehouse, when suddenly\r\nHiggins turns and swats Watson on the forehead and races ahead of them into\r\nthe darkness. Before Watson can stay his hand, Taylor raises his rifle and fires,\r\nhis bullet slightly grazing the forehead of the escaping man, who is able\r\nnonetheless to get safely to the end of the bridge and into the Wager Hotel,\r\nwhere he is the first to raise the alarm, although he cannot say who has shot at\r\nhim or why.\r\nThis is an eventuality that Father has anticipated, a part of his overall plan,\r\nand so long as it happens after the bridges and the arms stores have been\r\ncaptured and hostages have been taken, it does not much concern him that\r\nsometime in the night a shot or two will be fired, alerting the citizens that a\r\nviolent action is under way. By daylight, they will know of it, anyhow, and will\r\nbe told by him then of its purpose, and soon the whole country will begin to\r\napprehend its scale. After all, this raid is meant to be a public act, not a private\r\none, he has reminded us, and if our aims are to be met, we must actually invite a\r\ncertain hue-and-cry and, so long as we are in control of events and not they us,\r\nwelcome it. Still, the echoing sound of the first shot shocks the men, and\r\nWatson’s and Taylor’s breathless report that their prisoner has escaped into the\r\nhotel frightens them.",
    " Father, however, is calm as ice.\r\nAt this moment, he is mainly concerned with Aaron Stevens’s mission into the\r\ncountryside. He has sent Stevens with Tidd and Cook and three of the Negro\r\nmen, Anderson, Leary, and Green, five miles west of Harpers Ferry to Halltown,\r\nwhere resides the wealthy planter Colonel Lewis Washington, a man who is a\r\ndirect descendant of General George Washington and, for that, something of a\r\nlocal celebrity and politician, an aide to Virginia’s Governor Wise. Further, he is\r\nknown to have inherited from his incomparable ancestor an elaborately\r\nengraved pistol presented to the General after the Revolution by the Marquis de\r\nLafayette and a ceremonial sword given him by King Frederick the Great of\r\nPrussia. The Old Man wants Colonel Lewis Washington as a hostage, and he\r\nwants to free the Colonel’s half-dozen slaves, but most of all, to help place his\r\nown acts into their proper context, he wants General George Washington’s pistol\r\nand his sword.\r\nWith a rail pulled from the fence by the meadow in front of the house, Stevens\r\nand his men batter down the Colonel’s door and roust him and his terrified\r\nfamily from their beds. When the Colonel has dressed and has delivered over to\r\nthe raiders his ancestor’s famous weapons, Stevens formally places him under\r\narrest and, leaving the man’s wife and young children behind, seats him next to\r\nTidd in a two-horse carriage appropriated from the barn. Behind them,\r\nAnderson, Leary, and Green have hitched the Colonel’s four remaining horses to\r\na farm wagon and have placed into it three liberated slaves, two men and a\r\nyoung woman—all they could find in the house and barn, or maybe they’re the\r\nonly Negroes on the place not too frightened to show themselves, Anderson\r\nexplains to Stevens, for these poor people can’t know for sure yet that we are\r\nwho we say we are.",
    " Stevens agrees, and they start back along the Charles Town\r\nTurnpike towards Harpers Ferry.\r\nA mile west of Bolivar Heights, still following Father’s orders, they draw the\r\nwagons up before a large farm owned by John Allstadt, after Colonel\r\nWashington the wealthiest planter in the region and, like him, a slaveholder—\r\nthe owner, in fact, of the young woman who was sold off into the Deep South\r\nand her young husband who a week ago hung himself because of it. A second\r\ntime, Stevens and his men break down a front door and enter a stranger’s home\r\nunopposed. They quickly make hostages of the man of the house, Mr. Allstadt,\r\nand his eighteen-year-old son, and unceremoniously liberate Allstadt’s four\r\nremaining slaves, who are added to the group in the farm wagon. As instructed,\r\nStevens and the other raiders are scrupulously polite to their prisoners and to the\r\nwomen and children, just as they were at Colonel Washington’s, and they try not\r\nto frighten them overmuch and take pains to cause no unnecessary damage to\r\nthe house or personal property, other than that of converting the slaves into free\r\nmen and women. They state clearly to the whites their sole reason for breaking\r\ninto their homes in the middle of the night and making prisoners of the\r\nhusbands and sons—which is strictly to end slavery. If we are not opposed,\r\nStevens says, no blood will be spilt. The husbands and sons, like the wagons and\r\nhorses, will eventually be returned to them, but their slaves are no longer owned\r\nby them, he says. The slaves of Virginia are owned henceforth by themselves and\r\ncannot be returned to any man.\r\nIn the meantime, back at Harpers Ferry, at 1:25 A.M.",
    ", precisely as scheduled,\r\nthe Baltimore-bound B & O passenger train rolls in, and when it has hissed to a\r\nnoisy stop at the station, the night clerk from the hotel next door skitters low\r\nfrom the door of the railroad station, and before the conductor can step down\r\nfrom the train to the platform, the man has leapt aboard, bearing the startling\r\nnews that gunmen are out on the Potomac bridge and have shot a watchman,\r\nwho lies bleeding inside the hotel! Worse, the other three town watchmen are\r\nnowhere about and may even have been murdered! And here’s something else:\r\nwhen the clerk slipped unseen into the station by a rear window adjacent to the\r\nhotel, he tried to telegraph the stationmaster in Charles Town and discovered\r\nthat the wires had been cut. There is something very strange, something\r\ndangerous, happening, and until now, with no idea of how many gunmen might\r\nbe out there or where they may be hiding, no one but the night clerk has dared\r\nto leave the hotel or been able to raise a general alarm.\r\nThe conductor, A. J. Phelps, takes immediate charge and directs the engineer\r\nand the baggagemaster, who carries a pistol, to step from the train and\r\ninvestigate the bridge, for it may have been sabotaged. Who knows but what\r\nthese gunmen are train robbers and have blocked the bridge somehow? If the\r\ntracks appear clear, he says, they straightway will pass across the river and, at\r\nthe station in Monococy in Maryland, will telegraph the news of these startling\r\nevents over to Charles Town, the county seat, where there is a federal marshal’s\r\noffice and a regiment of town militia available for help.",
    "\r\nSleepy passengers peer out their windows, wondering why the delay, as the\r\nengineer and the baggagemaster, his pistol at the ready, walk slowly along the\r\nstation platform, step down to the railbed, and crunch over the cinders and\r\ngravel towards the dark mouth of the covered bridge. When the pair are about\r\nfifteen feet from the entrance, Watson speaks to them from the darkness ahead.\r\nDrop your pistol, sir, and both of you walk slowly towards us. Keep your hands\r\nin full view. You’re under a hundred guns, gentlemen, and are now our\r\nprisoners. You won’t be harmed, if you do as we say.\r\nThe baggagemaster lets his pistol fall to the railbed, and the two men, as\r\ninstructed, extend their hands as if ready to be manacled and walk forward.\r\nMeanwhile, behind them, up on the platform, a Negro man named Hayward\r\nShepherd, a freedman employed at the station as the night baggageman, has\r\nstepped from the office to the platform to see what is going on, and Phelps, the\r\nconductor—too far from the bridge for him or the clerk or anyone on the train to\r\nsee in the darkness that the engineer and the baggagemaster have been all but\r\ntaken prisoner—orders him to go and assist them in their investigation.\r\nShepherd jumps to the ground and hurries to join the two, who have\r\ndisappeared inside the bridge. When he, too, has neared the entrance and is now\r\nbeyond earshot of the men on the platform, he hears a calm, low voice from the\r\ndarkness, Watson Brown’s, ordering him to stop and listen. Shepherd, a middle-\r\naged bachelor affectionately called “Uncle Hay” by the white citizens of the\r\ntown, stops and listens. In a conversational tone, Watson tells him what Father\r\nhas instructed all of us to say to the Virginia freedmen. We have come from\r\nKansas to free the slaves. You may join us in this enterprise or not.",
    " But if you\r\nrefuse to join us, we will treat with you as with any white man who refuses to\r\njoin us. We will be forced to consider you our enemy.\r\nFor a second, Shepherd hesitates, as if not quite getting Watson’s meaning, and\r\nthen abruptly he turns and runs. Watson—or perhaps it is Stewart Taylor, or\r\nmaybe some other raider, standing in the shadows of the storefronts nearby; any\r\none of us could have done it—fires his rifle, and Shepherd falls, mortally\r\nwounded by a single bullet in the spine, running through to the chest. With\r\neveryone watching him and no one daring to move to help—not Watson or\r\nStewart inside the covered bridge, not their two prisoners, not the several raiders\r\nhiding in the shadows along the street or Father standing unseen at the gate of\r\nthe armory, not the men up on the platform by the station or the passengers\r\nstaring in horror from the windows of the train: no one who sees it can make\r\nhimself come forward to help the fallen man—as Shepherd lifts his bloody chest\r\nfrom the cinders and with his arms slowly drags his numbed, dying body away\r\nfrom the bridge towards the station. After what seems like a long while, he\r\nsucceeds in getting to a protected place below the platform that is close enough\r\nfor Phelps and the hotel clerk safely to reach down and draw him up to it, where\r\nthey quickly pull his body inside the station as if he were already a dead man.\r\nPrepare yourselves for sad ironies, Father forewarned us, often enough for us\r\nto have expected it. But it has come nonetheless as a dismaying shock. Men, the\r\ncruel perversity of slavery will snap back betimes and will try to bite us in our\r\nface, he told us. We have to be hard, hard. This surely is what he meant: that in\r\nthe liberation of the slaves, the first to die may well be neither a white man nor\r\na slave, but a free Negro.",
    "\r\nThis sad event has the immediate good effect, however, of closing down the\r\ntrain and trapping its passengers inside it, with Conductor Phelps and the hotel\r\nclerk retreating to the station, and the guests, those few wakened by this, the\r\nsecond gunshot of the night, holing up inside the hotel. For the time being, the\r\ntown is still ours. A little after four A.M., Aaron Stevens’s party comes clattering\r\ndown Potomac Street, the trap driven by Tidd, with Colonel Washington and Mr.\r\nAllstadt and his son in it, and the farm wagon driven by Cook, with the seven\r\nliberated slaves huddled in back. Stevens, who carries General Washington’s\r\npistol and sword wrapped in a blanket, and the other raiders, Anderson, Leary,\r\nand Green, are on horseback, their mounts taken from Allstadt’s farm.\r\nAs soon as they have arrived at the armory yard, Father tells the newly freed\r\nslaves who he is, Osawatomie Brown of Kansas, which, as he expected, evokes in\r\nthem a certain fearfulness, until he reveals that his principal ally is the famous\r\nNegro Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave himself, and this seems to impress\r\nand calm them somewhat, for these are Virginia ex-slaves and rebellious types,\r\nsurely, or they would not have come in with Stevens and his men, and being\r\nfrom a border town, they no doubt have had secret access to abolitionist\r\ninformation and literature. He places pikes into their hands and stations them\r\ninside the firehouse to guard the growing number of hostages. For now, these\r\nwhite men are your prisoners, he says. Treat them honestly, for they are\r\nhostages, whom we will deploy if we need to bargain for our continued safety,\r\nand as we will be freeing them later, we want them to tell other white people\r\nthe truth about us, that we want not revenge but liberty.",
    "\r\nThe seven Negroes, a woman and six men, several of them barefoot in the cold\r\nnight, take up their pikes and hesitantly, as if they have no choice in the matter,\r\nfollow their former masters into the firehouse, while Father straps on George\r\nWashington’s scabbard and sword and adds to his pair of old service revolvers\r\nthe General’s engraved pistol and tooled leather holster. In all his armament, he\r\nis a formidable sight, a warrior chieftain, and with his Old Testament beard and\r\nfierce gray eyes and his battered straw hat and Yankee farmer’s woolen frock\r\ncoat and his—to the Negroes, to all people, in fact—peculiar way of speaking, he\r\nis a paradoxical one as well: a man out of time, without a shred of vanity or the\r\nslightest regard for convention, and though an old man, he is as overflowing as a\r\nboy with single-minded purpose and high principles, armed and clothed for no\r\nother task in life than this night’s bloody work. The rest of the men, if they put\r\ntheir rifles down, and the ex-slaves, if they put away their pikes, could easily\r\nfold back into the general populace and disappear from sight, here or anywhere\r\nin America; but not Father: he is Osawatomie Brown of Kansas, and no\r\nAmerican, white or black, Northern or Southern, would mistake him for anybody\r\nelse.\r\nAlthough they are far fewer than he expected by now and seem somewhat\r\nconfused and fearful, the arrival of these, the first of the freed slaves, has excited\r\nFather, and he orders Cook to drive one of the wagons over to the Maryland\r\nside, to the schoolhouse where I and my two men, Barclay Coppoc and Frank\r\nMeriam, will have cached the remainder of our arms, one hundred fifty rifles\r\nand another hundred pistols and most of the thousand sharpened pikes. Cook is\r\nto bring one-third of the pikes back into town, for, surely, by morning there will\r\nbe mutinous slaves thronging to the armory yard.",
    " The remainder of the weapons\r\nare for me and my men to distribute first amongst the insurrectionary slaves who\r\ncome in from Maryland, and then we are to carry the remainder up into the\r\nmountains for eventual dispersal there. By daylight, on both sides of the river,\r\nwe will have hundreds of escaped slaves to arm, Father says, and must be ready\r\nfor them in both places, or they will not believe that we are serious.\r\nFor now, until further orders, the raiders who are inside the town are merely\r\nto hold their positions—Kagi and his men, Copeland and now Leary, over at the\r\nrifle factory on Hall’s Island, Oliver and Will Thompson posted at the\r\nShenandoah bridge, Watson and Taylor still holding the bridge across the\r\nPotomac, and Hazlett and Edwin Coppoc guarding the arsenal; the rest of the\r\nmen stand at the ready here at the center of town, in and around the armory\r\ngrounds and the firehouse.\r\nIt is close to six A.M. The rain has ceased, and the heavy storm clouds have\r\nmoved off, and as dawn approaches, the sky turns slowly to a fluttery, gray,\r\nsilken sheet, with the high, wooded ridges in the east and north silhouetted\r\nagainst it. The brick storefronts and houses and offices of the town and the\r\nnarrow, cobbled streets glisten wetly from the night’s rain, and when the first\r\nlight of the rising sun spreads across the eastern horizon, the faces of the\r\nbuildings here below turn pink and seem almost to bloom, as if in the darkness\r\nof the night they existed only in a nascent form, not quite real.",
    "\r\nBefore long, the first of the armory workers, all unsuspecting, come drifting\r\ninto the center of town in twos and threes from their small wood-frame houses\r\nabove the cliffs on Clay Street, and as they walk through the iron gate into the\r\nyard, Father and the others grab them and make them hostages in the firehouse,\r\nuntil he has close to forty men crowded into the two large rooms and has to\r\nstation several of his raiders inside with the freed slaves to help guard them.\r\nThen, by daylight, just as Father said it would, word of the raid gets out. Dr.\r\nJohn Starry, a local physician, is the first to raise the alarm. Summoned to the\r\nhotel hours earlier to care for the wounded watchman and the dying Hayward\r\nShepherd by a courageous Negro barman who, at risk of his life, slipped out a\r\nside door of the hotel and down dark alleyways to the physician’s house, Dr.\r\nStarry bandages the watchman’s forehead and is at Shepherd’s side when the\r\npoor man dies, after which, accompanied by the barman who brought him there,\r\nhe succeeds in returning to his home undetected, where at once he rouses his\r\nfamily and neighbors. Then he rides to the home of the Superintendent of the\r\nArmory, A. M. Kitzmiller, bringing the scarcely-to-be-believed news. The armory,\r\narsenal, and rifle works and a large group of hostages, including Colonel Lewis\r\nWashington, are all in the hands of an army of abolitionist murderers that is led\r\nby none other than Osawatomie Brown and aided by a wild gang of escaped,\r\nspear-carrying slaves! There is a full-scale insurrection under way! Brown has\r\ntrained cannon on the square, the doctor reports, and is moving all the arms\r\nfrom the town into the interior!",
    "\r\nSoon the bell of the Lutheran church atop the hill starts to clang, summoning\r\nthe citizens to an emergency meeting, and a rider has been sent to\r\nShepherdstown to call out the local militia, and a second has been dispatched to\r\nCharles Town for the Jefferson Guards, formed for the express purpose of\r\nmeeting precisely this circumstance after the Turner rebellion back in ’31.\r\nFather and his men, when they hear the church bell ringing on and on for ten,\r\nfifteen, twenty minutes, know what is happening. Don’t be frightened, boys,\r\ndon’t panic. There’s still plenty of time, he assures the men. The hostages and\r\npractically every rifle in the town are in our hands. And the Lord is watching\r\nover us. We won’t go down, boys, but if the Lord requires it of us, then it will be\r\nas Samson went. These people know that, and they don’t want it, so we’re still\r\nsafe enough here.\r\nIt is full daylight, around seven A.M., when Father strides through the gate of\r\nthe armory yard and approaches the railroad station and calls out for Mr. Phelps,\r\nthe conductor. Come here, sir! I wish to parley with you! Phelps pokes his head\r\nout the door but refuses to come forward. I have decided to let you move the\r\ntrain on to Baltimore, Father declares. But tell your employer, and tell all the\r\ncivil and military authorities, that this is the last train I will permit in or out of\r\nHarpers Ferry, at the extreme peril of those men we have taken prisoner, until\r\nwe have finished with our business here.\r\nPhelps nods, and he and the engineer and the baggagemaster return to the\r\ntrain, fire it up, and take it slowly towards the covered bridge and across the\r\nPotomac into Maryland.",
    " From the schoolhouse on the heights opposite, I watch\r\nthe train far below snake its way out of the bridge and wind along the north\r\nbank of the river towards Baltimore and Washington beyond, and I know that\r\nwithin minutes, as soon as the train has reached the station at Monocacy, news\r\nof the raid will reach the main offices of the B & O. An hour later, in Richmond,\r\nan aide to Governor Henry Wise will disturb the Governor’s breakfast with\r\nastonishing news, and shortly afterwards, in Washington, D.C., an adjutant\r\ngeneral will burst into the office of the Secretary of War, who will read the wire\r\nfrom Governor Wise requesting federal troops and will at once ask for an\r\nemergency meeting with President Buchanan. More in line with Father’s\r\npurposes—and I know this, too—by evening, every newspaper in the land will\r\nbe shouting the news of our raid:\r\nFEARFUL AND EXCITING INTELLIGENCE! NEGRO INSURRECTION\r\nIN HARPERS FERRY, VIRGINIA, LED BY JOHN BROWN OF KANSAS!!\r\nMANY SLAIN, HUNDREDS TAKEN HOSTAGE, FEDERAL ARMS SEIZED!!!\r\nIn morning light, a few personal weapons, mostly antiquated muskets and\r\nsquirrel guns, have been located by the townspeople, and five or six of the more\r\nadventurous men among them have taken up firing positions on the hillside\r\nabove the armory yard. It is not long, however, before they are spotted by the\r\nraiders, most of them Kansas veterans and much more experienced than the\r\nlocals at this sort of action and possessing weapons of surpassing accuracy, so\r\nthat the townsmen are barely able to open fire, when one of them, a grocer\r\nnamed Boerly, is shot dead by a bullet from a raider rifle, which causes a quick\r\nretreat amongst the others. It is mid-morning.",
    " The militias from Shepherdstown\r\nand Charles Town have not yet arrived, and in Washington, fifty miles to the\r\neast, federal troops are only now being mustered for railroad transport to\r\nHarpers Ferry. Here in town, their feeble efforts at defense effectively curtailed\r\nby the raiders’ deadly accurate Sharps rifles, by their fear of endangering the\r\nhostages, and by their growing certainty that there are many more than Father’s\r\nseventeen raiders occupying the town and hundreds more escaped slaves than\r\nseven, the citizens are limited to taking occasional, erratic potshots in the\r\ngeneral direction of the armory, causing more danger and havoc to themselves\r\nthan to the raiders.\r\nEven so, over at the rifle works on Hall’s Island, Kagi has grown increasingly\r\nanxious about the passage of so much time, for he and his two men, Copeland\r\nand Leary, though they have so far held the factory uncontested, are situated far\r\nfrom the hostages in the firehouse, and thus, of Father’s force, they are the most\r\nvulnerable to attack from the townsmen. Kagi dispatches Leary to town on foot\r\nto request Father to send back a wagon and additional men, so that they can\r\nquickly load the seized weapons from the factory and begin their escape into the\r\nmountains. It is time. None of the raiders has been killed or even wounded.\r\nAccording to the plan, they should all be departing from Harpers Ferry by now.\r\nAnd I, up on the Maryland Heights, should also have left by now. That is the\r\nplan, Father’s plan, his vision of how it would go at Harpers Ferry on the night\r\nof October 16 and the morning of October 17, and everything up to now has\r\ngone accordingly.",
    " Except for the one thing: that the hundreds of escaping slaves\r\nwhom we expected to come rushing to our side have not yet appeared, and the\r\nfew who have are turning fearful and hesitant and may themselves have to be\r\nput under guard and made into hostages.\r\nBut that does not matter, I decide, as I watch from my perch above the town.\r\nFather’s plan can accommodate that, too. We have seized at least three\r\nwagonloads of weapons, we have terrorized the entire South into believing that\r\nan insurrection has begun, and in the North we have raised fresh huzzahs and\r\nenthusiastic promises of material support and a coming flood of volunteer\r\nfighters—we have, indeed, begun an insurrection, which surely, thanks to the\r\npresence of Frederick Douglass, will catch and burst into flame in a matter of\r\nmere days, and if Father leads his men out of Harpers Ferry now and makes his\r\nappointed rendez-vous in the Alleghenies with Mr. Douglass, we will still be able\r\nto feed those flames and follow them into the deeper South, just as Father\r\nwished. It is not too late.\r\nThe slaves will come in, Father insists. They will soon start to arrive. We must\r\ngive them every moment up to the last possible moment to learn of our raid and\r\nour intentions and to overcome their natural fears and flee their masters’ farms\r\nand plantations for the town, which is still under our control. The second we\r\nabandon the town, the escaping slaves will have no place to go where they are\r\nnot in terrible danger. For their sake, we shall continue to hold the town, he\r\ndeclares. Even as the Jefferson Guards ride in on the Charles Town Pike from the\r\nwest and the Shepherdstown militia comes in along the Potomac road from the\r\nnorth and the troop train from Washington slowly approaches from the east.",
    "\r\nV\r\nChapter 23\r\nBut surely, Miss Mayo, surely you, of all people, must already know the part of\r\nmy account that I am leaving out, and that it turns all I have been relating to\r\nyou these many months into a fantasy, an old man’s wishful dream, and makes\r\nof Father’s exquisitely detailed plan a deadly chimera. For you, like the rest of\r\nAmerica, have read and believed Frederick Douglass’s eloquent narrative of his\r\nlife and are familiar with his version of his final meeting with Father and me in\r\nChambersburg. I have no quarrel with it—what Mr. Douglass says there is true:\r\nthat for an entire day he and Father wrestled like angels, as the one struggled to\r\nkeep the other from martyrdom, and the other fought to convince the one to\r\nsave him from martyrdom by joining him there. And that both men lost the\r\nfight.\r\nIt was a curious, paradoxical situation, for the two loved and admired one\r\nanother past all reasoning, and each, to complete his work, needed the other\r\nalive and at his side. Thanks to the peculiarities of the disease of racialism and\r\nthat all Americans, although differently, suffer from it, Negro as much as white,\r\nthe War Against Slavery could never be won by white or Negro people alone.\r\nMore thoroughly than almost anyone else in the movement, Father and Mr.\r\nDouglass knew this, which caused them both frequently to be criticized by their\r\nracial brethren, the whites disdainful of Father’s close, ongoing alliances with\r\nNegroes and the blacks suspicious of Mr. Douglass’s apparent, privileged ease of\r\nmovement amongst white gentility. Then, as much as now, men like Father and\r\nFrederick Douglass made people of both races, regardless of their politics and\r\nprinciples regarding racial matters, anxious and mistrustful. They were,\r\ntherefore, each other’s main comfort.",
    "\r\nI cannot be exact as to the date, for while the details of everything that\r\nhappened in those days are as vivid and sharply outlined in my memory as in a\r\nstained-glass window, more so than what transpired here in my cabin this very\r\nmorning, the abstractions of duration and chronology are somewhat vague to me\r\nand are often lost altogether from my mind. But one Saturday morning a few\r\nweeks before the raid, Father came to me at breakfast and, taking me aside, said\r\nto hitch the wagon and come up to Chambersburg with him. “I have arranged\r\nfor a meeting there tomorrow morning with Mister Douglass,” he explained.\r\n“Wonderful news,” I answered, genuinely excited at the prospect, although my\r\nhabitual laconic manner probably did not show it. I was often thought in those\r\ndays to be sarcastic or sour, when I was instead merely frightened by the\r\nintensity of my feeling and wished no more than to protect myself and others\r\nfrom it.\r\n“Oh, just do as I say, Owen. He has come all the way from Rochester for this.\r\nHe writes that he wants to hear the details of my plan, but I can only reveal\r\nthem to him in person. And so he has come.”\r\nShortly, we were making our way in late summer sunshine through the rolling,\r\nblond, recently mown pastures and the peaceful farm villages of western\r\nMaryland into Pennsylvania, arriving by evening at our Quaker safe house,\r\nwhere we spent the night talking abolition and religion with the good,\r\npacificistic, prayerful keepers of the house, friends and strong supporters of\r\nabolitionism generally and of Father in particular, people who believed that\r\ntheir friendship and support were being used by us to help establish a more\r\nformidable and effective Underground Railroad, a belief which Father took care\r\nnot to disabuse them of or threaten.",
    "\r\nMostly, I listened, eventually stretching myself out on my blanket by the fire\r\nand finally falling asleep to the sound of Father’s voice droning on into the night,\r\nas he explicated the true meaning in the Book of Matthew of Christ’s ninth-hour\r\ncry on the cross, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? My God, my God, why hast thou\r\nforsaken me? “You must remember, friends, that since the sixth hour there had\r\nbeen darkness all over the land,” he explained. “And the priests had reviled and\r\nmocked Him, saying, If thou be the son of God, then come down from the cross;\r\nand with the scribes and elders, they had all declared, Jesus saved others, but\r\nhimself he cannot save. And then they said to Him, If you be the king of Israel,\r\nthe true Son of God, then come down from the cross, and we will believe you.\r\nWhereupon Christ cried out, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me? and\r\nyielded up the ghost, so as to provide for all those who had mocked and reviled\r\nHim, even those who had crucified Him, both the question and the answer. For\r\nwhen He had yielded up the ghost, as all men must, the veil of the temple was\r\nrent, and the earth quaked and split, and the graves were opened, and many\r\nbodies of the saints that slept therein arose, and when the people saw that, all of\r\nthem, even the Roman centurions who stood amongst the priests and scribes and\r\nelders, were struck with fear, and they said, Truly, this was the Son of God! Eli,\r\nEli, lama sabachthani’. Out of the pitch darkness came that most human cry of\r\nHim who believes in God, of Him who knows that He is the most beloved of\r\nGod, of Him who is yet subject utterly to God’s will.",
    " And thus, in asking His final\r\nquestion—which is not a self-serving plea such as we ourselves, like the priests\r\nand the scribes and the elders, might make, but a question that is asked by a\r\nchild of its parent, by a son of his father, by one who does not doubt the\r\nexistence of the other and does not question the power of the other—in asking\r\nthat question, Why hast Thou forsaken me? Christ in His final act amongst men\r\nis truly exemplary. Which is exactly and most particularly how the Lord\r\nintended Him to be for us, as a gift, His greatest gift, a gift exceeding even life\r\nitself, a gift that defines for us the possibility of eternal life, and in the way that\r\nit is revealed to us, we are shown the sole means for obtaining it. Belief in the\r\nLord, not special pleading, but belief, simple belief, as the child believes in the\r\nparent . . .”\r\nThus, as so often, was my descent into sleep contaminated and controlled by\r\nmy father’s words and my dreams shaped by them, so that, to the degree that\r\none’s waking mind is sculpted by the artistry of one’s dreams, I was, the\r\nfollowing day, when we rode out to the quarry where Father had arranged to\r\nmeet with Mr. Douglass, locked into considerations, not of the question of the\r\nefficacy of martyrdom, but of its ultimate meaning, of its use as proof of belief.\r\nFor I had come to see that it need have no practical purpose, that it required no\r\nparticular objective or goal in this world, to be justified or desired. Its purpose\r\nwas to strengthen belief, the martyr’s belief in God the Father, in the Hereafter,\r\nin eternal life, in resurrection—in something, anything, other than the meaning\r\nand purpose here and now of the mortal life of the martyr himself.\r\nBy mid-morning, after much careful reconnoitering, we had taken up our\r\nposition like watchful ravens at the quarry where Mr.",
    " Douglass in his narrative\r\nsays that he finally found us—upon a cut-stone platform walled in and set high\r\namongst slabs of gray rock from which we could obtain a good view of anyone\r\napproaching us without being seen ourselves. Father was still a fugitive then,\r\nwith a federal price on his head, and I imagine that I was, too, although, so far\r\nfrom Kansas and with no one any longer actively pursuing us, it was easy to\r\nforget. But it was also true that, this early in the game and this late, it would be\r\nreckless for the Old Man to be seen meeting with Frederick Douglass so close to\r\nthe border of a slave state. And, of course, Father enjoyed the accoutrements of\r\nclandestinity for their own sake. Thus we hid ourselves up amongst the rocks\r\nfrom Mr. Douglass and made him find us.\r\nAnd eventually, after considerable trouble, which we watched from above, he\r\ndid. He came clambering over sharp-edged layers of granite with a companion, a\r\nbalding, large-eyed Negro man of early middle years and athletic build. Mr.\r\nDouglass, as always, was dressed in a fine woolen suit and wore a black cravat\r\nand brimmed hat; his companion was in a workingman’s blouse and pants and\r\nboots, with a tattered old straw on his head; and the two were puffing and wet\r\nwith sweat when they suddenly came around a granite pylon and encountered us\r\n—no doubt unexpectedly, for they had by then probably begun to believe that\r\nwe had been delayed or that they had misunderstood Father’s directions to the\r\nquarry or perhaps had gone to the wrong place in it.\r\n“Ah, Brown, here you are!” Mr. Douglass exclaimed, much relieved. He smiled,\r\nand the two men shook hands warmly and embraced.\r\nFather began at once to speak of the purpose of the meeting, but Mr.",
    " Douglass\r\ninterrupted him and elaborately introduced his friend Shields Green, who he said\r\nwas very interested in meeting the famous Osawatomie Brown and possibly in\r\n“joining him down here in the fray,” as he put it. Then he greeted me with a\r\nsmile and handshake and gave Father to understand that he and Mr. Green\r\nneeded to catch their breath for a moment or two. He was sorry, he said, that he\r\nhad not brought water or refreshment with him.\r\nIt was impossible not to honor Frederick Douglass. His handsome presence was\r\ncommanding without ever seeming pompous or condescending, and he was\r\ngregarious and gracious without a taint of servility. He made you feel that you\r\nand he were equals on a very high plane. And he was the only man I ever saw\r\nsilence Father good-naturedly.\r\nHe leaned against the rock wall of our aerie and fanned his dark, bearded face\r\nwith his hat-brim, while Shields Green sat and rested upon a table-sized stone\r\nnearby and wiped down his neck and face with a large blue handkerchief.\r\nFinally, Mr. Douglass said to Father, “All right, Old John, let me hear it. There\r\nare some wild rumors circulating up North about you and your boys, and I need\r\nto know the truth of the matter. I’ll tell you, friend, some of your strongest\r\nsupporters and allies are afraid that you’re about to commence some wild,\r\nfoolhardy action down here, and I’d like to go home and tell them otherwise.”\r\n“There’s nothing wild or foolhardy about my plans, except to men who lack\r\ncourage and principles,” Father began, and here he commenced the recitation\r\nwith which I and the others hidden back at the attic of the Kennedy farmhouse\r\nhad become so familiar that we could recite it word by word ourselves. He told\r\nMr.",
    " Douglass how the old plan had been modified to such a degree that it\r\namounted now to a new plan, and, just as with us, he brought out and unrolled\r\nhis maps and went over each step of the raid, until he had got to the end of the\r\nraid and our rendez-vous in the wilderness with Frederick Douglass and the\r\nhundreds, perhaps thousands, of newly liberated slaves.\r\nMr. Douglass was silent for a few moments and studied the maps with pursed\r\nlips and furrowed brow. At last, he sighed and said, “I love you, John Brown. I\r\ndo. You’ve been a true hero, and I don’t want you killed. You and those brave\r\nyoung men with you.”\r\n“We may suffer losses” Father said, interrupting. “It’s inevitable in war. But we\r\nwill triumph over our enemies in the end. We will. I know it, Frederick. The\r\nLord will protect us.”\r\n“The Lord can’t protect you from the nature of that place, Harpers Ferry. It’s a\r\nsteel trap, John. You’ll get in and not be able to get out. Please, forget this.”\r\n“Our hostages will shield us while we’re down there, and the wilderness and\r\nthe mountains will preserve us when we’ve left.”\r\n“No, no, no, no! Impossible! Remember, I know these white Southerners; you\r\ndon’t. These men will cut down every tree from here to Tennessee but one, and\r\nwhen they have caught you, they’ll hang you from it. And along the way, they’ll\r\nbutcher any slave who even dreams of rebellion in his sleep.”\r\n“We’ll be too many too soon for them to go against us, and we’ll be\r\neverywhere across the South, so they’ll never be able to unite against us in any\r\none place. This is no conventional war I’m fomenting here, Frederick.”\r\n“The federal army, John. Remember that.”\r\n“Yes, and remember the Seminoles. The Alleghenies will be my Everglades.”\r\n“And our Negroes, are they to be your Indian warriors?”\r\n“If you will lead them with me.",
    " If you are at my side, they will rise up and\r\nfollow me into battle against their white masters.” Then for a long while Father\r\nexplained how their army of escaped slaves would be divided into two parts, one\r\nto conduct raids on the plantations and towns of the South, the other to provide\r\nlogistical support for the raiders and safe transportation out of the South for\r\nthose escaping slaves who, because of age or infirmity or temperament, were\r\nunable to join the battle or merely wished to flee into the North. It all seemed so\r\nlogical and so likely to succeed that Mr. Douglass’s persistent objections and\r\nskepticism began to look, to me, like a reflection of his character more than his\r\nmind, as if a fearful heart had shut down his brain.\r\nBack and forth they went, first one arguing his case, then the other, like\r\nattorneys pleading before a stern, inscrutable judge. Who was right, Father or\r\nFrederick Douglass? Not in hindsight, but at the moment of their argument. In\r\nhindsight, Mr. Douglass obviously seems to have been right. But back then,\r\nbefore the raid, was not Father right to believe that if Mr. Douglass made the\r\nraid on Harpers Ferry the opening act of a slave rebellion led by him and Old\r\nJohn Brown together, then it almost had to be a successful rebellion?\r\n“With you at my side, this enterprise will be larger than any previous event in\r\nAmerican history. It will be a true revolution, the revolution we should have\r\nfought back in ’76!”\r\n“No, Brown, it won’t. It’ll be suicidal. Worse than Nat Turner. With or without\r\nme, it’s destined to fail. We are too few, too poorly armed, too ill-equipped, and\r\ntoo untrained as soldiers to accomplish what you have imagined.”\r\nFather stepped away and stared down at the large, open pit of the quarry\r\nbelow. In a low, sulky voice, he said, “I’m glad you weren’t around to advise our\r\nRevolutionary forebears, Frederick.",
    " We’d all still be British subjects.”\r\nMr. Douglass smiled. “Yes, well, given the fact that the British have outlawed\r\nslavery for close to a quarter-century now, it might not be a bad thing to be a\r\nBritish subject.”\r\nFor many hours, long into the afternoon, the two men went back and forth,\r\nfirst one making his argument, citing precedent and pointing to principle for\r\nsupport, and then the other. Shields Green and I listened first to one, then to the\r\nother, and said nothing: we were like children listening to their parents argue\r\nover a matter that, for good or evil, would shape all their lives to come and\r\nwishing that both parents could be right. Mr.",
    " Douglass would speak for a while,\r\nmarshaling his arguments with care and generosity towards Father, with\r\nsympathetic understanding of the Old Man’s objectives and firm disapproval of\r\nhis means, not on principle but for practical reasons only; and Shields and I\r\nwould nod, as if thinking, yes, Harpers Ferry is a steel trap, we will get in and\r\nnever be able to get out, and if by some miracle we do fight our way through the\r\noutraged townspeople and avoid being cut to pieces by the local militiamen as\r\nwe flee the Shenandoah Valley into the wilderness, then, yes, the federal army\r\nwill be arrayed against us and will in a short while cut us off in our mountain\r\nretreat and will lay down a siege from which our only escape will be death by\r\nstarvation or a bullet, and, yes, our raid and the mere threat of the slave\r\nrebellion it poses will bring down upon the head of every Negro in the South\r\nuntold suffering, lynchings, mutilations, chains, for the worst sort of oppression\r\nimaginable would be the inevitable consequence of raising fear of a slave revolt\r\nin the hearts of white Southerners, and, yes, the Northern whites will not come\r\nto our aid, for they will never go to war against their white brethren in the\r\ndefense of black people and a handful of white radical abolitionists: it is an\r\nabsurd plan, absurd, and cruel beyond belief.",
    "\r\nThen, as the sun passed overhead and moved towards the western\r\nPennsylvania hills, and the shadows of the rock that surrounded us grew long,\r\nFather would commence to answer, and now Shields and I nodded in support of\r\nhis reasoning, too, saying to ourselves, yes, we can take the town by surprise and\r\nhold it by means of hostages long enough to capture sufficient weaponry to arm\r\nthe hundreds, perhaps thousands, of slaves who will surely seize the opportunity\r\nto rise against their masters, once they know they are being led by men they\r\ntrust as warriors and as men of principle, and, yes, we can flee to safety in the\r\ndensely forested mountains of the South, and with a hundred bands of\r\ndisciplined, well-armed, guerilla fighters we can hold off any army for months,\r\neven years, during which time our ranks will swell to such numbers that the\r\nSouthern states, just to restore their economy, will make peace with their\r\nworkers, for is that not, after all, who has gone to war against them, their\r\nworkers?\r\n“In the end, Frederick, it’s right principles and simple economics that will\r\nsettle this thing in our favor,” Father said, and I could not disagree.\r\nUntil Mr. Douglass, in his low, melodious, melancholy voice, answered, “No,\r\nJohn. It’s race that will settle it. And it will settle it against us. Race and simple\r\narithmetic. Not principles and not economics. Simply put, there are more of you\r\nin this country than of us. This is not Haiti or Jamaica, and the northern United\r\nStates are not a separate nation than the southern United States. It’s race, John.\r\nSkin color and hair and physiognomy. You say us, John, and you mean all\r\nAmericans willing to go to war to end slavery. But every other American who says\r\nus means race, means us white people, or us Negroes. You are a noble, good man.\r\nBut you are nearly alone in this country.",
    " Even me, when I say us, I mean we\r\nNegroes.”\r\n“Then you will not join me.”\r\n“John, I cannot. My practical judgement forbids it. My conscience forbids it.\r\nMy love of my people forbids it.”\r\n“You are making my task all the more difficult. Without you beside me ... my\r\nboys, my men ...” He stopped and could not speak for a moment. “Without you,”\r\nhe continued, “the slaves won’t rise up and follow me in such numbers. ...”\r\nMr. Douglass placed his heavy hands onto Father’s narrow shoulders and\r\nlooked into the Old Man’s eyes, and I thought that both men would weep, for\r\ntheir eyes were full. “Please, come away from this. Come back with me, John.\r\nLet your son here return to Virginia by himself and send your men home. Fight\r\nthis war on another front.”\r\n“This is the only front left to me.”\r\nMr. Douglass turned away and said to Shields Green, “I shall return home to\r\nRochester. If you wish, you may go back with me, or you may stay. You’ve heard\r\nall the arguments as well as I.”\r\nShields looked at the ground and said nothing.\r\nFather reached out and touched Mr. Douglass’s sleeve and, in a soft, plaintive\r\nvoice, almost a whisper, said, “When I strike, the bees will begin to swarm, and I\r\nwill need you to help hive them.” It was a trope that he had used many times,\r\nand he spoke it mechanically, as if his thoughts, as if he himself, were elsewhere\r\nnow.\r\nMr. Douglass did not answer. He looked again at Shields Green and said,\r\n“What have you decided to do?“\r\nShields turned his face, not to Mr. Douglass, but to Father, and he replied, “I\r\nbelieve I’ll go with the Old Man.”\r\nMr. Douglass nodded and slowly shook hands with us one by one, and when\r\nhe had finished, he embraced us each in a heartfelt way one by one, as if it were\r\nhe who was going to war and not we, and then he departed from us straightway\r\nfor his home in Rochester.",
    " That same night, Father, Shields Green, and I\r\nreturned in the wagon to Virginia.\r\nChapter 24\r\nThis morning I woke in the dark, and my cabin was cold as a grave, and my\r\nheart leapt up when I thought again that I had died in the night and had joined\r\nFather and the others in purgatory. But then the chalky light of dawn drifted\r\nthrough the window like a fog and erased the comforting clarity of darkness, and\r\nI saw where I was, crumpled under my filthy blanket in a corner—a scrawny old\r\nman with matted beard and hair lying in his dirty underclothes in an unheated,\r\nbare room, my shelves, cot, chair, and tabletop covered with paper spilling onto\r\nthe floor. I saw that I am nothing but paper. My life has finally come to only\r\nthis: a tiny bubble of consciousness surrounded by thousands of sheets and\r\nscraps of paper—these dozens of tablets filled with disordered scribblings and all\r\nthe letters and notebooks and documents and yellowed newspaper clippings and\r\ntattered old books and periodicals that I so long ago promised to deliver over to\r\nyou, a great, disheveled heap of words, an incoherent jumble and snarl of truths,\r\nlies, memories, fantasies, and even recipes and lists, some of the words as\r\nmundane as a description of the several grades of wool in 1848, others as lofty\r\nas philosophical speculations on the nature of true religion and heroism, words\r\ntaken from the floor of the marketplace to Emerson’s brain, but all of it, all these\r\nwords, adding up to ... what? To nothing worth anything to anyone but me, I\r\nsuppose, and worth nothing to me; so why have I collected and saved it all these\r\nyears?\r\nI’m struggling to think clearly.",
    " Why did I pack and carry Father’s letters sent\r\nand received and his pocket notes and the many ledgers and books, an entire\r\nwooden crate of them, away out here to my California mountaintop and keep\r\nthem here beside me these many years? I added to them over the years, as\r\nbooks, articles, and memoirs were published, and now, in feeble old age, I have\r\nbeen adding to the pile still more paper, more useless truths and speculation.\r\nWhy have I done this?\r\nI know that I began with the belief that I would compose a relation of my\r\nmemories and knowledge of my father and that I would send it to you and\r\nProfessor Villard, along with all the documents that I collected and kept over the\r\nyears—for your purposes, for the composition of what you properly hope will be\r\nthe defining biography of John Brown, a great book, no doubt, scheduled to\r\nmake its public appearance in auspicious conjunction with the fiftieth-\r\nanniversary celebration of the raid on Harpers Ferry and my father’s capture by\r\nthe federal army and his execution by the government of Virginia. But, surely,\r\nthis long after I first began, that memorial year has come and passed us by.",
    " And\r\nyet here I sit, still scribbling, writing now in the margins of my long-filled tablets\r\nand on the backs of Father’s letters and in his notebooks, even in the margins\r\nand blank end-pages of his broken-backed personal books, his Flint’s Survey, his\r\nJonathan Edwards, Milton, and Franklin, his own published writings, too,\r\n“Sambo’s Mistakes” and the Provisional Constitution, old copies of The Liberator,\r\nscrolled maps of the Subterranean Passway, newspaper accounts of the raid and\r\nof Father’s final words on the scaffold, and Redpath’s and Higginson’s and\r\nHinton’s and Sanborn’s biographies and memoirs—each day that passes, I write a\r\nfew new sentences, sometimes only one, and sometimes, when my heart beats\r\nfast with feeling and my vision of the past is sharp and bright, as many as a\r\nhundred.\r\nBut I have long since given up any hope of ordering these pages and sending\r\nthem to you. I write now only so that I can someday cease to write. I speak in\r\norder to go silent. And I listen to my voice so that I will soon no longer be\r\nobliged to hear it.\r\nThat fateful October night at the Kennedy farmhouse, after Father and the others\r\nhad departed for the town, I spent a good while gathering and heaping\r\neverything together on the floor in front of the stove, and when I stood and\r\nstared down at the mass of incrimination, it was like listening to a thousand low,\r\nchoked confessions all at once, as if the voices, mingling and merging with one\r\nanother, were the sad, accumulated results of a long, unforgiving Inquisition into\r\nthe heresy and betrayal of their Puritan fathers by an entire generation of sons. I\r\nburned none of it. My heretical refusal to play Isaac to my father’s Abraham\r\nseemed not mine alone: it felt emblematic to me—as if an Age of Heroism had\r\nacceded to an Age of Cowardice.",
    " As if, in the context of those last days at\r\nHarpers Ferry and the one great moral issue of our time, I had become a man of\r\nanother time: a man of the future, I suppose. A modern man.\r\nStepping back from the cold stove, I set my candle on the table and blew it\r\nout, dropping the house into darkness. Then I went into the rain and crossed the\r\nstubbled field to the shed, where Barclay Coppoc and Frank Meriam had finished\r\nloading the weapons onto the wagon. Coppoc was seated up on the box with the\r\nreins in his hands, scowling impatiently at me, while Meriam sat ashen-faced\r\nbehind him.\r\n“You finally done in there?” Coppoc said.\r\n“Yes.”\r\n“Well, then, let’s get a move on. The Old Man must already be across the\r\nbridge. Me and Frank heard gunfire a minute ago.”\r\n“Fine,” I said, and climbed onto the wagon, taking a place on the wooden\r\ncases next to Meriam. Coppoc clucked to the horse, Adelphi, the second of our\r\nold North Elba pair of Morgans, and we moved slowly away from the Kennedy\r\nfarm onto the wet, rumpled road and headed gradually downhill towards the\r\nabandoned schoolhouse overlooking the river and the town below. By the time\r\nwe reached our destination, we could hear guns firing below, intermittently and\r\nfrom several different places—from near the armory, we thought, then from the\r\nMaryland side of the bridge, and a little later from the factory at the further edge\r\nof town. As instructed by Father, we quickly unloaded the weapons from the\r\nwagon and stacked the unopened cases along the walls inside the one room of\r\nthe schoolhouse.\r\nAbout an hour before daylight, when the rain let up, we went outside and\r\nwalked through the woods a short ways to the edge of a cliff high above the\r\nPotomac, and stood together there, looking down in the hazy, pre-dawn light.\r\nBehind us, still hitched to the empty wagon, the horse browsed peacefully on a\r\nblond patch of grass.",
    " The sky was smeared gray beyond the far, dark bluffs, and\r\nin the town below, a few lights dully shone from the windows of the hotel and\r\nfirehouse. We could see the train where it had stopped on the siding next to the\r\nrailroad station and a few dark figures standing on the platform. Coppoc said he\r\ncould make out some of our boys and a couple of Negroes posted inside the\r\narmory walls by the firehouse, where the hostages were supposed to be kept, but\r\nI couldn’t distinguish them from this distance.\r\nSuddenly, Meriam, who had been strangely silent, blurted in his nervous, high-\r\npitched voice, “Owen, where are the slaves? There should be hundreds of\r\nescaped slaves coming to us by now, right? Isn’t that right, Owen? We’ve got all\r\nthese damned pikes and guns and no one to give them to!” He laughed edgily.\r\n“Shut up, Frank,” Coppoc said. “They’ll come in. And it’s all right if they don’t.\r\nOr if only a few make it here tonight. They’ll catch up with us later in the\r\nmountains. We’ll arm them then.”\r\n“No, Barclay,” I said. “They won’t.”\r\n“How’s that?”\r\n“They’re not coming. Not now. Not ever.”\r\nThe two looked at me angrily. ’Course they’re coming in,” Coppoc said. “Good\r\nLord, Owen, this is way beyond arguing now. We’ve got options anyhow.”\r\n“Yes, and we got of Fred Douglass a-waiting in the wings,” said Meriam.\r\n“No, we don’t.”\r\n“Now, come on, Owen, what’re you talking about?” Meriam demanded, his\r\nvoice rising. “We got options. Plenty of’em. You heard the Old Man, same as us.”\r\n“Say it, Owen.”\r\nAnd so I said it. “Boys, Frederick Douglass is in Rochester, New York, tonight,\r\nasleep in his bed. I know that, and Shields Green knows it, and Father knows it.\r\nWe lied to you,” I said. “At least, I did. Father and Shields, I think, lied to\r\nthemselves and each other and believed their lies, and so they told you only\r\nwhat they thought was the truth.",
    "” Then in a few sentences I revealed to Meriam\r\nand Coppoc what had happened at the quarry in Chambersburg and how later,\r\nriding back down to Virginia, Father had insisted that, once Mr. Douglass\r\nrealized we were deadly serious, he would change his mind. Maybe he would\r\nwait until the raid had actually begun, but in the end Mr. Douglass would fly to\r\nour side, for he was a man of deep principle and great personal courage. Father\r\nwas sure of it. And Shields had agreed, in a way that made it seem that his\r\nfriend Mr. Douglass had given him some private assurances.\r\nFather instructed us not to report to the other men what had been said at the\r\nquarry. “It will only make them unnecessarily fearful and will sow disunity\r\namongst them,” he said.\r\nAnd we obeyed—Shields because he believed that my father knew things that\r\nno other man knew, and I because I was his son. “Shields thinks Osawatomie\r\nBrown is a prophet,” I said.\r\n“And I take it you don’t,” Coppoc said, disgusted.\r\n“No.”\r\n“For God’s sake, none of that matters now! What’re we going to do?” Meriam\r\ncried.\r\n“My brother Ed’s down there!’ said Coppoc.\r\n“And two of mine. And two brothers-in-law. And a father.”\r\n“Owen Brown, what kind of man are you?” Coppoc said, and turned away\r\nfrom me.\r\nWe heard more gunshots then, rifle shots, coming from the vicinity of the\r\nchurch a short ways above the armory and overlooking it. Some townspeople\r\nwere running and ducking behind walls, and it looked like they were taking\r\npotshots at our men in the armory yard below. Then our men returned fire, and\r\none of the townspeople went down. The others quickly grabbed up his body and\r\npulled it behind a shed, and the guns went silent for a while.",
    "\r\nMeriam was frantic by now, confused by the war between his mortal fear,\r\nwhich made him want to flee, and his long-held desire to become the man whose\r\nsacrificial death would save the others, and he careened amongst the trees like a\r\nblind man, while Coppoc stared coldly from the cliff to the town. “You should\r\nhave kept them from going in,” he said finally. “You should have told us the\r\ntruth.”\r\n“That wouldn’t have kept Father out. Nothing would. He’d have gone alone, if\r\nnecessary. You know that. And there’d always have been some of the men to\r\nfollow him. Maybe not Kagi, maybe not Cook or you. But your brother would.\r\nAnd mine, Watson and Oliver, and the Thompsons, some of the others. Those\r\nboys would follow the Old Man straight through the gates of hell. You know it as\r\nwell as I. No, it’s better they all went in together, not just five or six of them.\r\nEven me, if Father had not posted me on this side of the river, I’d have gone in,\r\ntoo. Twenty men have a better chance of getting out than five or six.”\r\n“Maybe. But only if they leave that place now!’ Coppoc replied, and then he\r\ndeclared that he was going over. He would tell them the truth of the matter\r\nhimself. “To let them know their real situation,” he said. He called Meriarn to\r\nhim, calmed him somewhat, and asked him to go down into the town with him.\r\nCoppoc explained that they could get across the bridge all right, as it was still\r\nevidently under Father’s control, and if they hurried and got across before full\r\ndaylight, they could sneak unseen into the armory yard and help the Old Man\r\nand the boys fight their way out.\r\nMeriam agreed at once. Coppoc had resolved his dilemma. “It’s how I knew it\r\nwould happen,” he said. “I foresaw it, and now it’s the Lord’s will running\r\nthings, not mine. It’s how it has to be. So I must go with you, Barclay.”\r\n“What about you, Owen?",
    "”\r\n“Father said to wait here for the Negroes. You two ought to do the same. He\r\nordered us to arm the slaves when they came here and to meet up with him and\r\nthe others later in Cumberland.”\r\n“Well, now, that’s done with, isn’t it? Countermand the Old Man’s order, for\r\nheaven’s sake! You got the right. You’re in command up here.”\r\n“My father does not want me to save him,” I said.\r\n“Seems to me that’s the only order you’re following. Back at the house there,\r\nwhen we loaded the wagon, I never smelled chimney smoke. You didn’t burn\r\nthose papers like he said to, did you, Owen?”\r\n“I needed more time. There was more material than I thought, books and so\r\non. I’ll go back and destroy them later. Or carry them away,” I added.\r\n“So, Owen Brown, it’s over. And you’ve single-handedly done the whole thing\r\nin. Amazing.” Coppoc shook his head in weary resignation. “Well, what about it,\r\nare you coming with me and Frank?”\r\n“No.”\r\n“You don’t intend to try stopping us, do you?” he said, and he leveled his rifle\r\nat me.\r\n“My orders are to stand fast, unless he sends for us. And if you go down there\r\nwith what I’ve told you, Barclay, all you’ll do is sow disunity amongst the men,”\r\nI said. “Father was right about that much. One by one, they’ll sneak off and run,\r\nand not a one will come out of that place alive unless every one of them believes\r\nhe’s fighting for more than just to save his own life. Those are brave men,\r\nBarclay, and they still have a chance, but this news will make cowards of them\r\nall.”\r\n“You sound like the Old Man. All theory. You ready, Frank?” Meriam nodded\r\nsolemnly, and they slowly backed away from me, with Coppoc still keeping me\r\nunder his gun, although I had no intentions of trying to force them to stay. It\r\nwas too late. They were already doing exactly what I feared the others would do,\r\ncutting away from Father and running for their lives.",
    " I knew that Coppoc and\r\nMeriam would never make it into town, that before they reached the bridge they\r\nwould realize the extremity of their situation and would disappear into the\r\nVirginia woods, and that eventually they would be hunted down out there and\r\nshot dead or else hog-tied and brought in to be hung.\r\nThe dawn wind blew through the leaves overhead. Then I heard the train\r\nlocomotive hissing and blowing steam below and turned my gaze back to the\r\ntown. Slowly, the train pulled out of the station and entered the bridge. A\r\nminute later, it reappeared on the other, the near, bank of the river, where it\r\nbore away to the east, curling along the broadening valley of the Potomac,\r\ncarrying to the nation the fearful and exciting intelligence of the Negro\r\ninsurrection raised this October night by Old John Brown and his men at\r\nHarpers Ferry.\r\nIt was nearly full daylight, and the tall oaks stood around me like sentries. For\r\na long while, as if I could not, I did not move. I was alone, as alone as I had ever\r\nbeen in my life. But strangely—all unexpectedly—free. As if, after a lifetime\r\nbound to my father’s fierce will and companionship by heavy steel manacles and\r\nchains, I had watched them come suddenly unlocked, and I had simply, almost\r\ncasually, pitched them aside.\r\nBut were my actions from then on those of a free man? I cannot say. To be sure,\r\nI followed no impulses but my own.",
    " It sounds ridiculous now as I write it, but\r\nwhen Coppoc and Meriam had been gone awhile, I climbed the branches of the\r\ntallest oak tree up there on the cliff, climbed to the topmost branch that would\r\nsafely support my weight, and, with my Sharps rifle in my lap, made for myself a\r\nsort of crow’s nest from which I could see clearly the streets and buildings of\r\nHarpers Ferry—from the rifle factory at the further, southern end of town, where\r\nKagi, Leary, and Copeland were pinned down by local riflemen, to the Maryland\r\nside of the B & O bridge, where Oliver, Will Thompson, and Dangerfield Newby\r\nwere posted. I could also see along the remaining length of the high ridge of\r\nBolivar Heights, down to where the road from the Kennedy farmhouse emerged\r\nfrom the woods and crossed the canal to the tow path. And I could look directly\r\ninto the armory yard itself, where Father and most of his raiders had positioned\r\nthemselves behind the high, iron-rail walls and cut-stone pylons and inside the\r\nfirehouse with the hostages.\r\nAll was still and silent down there, until, from my watchtower, I saw Father\r\nwalk out of the firehouse with a man I did not recognize and appear to send him\r\nfrom the armory across the open square to the hotel. After a time, the man\r\nreturned, carrying a large, open carton of what must have been food—breakfast\r\nfor the hostages and the raiders both, I assumed. Again, all was calm for a while,\r\nuntil around midmorning, when movement and the sound of men and horses\r\nbelow me and to my right drew my attention away from the town. A large party\r\nof armed white civilians under the flag of the notorious Jefferson Guards was\r\nriding in from the west along the tow path.\r\nAt a point very close to the Maryland end of the B & O bridge, they spotted\r\nOliver and Will Thompson and Dangerfield Newby, dismounted, and at once\r\nbegan firing at them.",
    " The three raiders took shelter behind the toll house and\r\nreturned fire, but the fusillade from the militiamen drove them steadily\r\nbackwards towards the bridge, where I saw Newby at the entrance suddenly fall\r\ndown dead, slain by what appeared to be a long spike or a bolt shot from a\r\nsmooth-bore musket that tore through him ear-to-ear at the throat. Dangerfield\r\nNewby—the mulatto slave-son of a Scotchman from Fairfax County, Virginia—\r\nwas forty-four and the oldest, after Father, of the raiders. He had joined us early\r\non, with the main intention of freeing his wife and children, who were slaves of\r\na man in Warrenton, Virginia. A tall man of light color, well over six feet, and a\r\nsplendid physical specimen, he was a melancholy man, a good man, and my\r\nfriend. And now he lay dead—the first of the raiders to go down—while Oliver\r\nand Will Thompson fled to safety in the firehouse.\r\nSoon after this, another detachment of armed civilians led by a man in\r\nuniform, a second militia force, I supposed, came riding into town from the\r\nsouthwest along Shendandoah Street, where they swiftly secured the\r\nShenandoah bridge and took up positions behind the arsenal, thus commanding\r\nthe town square and the front of the armory yard. Their position, combined with\r\nthat of the Jefferson Guards at the B & O bridge, effectively shut off the only\r\nescape routes left to Father and his men. They also made it impossible for\r\nBarclay Coppoc and Frank Meriam or anyone else to slip in from the Maryland\r\nside and help rescue them. Except for Kagi and his men out at the rifle works,\r\nFather and his Provisional Army were now trapped with their hostages in the\r\narmory yard and firehouse.\r\nIn about an hour, a pair of men—one of whom I did not know and figured was\r\na hostage, the other being Will Thompson, my brother-inlaw—emerged from the\r\nfirehouse bearing a white flag, the signal to parley.",
    " There was by now an\r\nemboldened crowd of armed townspeople in the square and on the porch of the\r\nhotel and the platform of the railroad station, and when they saw the two men\r\ncome forward from the firehouse, the crowd rushed them and seized and beat\r\nWill, dragging him into the hotel. The other man they made much of and\r\nslapped him on the shoulders and offered him pulls from their bottles, for many\r\nof them were by now freely drinking.\r\nA few moments later, my brother Watson and the dark-browed Aaron Stevens\r\nand a third man, another hostage, I assumed, came out of the firehouse and\r\nwalked into the cobbled square with a white flag. Suddenly, there was a barrage\r\nof gunfire from the crowd, and Watson fell, and Stevens fell, both bleeding from\r\nthe face and torso. The hostage ran towards the crowd, but Watson pulled\r\nhimself to his knees and dragged his gut-shot body back inside the armory\r\ngrounds to the safety of the firehouse. Stevens lay writhing in pain, shot four or\r\nmore times and unable to lift himself from the pavement, when, strange to see,\r\none of the hostages came out of the firehouse, picked him up, and lugged him\r\nacross the square and into the hotel. Shortly afterwards, the same man walked\r\nfrom the hotel and returned to the firehouse, a hostage again, but choosing it\r\nthis time, which made me think that Father must be close to surrendering, if for\r\nno other reason than to get medical attention for Watson, who had looked to be\r\nseriously wounded.\r\nMore time passed, while the crowd at the hotel and railroad station and in the\r\ntown square grew larger by the minute and more courageous and raucous with\r\ndrink and rage, when I spotted a man climbing from the rear window of the\r\nfirehouse into the armory yard.",
    " It was not a hostage escaping, I suddenly\r\nrealized, it was young Willie Leeman, our wild and pretty boy from Maine,\r\nskittering across the yard away from the front gate to the rear. A slender lad,\r\nbarely twenty years old, he slipped between the bars of the wall, dashed across\r\nthe railroad tracks, and made for the Potomac. I was not surprised to see him\r\nabandon the others. He had come up the hard way—Poor Willie, we called him.\r\nSent to work in a Haverhill shoe factory at fourteen, he had run off at seventeen\r\nto join Father’s volunteers in Kansas, where he had been difficult for us to\r\ncontrol, a lonely, uneducated boy who liked his drink and when drunk shouted\r\nhis principles to anyone who would listen.\r\nJust as he reached the river, which ran fairly shallow there, and waded in,\r\nsomeone in the crowd spotted him, and a batch of men up on the railroad station\r\nplatform commenced firing at him, while he swam frantically for the Maryland\r\nside. With bullets splashing all around, he managed to get no more than fifty feet\r\nfrom shore before he was hit. Unable to swim any further, he turned back and\r\nhauled himself onto a tiny mudflat and collapsed. Several men ran along the\r\ntracks and down to the shore, and one of them waded out to the islet where\r\nWillie lay bleeding, put his revolver to the boy’s head, and shot him dead. The\r\nman returned to his comrades and they raced back to the station platform and\r\njoined the crowd, making from there a target of Willie’s body, shooting into it\r\nover and over, as if it were a sack of wet grain.\r\nBy midday, the youngest of the raiders, Will Leeman, was dead; and the oldest,\r\nDangerfield Newby. Inside the firehouse, and inside the hotel across the way, my\r\nbrother Watson and Aaron Stevens lay wounded, perhaps mortally, and my\r\nbrother-in-law Will Thompson, brutally beaten, sat in the hotel under armed\r\nguard.",
    " I was sure that Barclay Coppoc and Frank Meriam had by now fled into\r\nthe woods, and there may well have been others among the raiders who, to save\r\nthemselves, had abandoned Father—John Cook, who was clever and knew the\r\nstreets and alleys of the town better than any of us and had friends and even\r\nfamily amongst the townspeople, he was one; and Charlie Tidd was another. I\r\nhad seen neither of them all morning; nor Albert Hazlett and Osborn Anderson,\r\nwho had been stationed alone at the arsenal. The small brick building on\r\nShenandoah Street was close to the town square, and the militiamen, with\r\nguards posted at the doors, were now treating it as if they had taken it back.\r\nAt one point, I noticed a fellow walking exposed on the railroad loading-trestle\r\nthat bordered the armory buildings, and when he neared the firehouse, he\r\ndropped to one knee and peered around the water tower from an angle that\r\nwould have given him an easy rifle-shot into the firehouse, except that he did\r\nnot appear to be armed. Even so, when the door to the firehouse opened, and I\r\nsaw Edwin Coppoc and my brother Oliver standing there, I feared that the man\r\non the trestle would shoot them, for they were exposed and unsuspecting. But,\r\nno, Coppoc spotted the fellow, raised his rifle, and fired, dropping him like a\r\nstone, at which point a second man, who had been following a few yards behind\r\nthe first, shot straight down into the engine house and caught Oliver full-bore in\r\nthe chest, knocking him backwards inside.\r\nCoppocs having killed an apparently unarmed man seemed to fuel the crowd’s\r\ndrunken rage. In minutes, they were dragging their prisoner Will Thompson\r\nfrom the hotel, pummeling and screaming wildly at him.",
    " They set him out on the\r\nedge of the B & O bridge, stepped a few feet away, and shot him many times,\r\nafter which they tossed his body into the river, where the current carried it\r\nagainst a thicket of driftwood. It caught there, and as they had with Willie\r\nLeeman, the townsmen made a target of my brother-in-law and shot into his\r\ndead body for a long while.\r\nAbout mid-afternoon, I noticed a significant number of gun-toting townsmen\r\nseparate themselves from the mob and in an organized way move up\r\nShenandoah Street in the direction of the rifle works, where it appeared that\r\nKagi, Lewis Leary, and John Copeland were still successfully holding off the\r\nmilitia—thanks to the deep, fast-running, twenty-foot-wide channel that cut\r\nbetween the mainland and the island on which the factory was situated. A\r\nfootbridge led from the shore to the island, but the walls of the factory came\r\nright to the water’s edge, as if to a moat, and up to now the militiamen had been\r\nhesitant about rushing it and had contented themselves with keeping the three\r\nraiders inside under siege. Now, however, encouraged by the arrival of a crowd\r\nof heavily armed townsmen, they put up a protective shield of steady gunfire at\r\nthe factory windows, whilst a gang of men ran against the timbered gate with a\r\nbattering-ram and smashed it in. Then the entire combined force of militiamen\r\nand townspeople charged into the factory.\r\nA hundred yards downriver, from my treetop aerie high above the further\r\nshore, I watched three figures—a white man, whom I knew to be Kagi, and two\r\nNegro men, Leary and Copeland—climb out one of the large windows that faced\r\nthe river. The three men hung from the sill above the churning water for a\r\nsecond and then dropped.",
    " In seconds, fifty riflemen were firing down at them\r\nfrom the upper-storey windows, killing John Kagi, who sank beneath the water\r\nalmost at once, and hitting Lewis Leary numerous times but not killing him\r\noutright, for he managed to struggle back to shore downstream a ways, where a\r\ncontingent of militiamen pulled him limp and bleeding up the embankment into\r\ncustody. Copeland made it to a large, flat rock in mid-river, where he was\r\nimmediately spotted by some Jefferson Guards posted on the further shore, who\r\nbegan shooting at him. Caught hopelessly in a cross-fire, he raised his hands in\r\nthe air, and a few minutes later, a pair of fellows rowed out, made him their\r\nprisoner, and saved him from Willie Leeman’s and Will Thompson’s fate for\r\nanother.\r\nThere was a lull until about three P.M., when a B & O train pulled in from the\r\nwest and stopped on a siding at the upper end of the armory, a safe distance\r\nfrom the firehouse. Several dozen civilian riflemen stepped down from the\r\npassenger cars and quickly arranged themselves in assault formation and began\r\nmarching on the firehouse from the rear. They had scaling ladders and got over\r\nthe fence back there with ease and were halfway across the armory grounds\r\nbefore Father and the boys spotted them and began firing out the windows and\r\nthe partly opened door of the firehouse. The raid might have ended there and\r\nthen, but neither of the other two militia companies present in town thought to\r\ncharge the undefended front gate and storm the firehouse, and consequently, in\r\nabout ten minutes, despite taking some serious casualties, Father and his\r\nremaining men managed to drive the first company back out of the armory\r\ngrounds and over the fence.\r\nTowards dusk and starting around four P.M.",
    ", more men rode into town,\r\nuniformed soldiers and officers this time—five companies I counted of the\r\nMaryland Volunteers, and several additional civilian militias from nearby towns\r\nlike Hamtramck and Shepherdstown: hundreds of angry, frightened, armed\r\nwhite Southerners coming in on horseback and by train and on foot, until the\r\ntown square and many of the main streets were filled with federal soldiers, top-\r\nhatted riflemen and sharpshooters in buckskins, excitable slope-shouldered boys\r\nwith pistols, vagrants and drunkards, men, and women, too, carousing and firing\r\ntheir guns into the air and scuffling amongst themselves, and the occasional\r\nmounted U.S. Army officer waving his saber and trying vainly to restore order\r\nand bivouac his men.\r\nExcept for the pall of death that hung over the small, blockaded building at the\r\ncenter, it was a carnival scene down there—chaotic and sensual and violent,\r\nwith torches and a bonfire, and there was even a fiddler, and drunken dancers\r\nlurched up and down the hotel porch. Hawkers were selling food and whiskey,\r\ncaissons and wagons clogged the streets and gouged deep tracks across front\r\nyards, and a riderless, terrified horse galloped down a side street, scattering\r\npeople in all directions, and down by the river, boys were still potshooting at the\r\nbodies of my comrades.\r\nOverhead, the stippled ridges in the white October sky were plated with gold,\r\nand in the east, red and cold, zinc-colored streaks had appeared, as the rain\r\nclouds rippled and broke, and the autumn sun slipped quickly towards the\r\ndarkly shadowed, wooded horizon behind me. It had grown suddenly cold, but\r\nthere was still plenty of bright daylight up on the rocky escarpment, where I\r\nremained clinging to the topmost branches of the highest oak tree.",
    " Down in the\r\ngorge, however, where the two broad, slate-gray rivers converged, the town was\r\nfalling into darkness. It had grown nearly impossible for me to make out what\r\nthis morning I had climbed up into the tree to view and could not bring myself,\r\nthese many hours later, to leave, despite the horror of it—my brothers and my\r\nfriends making their last stand against slavery; and, of course, my father, Father\r\nAbraham, making his terrible, final sacrifice to his God.\r\nIn the end, I could see only the lights—lamps starting to flicker from the\r\nwindows of the houses and public buildings, dancing torches and bonfires\r\ncasting dark, erratic shadows onto the cobbled streets and against the red-brick\r\nsides of the buildings. Occasionally, there was the rattle of gunfire, but it seemed\r\nrandom and almost celebratory, not the sustained noise of combat. An excited\r\nwaiting had begun down there, a tense, almost hysterical pause, as before the\r\npublic execution of a famous criminal. I shifted my position in my roost amongst\r\nthe spindly limbs of the tree, and at that instant from the darkness below heard a\r\nrifle shot ring out, and a bullet tore through the leaves close beside my cheek.\r\nThen a second gun barked, a muzzle-loader this time. I heard the ball crack\r\nagainst a branch a few feet above me, and a flurry of yellow leaves fluttered\r\nacross my head and floated past to the ground. I was awash in the last remaining\r\nlight of day up here, and the soldiers and townspeople below, standing in\r\ndarkness, had finally seen me. A third shot went wide of the mark, but I heard it\r\ntick through the leaves of a nearby tree and saw the leaves fall. A fourth shot\r\nslammed into the trunk just below my foot, and I began frantically to climb\r\ndown, which was difficult, for I had my rifle, useless to me now, and my\r\ncrippled arm. I must get out of the light, was my one thought.",
    " Just a little ways\r\nfurther down, and I, too, will be in darkness and invisible. I let go of my rifle,\r\nheard it clatter to the ground, and felt my way to the next-lower branch. A\r\nwhole crowd of shooters was firing at me now. Bullets zipped through the\r\nfoliage and crackled against the tree, shattering limbs and tossing splinters,\r\ntwigs, and leaves into the air: I saw that I was game, a treed bear, pathetically\r\nlarge and cumbersome, all unable to hide, unable toflee, but still alive and\r\nstruggling to stay alive, still a pleasure to kill. Like the bear, I had fled to the\r\ntopmost branches of the tallest tree in the forest, not, as I had thought, so that I\r\ncould better view my enemy, but in terror and delirium and in the crazed hope\r\nthat I could not be seen there.\r\nWith my left arm, I clamped myself to a slender branch close to my head and\r\nreached down with my right hand to grasp a sturdier limb below. I let my\r\nweight go and groped in the air for a footing, and for a few seconds my body\r\nwas suspended entirely on my poor arm—that childhood curse: never had it so\r\nenraged and humiliated me as now! Suddenly, there was an extended barrage of\r\ngunfire from the town, a booming fusillade, and bullets and balls exploded\r\nthrough the tree all around me, snapping off limbs and showering me with torn\r\nleaves, and I thought, Surely, now, I am a dead man, they will kill me this\r\ninstant, when the limb I clung to with my hooked arm let go. Shot through, it\r\nfloated away from the tree still clamped in the crook of my arm, and I fell,\r\nslamming against the branches, tearing foliage away with my free hand—a long,\r\nclattering drop into the darkness and safety and silence of the forest.\r\nHere in my cabin, I have fallen.",
    " A sympathetic act, no doubt, caused by my\r\naccount of falling, and I watch myself now from outside myself and above, as\r\nastonished and detached as I was that October night on Bolivar Heights, and as I\r\nwas so many years before in the Negro church in Boston, and long, long ago,\r\nwhen I followed my brothers out along the steeply pitched roof and, in falling\r\nagainst the stone steps of the dry-cellar below, betrayed their Sabbath-day flight\r\nand permanently smashed my arm. It is as if a huge, invisible hand above me has\r\npushed me down, or as if since childhood I have been carrying an insupportable\r\nweight and have finally been borne down by it.\r\nI write these words with painful slowness now. I know that I am coming to the\r\nend of my ability to set down my story, which has proved to be not just my\r\nstory, after all, but Father’s as well. His is the one that I had hoped to tell you;\r\nthe other, mine, which lies beneath it, I wished only to tell to Father himself and\r\nmy brothers and comrades, those ghosts standing in the shadow of the mountain\r\nCloudsplitter, the men whose bodies lie buried beneath the great, gray stone in\r\nNorth Elba.\r\nI tell you this so that if you someday read these pages, you will know that I\r\nhave finally gone where I always wanted to go, for this morning, after I fell, I\r\nmanaged in the fading dark to crawl across the cluttered floor to the table and\r\nlocate there my old revolver: it lay cold and heavy as an iron skillet beneath a\r\nsheaf of loose papers, where I had placed it—how long ago? Weeks? Months? A\r\nyear? It doesn’t matter: there is no more time for me, no more chronology. I’m\r\nbecoming my own ghost at last.\r\nFather believed that the universe was a gigantic clockworks, brilliantly lit. But\r\nit’s not. It’s an endless sea of darkness moving beneath a dark sky, between\r\nwhich, isolate bits of light, we constantly rise and fall.",
    " We pass between sea and\r\nsky with unaccountable, humiliating ease, as if there were no firmament\r\nbetween the firmaments, no above or below, here or there, now or then, with\r\nonly the feeble conventions of language, our contrived principles, and our love\r\nof one another’s light to keep our own light from going out: abandon any one of\r\nthem, and we dissolve in darkness like salt in water. For most of my life, surely\r\nsince that day in October when I fled the field at Harpers Ferry, I have been a\r\nsteadily diminishing light—until the day when I began to set down this long\r\naccount, and my light flared up as it never had before. It has continued to burn\r\nbrightly against the night ever since.\r\nBut now there is little left to tell, almost nothing, and soon I will learn if this\r\nhas been all for naught, if this passage between the firmaments has been no\r\nmore than the dying fall of a cinder into the dark waters of the swirling deep.\r\nWhen I have told the little that is left to tell, if I have not died by then and still\r\nhave the bodily strength, I will simply put down my pencil and pick up my\r\nrevolver, and I will use it to place me at my father’s side, where I have always\r\nproperly belonged. If I cannot lie there next to him and my ghost cannot reside\r\nalongside his, then it will mean only that my light went out forever on that night\r\nthose many long years ago at Harpers Ferry, and this account has been but a\r\nmeaningless, phosphorescent flare, the memory of light, instead of the thing\r\nitself, and it will not matter.\r\nHere, Miss Mayo, is all that I have left to tell.\r\nI took the horse and wagon and returned from the schoolhouse to the Kennedy\r\nfarm.",
    " Once there, I pulled the wagon in behind the house, well out of sight from\r\nthe road, and went straight to the storage shed, where in the darkness I groped\r\nover the half-dozen wooden crates that Father and the boys had emptied before\r\nsetting out, when they loaded their wagon with weapons for the slaves. They\r\nhad broken most of the crates apart in the process, and it took several minutes\r\nbefore I found one that was intact and had its topside boards. It was a crate that\r\nhad contained the long pikes, those poles with knives attached that Father had\r\nimagined would terrorize the slaveholders. The box was stoutly constructed of\r\npine and plenty large enough for my purposes, so I carried it to the kitchen and\r\nset it by the stove. Then I commenced filling it from the huge heap of papers and\r\nbooks that lay untouched on the floor where I had placed them the night before.\r\nWhile I was in the midst of this task, I heard a group of horsemen approach\r\nfrom the direction of Harpers Ferry and stop before the house. “Hello, the\r\nhouse!” one of them shouted. “Anyone there?”\r\nI quickly placed the lid onto the half-filled case. Then I lifted it and carried it\r\nout the rear door of the kitchen, where, silently, carefully, as if it were a child’s\r\ncoffin, I set it into the wagon bed. I climbed up on the driver’s box and sat there,\r\nwaiting.\r\nFor several minutes, all was quiet. Then I heard the clump of boots on the\r\nporch at the front of the house, and someone rapped on the door. “It appears\r\nthere ain’t anyone home, Cap’n!” he called back.\r\n“No matter,” came the response. “We got most of what we come for back at\r\nthe schoolhouse anyhow.” A moment later, I heard them leave.\r\nI sat motionless for a long while, until the horse abruptly shifted her weight,\r\nsignaling me to give her direction. But I had no plan. I barely had thoughts.",
    " I\r\nhad spent my entire life following Father’s plans, thinking his thoughts. And at\r\nthat moment, as I sat up on the wagon with the reins in my hands and my horse\r\nimpatient to move on, I did not know what to do or think.\r\nI was in considerable physical pain, for I had cut and bruised myself badly in\r\nmy fall, and my clothes were torn. I was lightly armed—I had my revolver but\r\nno rifle, which I had lost in the darkness after dropping it from my treetop\r\nlookout. And I had no food or supplies or money. But I was alone. Alone, and\r\nfree. The entire continent lay out there. I was a man, a white man, and could go\r\nto any place on it where no one knew me, and I could become new. I could\r\nbecome an American without a history and with no story to tell. I believed that\r\nthen and for many years to come.\r\nSo if I had a plan, that was it. If I had a thought, that was the thought.\r\nAbout the Author\r\nRUSSELL BANKS is the author of thirteen works of fiction, including Rule of the Bone,\r\nThe Sweet Hereafter, Affliction, and Continental Drift. He lives in upstate New\r\nYork.\r\nAuthor’s Note\r\nThis is a work of the imagination. While some of the characters and incidents\r\nportrayed here can be found in accounts of the life and times of John Brown, the\r\nfamous abolitionist, they have been altered and rearranged by the author to suit\r\nthe strict purposes of storytelling. These characters and incidents, despite their\r\nresemblance to actual persons and known events, are therefore the products of\r\nthe author’s imagination. Accordingly, the book should be read solely as a work\r\nof fiction, not as a version or interpretation of history.",
    "\r\nNevertheless, the author wishes to acknowledge with gratitude the help and\r\ninspiration that he has received from Oswald Garrison Villard’s magisterial John\r\nBrown: A Biography Fifty Years After (Boston, 1910), Richard Boyer’s The Legend\r\nof John Brown (New York, 1973), and Stephen Oates’s To Purge This Land with\r\nBlood, second edition (Amherst, Mass., 1984). They are excellent, deep works of\r\nbiographical history. This, it bears repeating, is a work of fiction.\r\nThe author also wishes to acknowledge and thank the many people who so\r\ngenerously provided information, aid, and encouragement, among them: Edwin\r\nCotter, superintendent of the John Brown Farm and Grave, in North Elba, N.Y.;\r\nMichael S. Harper; Thomas Hughes; Paul Matthews, Chuck Wachtel; Cornel\r\nWest; C. K. Williams; friends and colleagues in the Creative Writing Program and\r\nAfrican American Studies at Princeton University; Ellen Levine of the Ellen\r\nLevine Literary Agency; and, most emphatically, Robert Jones of HarperCollins\r\nPublishers.\r\nMORE RAVES FOR\r\nCloudsplitter\r\n“Extraordinary. . . . The most important novel about race published in America\r\nsince William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury.”.\r\n—Baltimore Sun\r\n“Massive, startlingly vivid, morally and intellectually challenging.”\r\n—People\r\n“It is difficult these days to find a book as ambitious, as intelligent and spiritual\r\nand compelling and, simply, as important as Russell Banks’ twelfth work of\r\nfiction Cloudsplitter. But here it is, what I want to call, never before having used\r\nthis term in a review, a great American novel Russell Banks’ achievement in the\r\nwriting of Cloudsplitter is substantial, the novel one of consequence and\r\nsignificance. This book matters, and we as readers can only be thankful to have\r\nheard this voice, Owen Brown’s tale of guilt and liberation, of adventure and\r\nsorrow. This is, indeed, a great American novel.",
    "”\r\n—Brett Lott, News & Observer of Raleigh\r\n“Stunningly absorbing By the time [readers] skid at last into the novel’s final\r\nphrase ... they surely will have collapsed into an exhausted, satisfied heap,\r\noversated with sensation and emotion and knowing they have been under the\r\nspell of a first-rate storyteller who has plunged them not only into the moral and\r\npolitical tremors shuddering through a place and time but also into the heart of\r\na large and exuberant family and deep into one man’s enigmatic soul.”.\r\n—Miami Herald\r\n“Rich and soulful . . . with a sturdy, modern momentum.... A novel of near-\r\nbiblical proportions.”\r\n—New York Times Book Review\r\n“Powerfully told, Cloudsplitter is much more than a historical novel. It is a long\r\nmeditation on America’s shameful enslavement of 4 million people in the land of\r\nthe free. It is also a captivating portrait of a 19th century family.”\r\n—Playboy\r\n“Ambitious and haunting A valuable novel about a significant American and an\r\nimportant reminder of the debilitating effects of race in America.”\r\n—San Frannseo Chronicle\r\n“A pitch-perfect novel.”\r\n—Esquire\r\n“Every writer’s desktop miscellanea should include a statuette of Coleridge’s\r\n‘Ancient Marine’, he who so entrances his listeners that they cannot choose but\r\nhear such a voice speaks through Russell Banks’ new novel, a book the size of a\r\nsmall continent formed not by shale and lava but by themes equally raw and\r\nelemental.”\r\n—Atlanta Journal-Constitution\r\n“Cloudsplitter is breathtaking, and, despite its length, demands to be read at\r\nbreakneck speed.... If you want to know the history of that time, read history. If\r\nyou want to read a superb novel of that time, read Cloudsplitter.”\r\n—San Jose Mercury News\r\n“An epic family tragedy.... A powerful tale of an idealist’s hold on the hearts and\r\nminds of his family.",
    "”\r\n—Boston Sunday Herald\r\n“A vibrant, out-sized, mesmerizing portrait of the mercurial Brown that reveals\r\nhis charm as well as his piety, his compassion as well as his demonic wrath, his\r\nintellect as well as his willfulness.”\r\n—Los Angeles Times Book Review\r\n“A powerful contemporary novel... it tells a crucial story from this nation’s long\r\nepic struggle against racism.”\r\n—Lexington Herald-Leader\r\n“In Cloudsplitter, Russell Banks’ mammoth novel about the raving abolitionist\r\nJohn Brown, we have a character of such scale and complexity that mere history\r\nof biography cannot do him justice. . . .

This is fiction on a large scale, even more ambitious than the\r\nbooks Banks has written before, and the writer carries it off with strength and\r\nsubtlety.”\r\n—Newark Star-Ledger\r\n“A beautiful and terrifying book.”\r\n—Newsday\r\nAlso by Russell Banks\r\nRule of the Bone\r\nThe Sweet Hereafter\r\nAffliction\r\nSuccess Stories\r\nContinental Drift\r\nThe Relation of My Imprisonment\r\nTrailerpark\r\nThe Book of Jamaica\r\nThe New World\r\nHamilton Stark\r\nFamily Life\r\nSearching for Survivors\r\nCredits\r\nCover design © 1998 by Marc Cohen\r\nCover photograph courtesy of The Pasadena Historical Museum, Pasadena, Calif.\r\nCopyright\r\nCLOUDSPUTTER.
